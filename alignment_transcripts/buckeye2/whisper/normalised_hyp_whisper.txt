Recording: (7/ 9621) 
three out of my four children do belong to the catholic church and then my one daughter chose living in oklahoma she is in a baptist church but she is very active within the church very active through the sunday school 

Recording: (8/ 9621) 
right but the ones that are racing are the ones that are the standards in the fields but more and more of those are also available on the web but you have to subscribe to them so it is still an institutional subscription i mean that is a constant problem for the cereals people everywhere it is incredible what is happened with the costs i mean i have seen articles that say some of them have gone up $1000 a year 

Recording: (9/ 9621) 
but what does it tell us about our people we are so naive we have got to look inside ourselves and say what can we bring to society that could be more beneficial and most of the time it is listening 

Recording: (10/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (11/ 9621) 
yeah and it makes it fun so you can actually see what your studying these teams does you can go a whole season 17 18 and 0 and nobody is pretty much coming close to your standard when you win all that money it is just like yeah when you lose all that money it is like that is it i am going home but i have known people that gamble compulsively i mean it is like a gambler is anonymous level i could not really get into that number one i am not the richest person in the world and number two just a little money here is one thing thing but when you are out there spending your car insurance money on it or rent money then you got a real problem there i have seen guys do that too go down to syota downs and bet the farm on one horse and would not even do anything for them 

Recording: (12/ 9621) 
i have learned a lot about cooking lately 

Recording: (13/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (14/ 9621) 
so just trying to take my time do what i want to do yeah 

Recording: (15/ 9621) 
i am a senior and i just started my art major in spring so i still have about four quarters left but i am a senior 

Recording: (16/ 9621) 
hediye etsene 

Recording: (17/ 9621) 
yeah it is projected like six years to finish some of these projects it is unreal well i know when we drove through georgia you actually see people working on the road there is a whole bunch of people and they are all out there working and you get to ohio there is a i do not know something on david letterman had a picture of this and i think i have seen it before that big sign that says your tax dollars at work and there is the construction guy smoking a cigarette leaning up against the side kind of thing it is like great it was kind of funny 

Recording: (18/ 9621) 
it is just the way it is i guess but it is like you know she says if the mother is in the house the mother is on duty 

Recording: (19/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (20/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (21/ 9621) 
right right but at least we had the stuff outside to look at to keep us interested and there was a lot of i have always loved to travel by car yeah it is fun and it is probably because of that early conditioning i have been in 48 states 

Recording: (22/ 9621) 
no it was his mom ran away is what happened 

Recording: (23/ 9621) 
oh yeah by the way 

Recording: (24/ 9621) 
pfft 

Recording: (25/ 9621) 
yeah it is curious is not it 

Recording: (26/ 9621) 
i do not think it is really something that they need to really to do to it they will come by it i mean actually i mean i could see that they could at least take the money from it and put it to better use of some sort if they did the same kind of thing 

Recording: (27/ 9621) 
because not only is he a chauvinist pig but he is a bigot too a racist yeah so 

Recording: (28/ 9621) 
all you do is you just keep your records of what you spend on things and then there is a form you fill out and how much you have if you have taken any depreciation you need to basically put that back in and deduct your cost and then there is a percentage that goes on your schedule e that goes on the front of your form that goes into your income and then it is just taxed it is really not that hard 

Recording: (29/ 9621) 
i hope they keep it 

Recording: (30/ 9621) 
he is lying 

Recording: (31/ 9621) 
yeah i really really hate the fact of government telling me what to do 

Recording: (32/ 9621) 
i must have been thinking the freshman class just ride along i think the freshmen would be a little bit tougher it would be tougher to be walking around in different areas like me i did not know where this hall was i was out there with 50 million halls around me and just stopped once and i said where is lazenby and they went that way not too far from where i parked 

Recording: (33/ 9621) 
and that is the way i felt about it i am not saying that that is not a possibility but 

Recording: (34/ 9621) 
it will make the catalogs real small and we have like five hundred thousand things and what the catalog has like a hundred of them and that is really annoying to then people call up with all these like things that we like do not know if we have our computers are really really old it is like an old style mainframe 

Recording: (35/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (36/ 9621) 
i tell you it is mine now 

Recording: (37/ 9621) 
oh yeah exactly i was just wondering how can i get a job doing what you are doing 

Recording: (38/ 9621) 
mhm 

Recording: (39/ 9621) 
or take me to court again they got the money i do not 

Recording: (40/ 9621) 
mmm 

Recording: (41/ 9621) 
yes she believes all men will cheat 

Recording: (42/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (43/ 9621) 
so were you thinking of going somewhere else like an ivy league school or something like that so how did you find out about the program my counselor just kind of found it and he had posted it and he especially tried to notify the national merit people about it and i was the only one who really caught it even though the other ones like half of them wanted to go to medical school they all one of them is at princeton right now you know they are all off at their ivy leagues like basically working their butts off to get in when i am already in i do not totally understand it 

Recording: (44/ 9621) 
well it 

Recording: (45/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (46/ 9621) 
it is all over they contract with dominion homes and dominion is seems like it is going up everywhere and mi so they are all over they have projects all over 

Recording: (47/ 9621) 
she just wants to get it over with 

Recording: (48/ 9621) 
even harder 

Recording: (49/ 9621) 
yeah it is 70 years old 

Recording: (50/ 9621) 
and they are not accurate 

Recording: (51/ 9621) 
i know i do not i do not want to go i do not want to touch the computer when i go home 

Recording: (52/ 9621) 
that is true 

Recording: (53/ 9621) 
oh yeah yeah and i think even if you are aware of everything that is here you still in the back of your mind you just have that it is just columbus it is just columbus maybe it is because people do not take advantage of do not realize what is actually here do not realize how it i mean yeah it is not chicago it is not new york it is not san francisco there is a lot of places it is not but it is not a backwater either well they need to get out more i mean all this oh we will never be a major league city until we have major league sports well you know i guess getting out more would not help those people that would be such a small part of civilization anywhere for me and i am pretty pleased with the way things are moving along and i just i really do think people do not take advantage of it the way they should 

Recording: (54/ 9621) 
really i think it is really good for women to learn about this we should have known about this 20 years ago all these women i know 

Recording: (55/ 9621) 
so she is very limited on working in closed corners and stuff like that so she is basically disabled and that goes when they do that it is because of your education and also they take in consideration everything 

Recording: (56/ 9621) 
which i think is kind of nice so i mean it looks like the facilities are pretty comfortable i mean my biggest thing is i just want to have a room all to myself you know i do not want to go someplace where i am going to have to like deal with somebody else in there so i mean it looks nice but i would be more comfortable at home i think once i go home 

Recording: (57/ 9621) 
i never learned math we had in fifth grade we had the principal realized that nobody knew their times tables we had a big pizza party planned for 

Recording: (58/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (59/ 9621) 
so any other impressions of columbus impressions of columbus well number one i did not realize that it was as big as it is until i started working for the courier service you know i have heard people say and i know it is true that columbus is one of the top ten largest cities in the united states and i was like you are kidding me really i started driving around and i am like yeah it is this place is huge this place is absolutely behemoth i mean everything within 270 it is pretty darn big and that was really surprising i love i just love living in a big city it is just it is just everything is so different than living in the country i miss the big expanses of grass out in the country but i can skate all over the place here in town which i can not do at home i mean i could skate on our driveway but it stops abruptly in stones so it gets real boring i mean going downhill is really fun but going back up is a pain in the neck but there is a lot more people here i like lots of people i have discovered i like having lots of people around meeting all sorts of new and interesting and unique people and every year there is a whole new crowd of freshmen that come in new people coming and going postdocs like me coming and going i am only going to be here for a year or so really think tank the republican think tank so aside from the college the town is pretty much agricultural i do not know why anybody would want to live there unless they are raising a family because if they are raising a family it is a great place great community great all around for raising a family no no i want to find someplace similar to that i want to find someplace similar to that in colorado yeah i love colorado beautiful state got some good skiing yeah skating skiing that is how i did this tore my acl two years ago christmas day after christmas it is a tendon right in the front of your knee that keeps your knee from moving out and doing all sorts of other miscellaneous twisting and turning positions that it is not really supposed to but i ripped that right in half so what would you do to improve columbus well for one this place is dirty as crap it is just so 

Recording: (60/ 9621) 
well i often have to write on papers i believe you turned in the wrong paper i believe i got the rough draft instead of the final copy do you have the final copy somewhere at home 

Recording: (61/ 9621) 
yeah ellen at lane avenue has been a big booster of my work i mean i was really lucky to run across her 

Recording: (62/ 9621) 
it does 

Recording: (63/ 9621) 
and he could not have any kind of caffeine otherwise he would get the shakes and he took all kinds of pills 

Recording: (64/ 9621) 
yeah so that is taking some running around 

Recording: (65/ 9621) 
i think some of it was that i think a lot of it is you do feel lonely you do go through a period in your life where you do not feel like you have any friends or you feel totally different i mean i still go through that i think we all go through that at some point rather even yearly for some of us so i am just saying if he felt like he could go to somebody either in his family i say he using those for example or the parents paid a little bit more attention and did not have that blind eye i think that is part of your responsibility as a parent that if you see something potentially evil or wrongdoing in your child is eyes you need to really admit it i mean you do not want to do that 

Recording: (66/ 9621) 
no no i am interested 

Recording: (67/ 9621) 
the lower grades we have a few male teachers at first grade and fourth grade but not many but i think that young men young boys would do better in a setting in school if they had a man earlier on rather than having to wait until they are in middle school to relate to a coach and up until then it is always been a woman 

Recording: (68/ 9621) 
and this one could die so 

Recording: (69/ 9621) 
좋아 

Recording: (70/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (71/ 9621) 
you know my daughter you know there is just a lot of stuff when she was in high school and i would call up to the school and you know the principal like he would say miss you know i am i am her last chance you know my daughter was going to summer school every summer and he is like mrs you know she is she is like you know the average student she is the type you know that she is going to get you know she is going to get through college you know she is just one of those you know that just moves right along you know she is not the brightest you know but she is bright enough those are your average professional people out working today i was just like well i just want more help for my daughter i just want somebody to jerk her down 

Recording: (72/ 9621) 
that is great 

Recording: (73/ 9621) 
they just called me on the phone not knowing you know just that she went to the hospital well they said to me will you stay well i said yes but then when it got into two weeks and i was not getting any support from the principal or no aid or anything it is like i am sorry i am a substitute substitute i am getting $60 a day i can not do this unless you know i have more help and i just flatly said that i am sorry i mean if i did if it was my own job i would have struggled with it but it was not my own job and i did not know what was gonna happen so if they would have gotten some help in there for me i would have stayed perhaps but no i you know you can work for underpay and understaff and you can not do everything 

Recording: (74/ 9621) 
threatening her and stuff like that and uh which all i would have to do is get on the phone and sit there and say you know i can be out there in about two hours you know so i do not know what your problem is but you need to get you to talk to me about it talk to your mom about it go see somebody else and talk to him about it 

Recording: (75/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (76/ 9621) 
and decide to go back for their jobs if you notice the first time that they voted they voted down this proposal the proposal that they are voting on this week is the exact same one 

Recording: (77/ 9621) 
and i am just using that as an example i mean your other drugs i do not know much about them 

Recording: (78/ 9621) 
they could do it my one granddaughter they live in springfield they just moved to springfield and she goes to kindergarten only a half day and this child is only five years old he has them reading the newspaper watching the news she told me a story about christopher columbus discovering america that was so deep and intense i could not believe it was coming from a fiveyearold so this is what the teacher is doing down there 

Recording: (79/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (80/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (81/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (82/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (83/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (84/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (85/ 9621) 
no there was a lot of conflict at home my dad had to support us there were four of us and our mother has disabilities and she was kind of crazy 

Recording: (86/ 9621) 
i think it is probably too though that a lot of people are not used to it i mean they are not from ohio i have found that in columbus a lot so they are kind of more tentative or they are from the south or something like that so then you run into a lot of people that are from ohio but i have noticed that a lot of people rarely do you meet people born and raised in columbus 

Recording: (87/ 9621) 
oh okay that was easy 

Recording: (88/ 9621) 
and he is real because people give him that 

Recording: (89/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (90/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (91/ 9621) 
so basically well yeah it might work but to me it is kind of stupid you know because what you are saying is we are going to take this law and we are really going to stick you on this law but to hell with all the other laws so is that really fair 

Recording: (92/ 9621) 
that is great 

Recording: (93/ 9621) 
i was alright 

Recording: (94/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (95/ 9621) 
hell 

Recording: (96/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (97/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (98/ 9621) 
he is a subcontractor if someone is got a job to do at their house he will do it we just went and tore the cabins out of a house that was on fire because of the smoke damage 

Recording: (99/ 9621) 
the hours with because jason works during the day too so it would probably work out pretty well for us 

Recording: (100/ 9621) 
all of his problems have been personal problems that really should not have been touched on except the media got into it i mean we look up to the president to be a moral man whatever but if you look at the other nations they were not that shocked that a president would do something like that 

Recording: (101/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (102/ 9621) 
boy that is a really tough one i had not thought about that and high school kids are so touchy about i mean touchy about sexual identity and so insecure in their own that they are really likely to come down hard on somebody who has a different orientation and i do not know i do not know 

Recording: (103/ 9621) 
i went to just a little easter here in high school 

Recording: (104/ 9621) 
he works in a factory 

Recording: (105/ 9621) 
all those years after i left at school here was that the bureau of employment services i worked like 20 years with research and statistics labor market information federal state programs collecting information on three different programs in that time then i worked for about a year and a half on a special project they were automating the employment services activities and they were going a completely different direction to match job needs of employers and applicants to get more placements for interviews and that sort of thing and i developed that method the mechanism the checklist and stuff i worked on that and then i worked for the last three years in jobs training for economically disadvantaged youth adults and dislocated workers 

Recording: (106/ 9621) 
and one of them they looked at in columbus was how well he was doing in school well children have one of the highest dropout rates in schools they are not doing well so they need to be taught differently and then they cut this money my feeling is there is a lot of programs in school that is sponsored by the federal government particularly to help the students that are behind and that is important 

Recording: (107/ 9621) 
when they are giving a $4000 or $5000 a year to someone who is making $200000 or $300000 i do not care if i get $5000 that will not even buy me a tank of gas today keep the money and do something good with it 

Recording: (108/ 9621) 
have you ever had a concern that you in the box spring on the floor and i have got like comforters on the side of the bed so because he is like he like get out he is like i do not want to be in the bed with these guys and he will get on the floor and he will sleep on the comforters on the floor but he is close and he is happy that way 

Recording: (109/ 9621) 
yes hopefully 

Recording: (110/ 9621) 
you have a preference at five or six but by the time you turn eight one of your hemispheres has pretty much decided it is going to be the one that runs the show well then that is when those reversals and all that backward fives and threes and stuff usually drops out of the picture so hmm 

Recording: (111/ 9621) 
mhm 

Recording: (112/ 9621) 
hahahaha 

Recording: (113/ 9621) 
i travel traveling is been all i have even for the transportation term i travel across the state and country and before that i was always traveling we took two weeks off when we go back to fall semester back time of semester not quarters and we get on a greyhound bus $50 pass was and buddy and i would just travel all over the country and sleep in the bus at night 

Recording: (114/ 9621) 
and it is wild it just seems like the music has not gone anywhere because they keep going back to the 70s you know the rolling stones go touring or pink floyd or you know these are groups from back then where are these people that are supposed to have taken over for these people they are not there you know and the quality of the music just must not be there my daughter is into the britney spears and the backstreet boys nsync all of a sudden now we are starting to get into some of that that is starting to get a little interesting too as far as music choices and wanting to listen get them the sony walkman and then you do not have to listen to it they did not have that when we were kids probably i remember our car had an am radio in it and that was it yeah yeah yeah on an album and now the kids are like i want the cd put the cd in yeah yeah 

Recording: (115/ 9621) 
in insurance off and on working for independent insurance agents so i did that until i came to a company that i stayed with for seven years and then they relocated to dallas so yeah 

Recording: (116/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (117/ 9621) 
yeah and it is like number one in the union and that is like such a disturbing fact to me that you could take someone is life and be like oh our bad that person was innocent you know 

Recording: (118/ 9621) 
ha 

Recording: (119/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (120/ 9621)

Recording: (121/ 9621) 
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah 

Recording: (122/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (123/ 9621) 
and why what he is too busy 

Recording: (124/ 9621) 
that is what i am talking about 

Recording: (125/ 9621) 
you know ai not no way in hell you would have one nowadays 

Recording: (126/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (127/ 9621) 
he has the most experience 

Recording: (128/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (129/ 9621) 
because they bypassed me and straight ma ma ma 

Recording: (130/ 9621) 
yeah my parents live in akron like north of akron kygo falls area but like i said i had an apartment down there but for the summer i am down here so i am a transient always moving my stuff 

Recording: (131/ 9621) 
you know decide where you are going why do you just waste all your time running around like that 

Recording: (132/ 9621) 
so he did it well he is always had some problems his problem is staying focused on things unless it is something he is extremely interested in then you can not get him away from it if it is something he would be it is just an example in school he would sit there and he would be rolling around on the floor and stuff while they are trying to teach something in class or working on a writing assignment or something they had a half hour to work on it for the last five minutes the teacher said you know you really need to get that done he would sit down and write it in the fifth grade he was writing on a college level and he could do it that quickly i think he is lost ground on that now and that was just an example in the second grade the school he went to was an open classroom and he had been through a couple of traditional schools already and the principal said we talked to the principal about the problems we were having with him staying focused and she said well we can work with that well how about halfway through the year she said it is not working and they have an arrangement with and i doubt if most of the parents in the school are even aware of this with children is hospital counseling center they set a room aside and they send counselors in once a month to work with the students it is an open classroom it is experimental so there is people coming and going all the time and we were never aware of it i doubt if most of the people are aware of it and they met with us and then a week later they went and observed him and he was they were the teacher was telling a story and then asking questions about it and he said he was the counselor said he was up and walking around and running around and playing with his shoes and stuff like that she said but it came time to answer the questions he knew every answer so he said they decided not to proceed at that time because this is frustrating too it was our wedding anniversary and my wife said now how about for our wedding anniversary we just get a good report for the whole week that was unusual and he was not a bad kid 

Recording: (133/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (134/ 9621) 
and just start picking a fight with him 

Recording: (135/ 9621) 
i am just kidding 

Recording: (136/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (137/ 9621) 
you will know it is me by the cup 

Recording: (138/ 9621) 
in belgium as its own country 

Recording: (139/ 9621) 
and a lot of them has been getting off the hook lately you see this guy on hard copy he killed this woman is husband because he was in love with her and they ended up letting him go because he was supposedly incapable of making his own decisions now i think that there is things in your brain that trigger ideas and if you have a wide you know wider version of what they i do not know what they call it it is in that magazine there what triggers the violence and violent thoughts people actually do think more about the violence when they commit it than the accidental you know some of it is mindless some of it is not but everybody thinks 

Recording: (140/ 9621) 
professors yeah well as i mentioned a while ago i happen to have i am one of 15 siblings 

Recording: (141/ 9621) 
it is a great experience even when we were having problems with him and stuff it was great he could not understand my wife once told me she says you know something about spending time together she said that there is no time that we spend with you that is wasted and he could not understand that she said you mean this is fun i said i did not say it was fun 

Recording: (142/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (143/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (144/ 9621)

Recording: (148/ 9621) 
no they thought it was my dad told me later he thought i was getting sent off just by myself you know 

Recording: (149/ 9621) 
hmm 

Recording: (150/ 9621) 
and outside of english french is a horribly popular language for different countries to have as a second language so i think it would be extraordinarily useful to me now if i had a greater understanding of french 

Recording: (151/ 9621) 
well they always did because the first time i had one i was 36 years old 

Recording: (152/ 9621) 
yeah it is very my sister has an undergrad in psychology and she worked at like one of those what do you call those secretive houses like for women and their badder children that you know you are not supposed to know the location and whatnot and she used to get so frustrated because they would always go back 

Recording: (153/ 9621) 
they do not have that for columbus schools 

Recording: (154/ 9621) 
nobody really admits it but oh i grabbed the paper because i want to see what the agreement was and it is pretty much the same thing and they are voting positively for it this time 

Recording: (155/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (156/ 9621) 
yeah he did 

Recording: (157/ 9621)

Recording: (175/ 9621) 
right right that is the amazing thing about this country is that there is enough space in the united states and north america that you can have all these incredible monstrosity developments and still be able to find relatively wild places between them yeah 

Recording: (176/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (177/ 9621) 
i come back and it is just

Recording: (181/ 9621) 
i got into painting somewhat recently i have always done a lot of art my mom is an elementary school art teacher so i was always exposed to art as a child i did pretty good too but i never got into painting it was mainly drawing that kind of thing and just three or four years ago i thought i am going to learn how to paint and i learned how to paint

Recording: (185/ 9621) 
well yeah under certain 

Recording: (186/ 9621) 
no no but that is what i am saying but that is what i am saying the same thing is happening when we had a bus thing we took kids out of the poor environment and put them in a nice environment oh they got the taste of it and then went back home and we did a very unjust thing to those kids and to the families and then when we broke them up we did something else we lost that community involvement so now the parents can not follow their kids to their activities again splitting it up hey we do not want families that is a misnomer they said the community raises the family the kids yeah that is how they want you to think but the community will not replace the family

Recording: (191/ 9621) 
well and 

Recording: (192/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (193/ 9621) 
it is the way i feel 

Recording: (194/ 9621) 
mmm 

Recording: (195/ 9621) 
right after high school i think there was probably i will say six and amazingly well three were still together 

Recording: (196/ 9621) 
but they all look alike 

Recording: (197/ 9621) 
no no but 

Recording: (198/ 9621) 
janet we just had a man who took time to show us 

Recording: (199/ 9621) 
oh okay 

Recording: (200/ 9621) 
aww that is nice yeah i am sure 

Recording: (201/ 9621) 
eh 

Recording: (202/ 9621) 
that is true 

Recording: (203/ 9621) 
they stopped federally funding osu that was a federal control tower and they contracted it out so you either lost your job and stayed there and worked for the contractor or you picked up and moved on and you know some people move like to arizona and california and i thought well since i only have like two and a half years until i retire and i really like columbus and i thought i do not want to uproot my daughters out of school and leave and start over so i thought well i will just go to port columbus and suffer it out until i can 

Recording: (204/ 9621) 
so i guess i mean that was really really hard for me i would call all my family members i had family members coming over to try to figure out what this child needed but i do not know i could not tell you what he went through with that crying spell but he did go through that where he just did not quit crying 

Recording: (205/ 9621) 
i try to be as much as possible too i think it is very important that both parents they see both 

Recording: (206/ 9621) 
take the ferry from south east london 

Recording: (207/ 9621) 
city council of dayton and had highlighted a whole bunch of it and hoping that they would do something along that line should have gone to columbus at the same time 

Recording: (208/ 9621) 
bye 

Recording: (209/ 9621) 
yeah and i really think both of them will be good parents someday but she says we are not ready 

Recording: (210/ 9621) 
my dad seems to think i should go into law because there is law in everything you can do anything with a law degree 

Recording: (211/ 9621) 
well personally i voted that the 33 should pass i think they should the way i understood they have ways of wording those things but you have to read it very carefully to know whether you should say yes or no on a thing i said yes because i analyzed it to say that they are repealing something that was passed i think one or two years ago that was allowing things to be done up around the polaris area like new roads and and this and that and i want that repealed because i do not think we should be helping anybody else to do that and taking the money away from the other things 

Recording: (212/ 9621) 
oh my god 

Recording: (213/ 9621) 
they just like it a little less or dislike it a little more when it looks like it is gonna come to something it feels like they are trying to tease me as an audience and that is not something i feel teased by particularly 

Recording: (214/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (215/ 9621) 
kind 

Recording: (216/ 9621) 
could not even think about asking 

Recording: (217/ 9621) 
yeah i thought in the beginning i missed mirror lake cafe so bad said the good subs and all that i do not i do not know why i missed them i do not i go back and i just do not like it anymore

yes 

Recording: (219/ 9621) 
whenever he runs well i thought he was going to be elected mayor too but he did not there but i do not know what that was about but you know he is got his constituents and they are going to reelect him because he stands up for the minority i think what he makes a mistake is labeling things racist that are not necessarily racist but anyway 

Recording: (220/ 9621) 
we are 

Recording: (221/ 9621) 
yeah it is just like having alcohol around i mean gambling is a lot like alcohol it can be addicting it can screw your life up and you will spend your last dollar on it if you are that far gone so pretty much anything can be one of those factors 

Recording: (222/ 9621) 
um irish people adopting like italian babies or something like that i mean it is no different i mean as long as basically you know your roots and where you came from i mean i can not see it being a problem of any sorts i mean just as long as they have someone that cares for the kid and does stuff for him i mean i can not see it being any 

Recording: (223/ 9621) 
i personally agree with that but that is just from my own moral beliefs and everything but i do not know i do not think that there is one solution that will fit every child in every situation i mean my husband had his daughter when he was 17 so you know obviously he said his dad told him about condoms you know so they are going to make that decision on their own i would say just and plus with the internet and everything they have access to so much information i think that it falls back on the parents still if you are going to be a parent you need to be responsible and i do not think that it is getting done 

Recording: (224/ 9621) 
i know 

Recording: (225/ 9621) 
um in general i think i think the united states has a fairly well developed like class not like class structure in which you can not move up or down but like we have a fairly large middle class 

Recording: (226/ 9621) 
yeah and 

Recording: (227/ 9621) 
lower that is right yeah

Recording: (246/ 9621) 
hahaha 

Recording: (247/ 9621) 
i am sorry i said that to mean anything 

Recording: (248/ 9621) 
well i have i have two uncles that are southern baptist ministers and used to be when we would visit them in the mid60s we would have to go i mean if mean if you visit your relative if your relatives visit and you are a minister you have to go to church but the thing is is southern baptist service always has that period where you are 

Recording: (249/ 9621) 
i do not think so in new york it might be like i say it is a lot more competitive there here i think columbus is and the midwest in general i think is much more open 

Recording: (250/ 9621) 
yeah there is some people there just get lazy then you got the college students i do not know how many of them work but most of them there is just from out of town 

Recording: (251/ 9621) 
no it is just a regular old rentacop with his own van he would hop in i will give you a ride and drove me to the corner of the middle of nowhere in accordance to where i live and then i had to walk all the way home 

Recording: (252/ 9621) 
one of the requirements is we have to be in the honors college during undergraduate and fulfill all the requirements there 

Recording: (253/ 9621) 
never thought he was any better than anybody else he was always there to help out if he could but then some people like you say some people were not that way 

Recording: (254/ 9621) 
oh yeah they were more settled 

Recording: (255/ 9621) 
yeah yeah they are pretty good where i live last year when we had that really really high snow i shoveled and then like an hour later it blew over so it was like what is the point but our neighborhood has a lot of children so most of the people do shovel their sidewalks 

Recording: (256/ 9621) 
she believes no man will love you so much not to cheat and i do not believe that so i am not with her son 

Recording: (257/ 9621) 
they are fun 

Recording: (258/ 9621) 
i knew that kindergarten because it is not required in the state of ohio anyway they really are not required to be in school or enrolled in anything until they are six by september when i found that out i was like oh okay cool you know i can keep him home i mean he could probably go into the second grade i mean he is very bright he can read and write and add so it is a challenge for me 

Recording: (259/ 9621) 
so i am not going to get any fairness or justice out of that but uh so they sent me the award saying that they sided in their favor and all that crap well you know fine um but i am not gonna i am not gonna pay him until they contact me again 

Recording: (260/ 9621) 
it is funny because i studied russian but a lot of the people i served with were fluent in spanish or something else so it is like i do not know why they got sent there but it is i mean we really believe that it is inspired they send your name and a picture and your application to the prophet who is the head of the church and they pray over it and they decide where you go 

Recording: (261/ 9621) 
yeah right yeah we could put a little trailer there we would be outside most of the time anyway 

Recording: (262/ 9621) 
you know it do not matter what they are 

Recording: (263/ 9621) 
it is not really an office he is like a supervisor that just goes to the different job sites he tells the crew members what houses to work on and which ones are ready and then he gets to talk with the other contractors and he works together with them but he is really just there is a main place where they park all their trucks and then he just goes to the different sites 

Recording: (264/ 9621) 
i do not know she is getting a second child now it is getting a little harder 

Recording: (265/ 9621) 
we will try 

Recording: (266/ 9621) 
heh heh heh 

Recording: (267/ 9621) 
i just hope he stays around i do not know maybe not but i grew up without a father and i really have that against my father because he lived around us he never called us you know and i really got resentment against him 

Recording: (268/ 9621) 
yeah you can not have a beer gut and a big ass and it means you are sloppy and lazy if you do but if a man does it is like my god he is probably got some power behind him and it is like duh he is probably just as lazy as anybody else it is like i hate to see girls starving themselves to death it is like there are certain times in your life where you are gonna be fat my youngest daughter has a problem with that i do not know why she is so insecure because she out of the four of us including her sister is like right at the top she has done television commercials she is done radio voiceovers she is been in plays she was in a high school play when she was a kindergarten student and actually had a speaking part i am sitting there in the audience in tears i am like why am i crying a doing this that is about how good i am in those and she is just like you know and she is not a smart ass you know she does not show off but she is just so relaxed doing this and it is it looks so natural but she does not see that cause you know you know she always thinks she is very mediocre and i go but you know i said you know you have been in front of television cameras and you do so well i said you get on the radio you do well i said you do well in school you have a ton of friends i said you have a great body i said you know i said i never compare the two of them but there are some times when i have to i said look at your sister she has the same chest i do i said you definitely are well built there i said you have a nice shape i said when you have a bathing suit on it is like i go somebody put a towel on her you know and i said you know you just do not realize all the physical and and also the character attributes you have i said you have a great personality i said you go in a room of 100 people with me and your sister and about three days later somebody will go john and jelena who but in 10 minutes they will go where is janelle at because they all know you you are just so easy to get along with and everybody likes you and i said you just do not realize this gigantic list of character physical and mental traits you have that i can never even come close to having 

Recording: (269/ 9621) 
that is not because i am skilled or anything it is because when i was a kid my dad was crippled i had to fix everything 

Recording: (270/ 9621) 
he is limited his meat a little bit more but with men it is a lot harder when they are used to meat and potato kind of families but like thanksgiving it just does not mean that much to me the family thing does but the turkey i do not cook it very often my sister we used to get it 

Recording: (271/ 9621) 
you are like hell no i am not paying for those damn cats you are like honey it is just a cat you know it is my baby you can come home and visit at any time i am not paying all right 

Recording: (272/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (273/ 9621) 
yeah there are times when you know just there is a group over there called star check 

Recording: (274/ 9621) 
i am so sorry 

Recording: (275/ 9621) 
would you do oh god i feel like i was a parent before i was a parent that is the way it felt some of my friends like this guy i used to hang out with he used to run into lockers in high school that is so kid 

Recording: (276/ 9621) 
and that type of person i do not think would make a very effective president because i do not know president needs to be able to think fast on their feet 

Recording: (277/ 9621) 
that is bishop reedy it is a catholic school over on the west side 

Recording: (278/ 9621) 
yeah somebody is got to get you know put george bush to the back 

Recording: (279/ 9621) 
yeah yeah that is 

Recording: (280/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (281/ 9621) 
i think it fills its niche you know i mean wexner has a niche and the museum has a niche and i think it fills it very well 

Recording: (282/ 9621) 
that so that if you if whoever won you know would get but we just went on field trips and had a great time it might be better now 

Recording: (283/ 9621) 
he is going to be there all summer i did not decide i wanted to change it over until i got my scanner and found out that when i checked the website for the scanner that they are just simply flat out not making windows 2000 drivers for my scanner so it is a crap i do not know i just got it i can not even remember what it is um pay per port i think it is pay per port avoid windows 2000 at all costs stick with 98 much better much better operating system 

Recording: (284/ 9621) 
do not go into elementary ed that much 

Recording: (285/ 9621) 
well i enjoy this but it will be impersonal because here you are i can not face you i do not know whether you are really kidding me and what you are talking about i was sitting there in that street cafe or not but i really do think we are going to be interconnected in that sense and it becomes so much more impersonal i guess i am very strong about the term personal versus impersonal in any communications and the bad that we have talked about i think will be a part of that 10 and 20 years from now but i think we will have begun by that time to try to clean up the act if you will going back to the political question i think the financial things i think we will start slowing that down i think we will have less influence in the terms of finances i do not think we will get back to abraham lincoln days but if we can swing that pendulum back i think we can i think we will i think we can do the same thing with communications i think we can eliminate a lot of the bad bad influences i do know that over time what we would have called bad back here is not necessarily bad here it is sort of like the definition of need versus luxury those definitions change the definition of socialism and democracy they slowly have changed over these times well the same thing will be true with those it is still functioning excuse me and i think we will also slowly swing that pendulum on back to the and to the family again there are those doomsayers from my point of view are saying that in many years to come there will not not be such a thing as a family it is just you you go out here you meet a an opposite sex you procreate and you go on your way she goes on her way and she is just as satisfied about going her way as you are going your way yes a lot of that is true but i think that i think that do not think that is going to ever happen i think we will turn that thing around i think the socalled divorce rate program as i talked about a while ago every 50 percent of the people who marry within five years are no longer together i think that will will change and that is a very significant thing i think in terms of getting back to the basic family 

Recording: (286/ 9621) 
i feel like i should be standing out there giving money because my bills are getting high 

Recording: (287/ 9621) 
mmm 

Recording: (288/ 9621) 
i am not sure i am ready to go back through all of that 

Recording: (289/ 9621) 
absent for the whole day which would be considered truant so they said what i had to do was go down to juvenile to this certain gentleman in juvenile and have him file charges so i took my son down to him and he said it was the school should have did that so in the meantime he is telling me that my son is getting ready to go to 11th grade and neither side is gonna do anything about it somebody should have did something about that because then you know they would have been doing what they were supposed to do to make him you know get line and so he knew he could get by with it 

Recording: (290/ 9621) 
and the fact that i recognized all that and could not wait to get out of there and when i was gone i was gone and even now we still have this ongoing thing where my family in fact i have been real unhappy about them lately because we have lived in our same house for 20 years and my parents they live in florida i mean they are not well to do by any means but they are not lacking and they can afford to take plane trips and they can afford to go to california twice a year to spend a week with my brother et cetera et cetera and they come here a couple times a year and they stay at my sister is house they have only come to my home three times in 20 years and it is because they do not want to get off the freeway they will drive through columbus from florida to go to visit people in akron and maslin and they stay in cincinnati and they stay in springfield with my sisters and they will not do it because it is just too much they do not want to have to deal with that traffic they do not like that and it is and just recently i finally said you know i do not understand why you can not do that you know i have actually called them on i am 52 

Recording: (291/ 9621) 
i would say there would be certain life application things that all kids should know but not i do not think that you can say everything you know you have everybody has to do this because you know people are individuals and you have to take that into consideration i think so 

Recording: (292/ 9621) 
i know 

Recording: (293/ 9621) 
yeah it was 

Recording: (294/ 9621) 
why really think that is happening right now because i think that i do not know what the divorce statistics have been recently but i do see that more people who are getting married are staying married because those that do not those that would have gotten a divorce they are not bothering to get married to begin with they are just living together and if they separate so what and i think that 

Recording: (295/ 9621) 
i talk to him every now and then 

Recording: (296/ 9621) 
you know white napkins and you know we would go there for lunch you know you would dress nice and you know i liked that and i would like you know my grandkids to be able to go downtown with me like that you know rather than have to drive off to a mall 

Recording: (297/ 9621) 
yeah that part was no different man 

Recording: (298/ 9621) 
they had a 2 by 4 on the door for over a month 

Recording: (299/ 9621) 
now that would go over well here would not it 

Recording: (300/ 9621) 
so the crowd will 

Recording: (301/ 9621) 
i mean he would have been in the money then because he was just starting his business down there and while i was down there he had me sleeping in a truck a moving truck and oh man it is a hilarious story i mean 30 foot moving truck and i am sleeping in it 

Recording: (302/ 9621) 
now who does he work for 

Recording: (303/ 9621) 
and some of that is controlled with medication now but not all of it because of the drug and alcohol they will not put him on some of the medications but as far as i can tell he is been pretty clear and clean on that and once she got pregnant they both stopped smoking she is taking very good care of herself she lately has been going with him to the psychologist and we have been paying for her but we do not have a problem with that because he is going he likes the psychologist so it took a long time to get to that point so we have been talking to the psychologist about it he said most people that are raised in that background he said they go different ways one they just fall into the same pattern as their parents or their survivor and she appears to be a survivor she is never really had what i would call a normal family relationship she likes to spend time with us which i am glad and we really like her we enjoy being with her but sometimes more than being with my son 

Recording: (304/ 9621) 
so i try to gear what he watches towards educational programming instead of just junk 

Recording: (305/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (306/ 9621) 
and just took it and ripped it 

Recording: (307/ 9621) 
i do not know it is possible but i can not imagine it would not knowing how big it is going to get i guess i can not imagine 

Recording: (308/ 9621) 
i do not know i do not want to get shot 

Recording: (309/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (310/ 9621) 
all right 

Recording: (311/ 9621) 
it is like down a hill kinda by the horseshoe yeah so that is where we go and i do not have a student id so i just sneak in but it is the summer they do not even care they never 

Recording: (312/ 9621) 
i think they should i think a lot of the fear of this material comes from people who hold the belief that you choose your orientation that you can be converted to homosexuality and i personally do not believe that so i am not afraid of it but i can see how people would hold the opposite view and that is where this comes from but since i think they are wrong i think it should be my way and i think the material should be there i think it should be dealt with in a calm and reasonable way and i think it should be accessible to the kids 

Recording: (313/ 9621) 
yeah yeah i heard something about that 

Recording: (314/ 9621) 
i retired about four years ago from the state i worked there for 30 years actually i started working for the state when i worked here and that count those five years counted towards retirement so i was able to retire early and then the last about the last two and a half years i have been working at the symphony in the box office started part time and then i was full time for a while and then i requested to be cut back to part time again 

Recording: (315/ 9621) 
i am going to keep doing the same stuff i will find some other kids somewhere else my husband and i will have time together i always have a project i am always saying well when things slow down around here like right now i should be home counting money i do the fundraiser for the school we just sell morley candy and wrapping paper and all that kind of stuff and our sales are anywhere from $25000 to $40000 and so we get half of that for the profit and i do that sale myself but that also means that i have thousands and thousands of dollars to sort through and reconcile but anyhow i am always saying when it slows down but then i always will find another project and i rehab houses whenever i get a chance i like to do that 

Recording: (316/ 9621) 
hmm 

Recording: (317/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (318/ 9621) 
okay is it like a kind of snobbish or are they 

Recording: (319/ 9621) 
i am not really a big fan i think one of the big problems is gonna be initially just the monetary thing of it the people that supported the basically supported the minor league teams that they had here like blue collar people you can go for 20 30 bucks and have a good time get drunk throw a beer and up there you know you are not gonna be able to do that it is gonna cost you a minimum of 50 to $100 probably to take a family a couple kids or something like that you know 

Recording: (320/ 9621) 
or anything like that i mean that is something that i do not know i would sort of make known to them but not something that i would really push on them 

Recording: (321/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (322/ 9621) 
actually i that is what got me interested and so i went to library school and 

Recording: (323/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (324/ 9621) 
yeah he loves some chicken he loves chicken that is like his favorite food 

Recording: (325/ 9621) 
since i have been on both worlds 

Recording: (326/ 9621) 
it was not publicized to the degree that it is now it seems like any more nothing is sacred i mean as far as the papers are concerned and that is something else that i guess i am oldfashioned but i do not think we need all this publicity about all the sexual escapades of all the people that are notarized or have notarious lives i just i say maybe i am oldfashioned but i and i can hardly conceive anyone being a genuine homosexual i mean evidently they are but it is so against human nature i think or against conventional human nature anyway 

Recording: (327/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (328/ 9621) 
she helped a lot 

Recording: (329/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (330/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (331/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (332/ 9621) 
it is regular is enough for me in that and i did not have i could not schedule the honors 

Recording: (333/ 9621) 
we took or i took a military ethics as a philosophy course and that was really interesting because even though even in that hierarchy there is still certain contexts within the context of war for instance if we both know if we knowingly go into it as combatants and we are fighting for whatever cause but if we both are willingly going into it 

Recording: (334/ 9621) 
now every once in a while with my grandmother she always wanted me to become a nurse and i was a senior in high school when she died and sometimes i think boy she would really like it if i was a nurse because i still use her blood pressure cuff and everything she had given me her blood pressure cuff i mean it is very old 

Recording: (335/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (336/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (337/ 9621) 
yeah my grandmother is from ireland my grandmother and grandfather are both from ireland 

Recording: (338/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (339/ 9621) 
yeah but i mean a kid that might want to save up for something when he is 12 years old has no chance at all of getting a job 

Recording: (340/ 9621) 
mmm 

Recording: (341/ 9621) 
well that is the other thing a lot of times they are good in the arts they are either an artist i have a boy right now that is an eighth grader that is painting a huge canvas for me for my living room because i have not been able to find a picture so i brought in the picture and he is enlarging it and painting it for me in his free time and it is going to go in my living room and i mean he is really quite the artist and music arts literature acting i have had kids that have been like really topnotch actors in the school plays it is just not necessarily a school kind of thing that they are going to be good at but i try to explain to the parents that just because your child learns differently is no reason to think they will not be successful in life mark spitz won an olympic gold medal he has a learning disability cher bono can not remember a phone number without transposing two of the numbers she says that herself einstein did not learn to read until he was 12 winston churchill he stuttered until he was like 7 or 8 walt disney was told by a manager at woolworth is that he would never have a creative idea in his life 

Recording: (342/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (343/ 9621) 
i think it depends on the child and i think it depends on the adult as far as the supervision of it we are very strict as far as what games they have it is so wild when we were kids cowboy and indians everybody had guns if you had the best death act you were the best and nowadays oh do not let him have a gun you know do not let him play with you know even a squirt gun you know and so you wonder whether it is over exaggerated or you know none of us grew up shooting people or this you know we do not own any firearms but we played with guns and played all these games so i just wonder whether this is really you know but society is a lot different now 

Recording: (344/ 9621) 
yeah they are going to most likely raise it up to 21 since all these uh the kentucky and maryland colorado all those schools shootings and i can not believe man i mean there is articles in there you would not even believe if you have not read them 

Recording: (345/ 9621) 
most my friends 

Recording: (346/ 9621) 
and they should and very rarely do doctors even ask about allergies and more and more and people do not even realize and they get sick so often they need to ask about allergies or even just have a little minor test that they can take when people when they can not figure out what is wrong with them because a lot of times it is allergic reactions to things they have eaten 

Recording: (347/ 9621) 
so is there a large american population yeah it is like cosmopolitan but sometimes you just want to hang out with your own so is there any problems just finding people from the states 

Recording: (348/ 9621) 
there were a lot of teammates that were cutting that much weight if not more they were pretty much doing it for the team 

Recording: (349/ 9621) 
yeah franklin county usually votes differently than the rest of at least the metropolitan areas of the state 

Recording: (350/ 9621) 
so i started work when i was 14 i have been working ever since i have been out of school since i was 16 so i was in the service i was in vietnam 

Recording: (351/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (352/ 9621) 
yeah and i do computer processing mostly what i you know i work from 10 at night until 8 in the morning so 

Recording: (353/ 9621) 
just really starting to get started and i mean somebody you have an md that is enough you know you want somebody who has computer skills as well that is 

Recording: (354/ 9621) 
yeah but i have never voted in the primary my son said that i need to but i am not real interested in voting in the primary 

Recording: (355/ 9621) 
and then there is the one that is like oh i wish i had two weeks off at christmas well i used to work at harding hospital as a teacher when i first went to worthington when i said i got another job i got a job working at harding hospital as the principal but i was also a teacher so i taught part of the day and i was also the administrator because they had a small school there for the kids that were in the adolescent unit and they were away from home and they had to go to school and get their credits somewhere so the doctors always used to we were on like each person would be on a team of these kids they would be assigned to these kids and you would go to your team meetings and the doctors the shrinks would go well mitch i got two weeks off at christmas you know they would be bitching and moaning about the fact that we got time off and they did not and i finally came up with the perfect thing one time i said well dr simpson or whatever his name was dr brown you know how it is some of us went for the big bucks and some of us went for the time off 

Recording: (356/ 9621) 
aids being one of them 

Recording: (357/ 9621) 
that is the optimism yeah ok i have now dover and ferry what else do i need to remember 

Recording: (358/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (359/ 9621) 
so that is mainly probably more for fishing 

Recording: (360/ 9621) 
do i think they will oh yes i think they definitely will i think there is so much heavy political and financial well i am going to reverse that statement there is so much heavy financial influence upon the political influence that it is almost a foregone conclusion and if it does not occur within this year and there may be another vote in another year or next election but i think that in fact it will go 

Recording: (361/ 9621) 
sometimes she and mary had more disagreements than i ever had with her 

Recording: (362/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (363/ 9621) 
well the humans have started it and the man narrating the thing said there was not a single animal that they profiled in the thing that behaved the way it did on its own accord 

Recording: (364/ 9621) 
yeah i think it is of course we were fiddling with that so much 

Recording: (365/ 9621) 
no i do not want them to get together i love the tension if they get together it is dead whenever they get a i mean there are like five or six examples where it looks like they are going to hook up i mean that one where there was like a the duplicate molder 

Recording: (366/ 9621) 
um actually i think it needs to probably start younger than that 

Recording: (367/ 9621) 
well honestly growing up we did not have it was not really called sex ed they talked about the female reproductive system nothing about men which is kind of funny it was always the women in that chart 

Recording: (368/ 9621) 
she said you know what they say now and i raised my hand and said sixth she said fourth 

Recording: (369/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (370/ 9621) 
it makes me angry that people like that even get money 

Recording: (371/ 9621) 
wow 

Recording: (372/ 9621) 
definitely 

Recording: (373/ 9621) 
so i was shut out of the job market then that did not bother me i thought well fine that is when i got the job at channel 4 but it is like anything else some blacks use it for good some blacks use it for bad 

Recording: (374/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (375/ 9621) 
this means i get to hear more of my book 

Recording: (376/ 9621) 
and i go the same cake at meijer would have been like $7 or something like that but i do not try to be the cheapskate i mean i will not go without health plan or anything like that but there are certain like my car i love cars and you take the car to car wash it is like $750 or $8 and you wash in the driveway and it is about a quarter it is like it takes time if you have no time and i have friends at work that their mom is a taxi cab driver and the dad is the worker bee and when they get home they do not want to do anything so they pay to have the yard done they do this da da da da and it is like they have then they always go we have no money and it is like because you pay to do everything you know slow your life down a little bit you know it is like you making your soup you know when if and when you have children when they get my age they are going to go i can remember walking around the house and going mama is making bean soup or mama is making vegetable soup or mom baked a cake it is like as opposed to open it up oh here is a meyer cake 

Recording: (377/ 9621) 
that is alright 

Recording: (378/ 9621) 
and they are less hyper about like you know bad things for people to do you know the drinking the smoking they are just not as strict about it basically 

Recording: (379/ 9621) 
and like i say i do not believe that homosexuality is taught i think the kid will grow up and discover girls and be just fine 

Recording: (380/ 9621) 
well we put all kinds of information out on our own website which there is so much it is very hard to find what you want that is a constant problem with information is the more you put out there the harder it is to find what you want but if you can not get to it if it is not out there you can not find it it is a problem for us and for libraries because there is just a barrage of what they are getting and it is not just from us it is from the literature there is literally hundreds of library publications and it is a problem that librarians are facing all the time they can not keep up 

Recording: (381/ 9621) 
and i was raised here most of my life 

Recording: (382/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (383/ 9621) 
i am drifting 

Recording: (384/ 9621) 
hehehehe 

Recording: (385/ 9621) 
so they got us kids vaccinated in time but dad did not 

Recording: (386/ 9621) 
no ands ifs or buts you go to jail for three years 

Recording: (387/ 9621) 
eh 

Recording: (388/ 9621) 
the other one just fit in really well 

Recording: (389/ 9621) 
a little bit yeah 

Recording: (390/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (391/ 9621) 
that is perfect 

Recording: (392/ 9621) 
they what they 

Recording: (393/ 9621) 
i have not been paying a lot of attention to it just because 

Recording: (394/ 9621) 
so embarrassed i am so sorry and the guy is like eh nobody else is eating it she might as well 

Recording: (395/ 9621) 
which was see with those guns of ours we figured within 10 yards was a hit and because if you had one of those things 37 pounds of tnt go off within 10 yards of it 

Recording: (396/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (397/ 9621) 
right now he is really interested in eastern religions i am not sure where that came from you know when they go to college and they are gone and you do not see him much that is what he is interested in right now so i do not think it really took 

Recording: (398/ 9621) 
well he told a jewish friend of mine that her grandparents that died in the holocaust went to hell because they were jewish 

Recording: (399/ 9621) 
is that right 

Recording: (400/ 9621) 
because i have seen more violence on alcohol i have seen more women beat i have seen more kids beat i have seen more drunk in driving racks 

Recording: (401/ 9621) 
i am sorry 

Recording: (402/ 9621) 
and their needs were immediate 

Recording: (403/ 9621) 
so i just see a pattern you know i just feel like this is going to happen to me eventually 

Recording: (404/ 9621) 
i was going to say i have seen situations too where i can see their side of it as well because the mothers are used to or the wives are used to being home and the husbands support them and in those situations they still want them to they still do not want to go out there and do that and um and you know they need to look at each one of those cases too cause i know there is alimony and all that kind of thing and that can be detrimental to the man cause he can never go out and have another life or have another wife and you know 

Recording: (405/ 9621) 
oh really where are you from 

Recording: (406/ 9621) 
i think the fact that things like responsibility maybe a long time ago people stayed married because they felt like they had a responsibility to take care of their family i mean and you can be divorced and still take care of your family instead of you know things as far as people getting pregnant and then this person goes off and leaves and you have got a lot of unmarried single women that are all by themselves it is more socially acceptable to be able to do these things now than i think it was a long time ago people is families would never stand for something like that they would say look you need to take care of this you need to deal with this now it is just kind of normal and everybody just kind of goes along with it 

Recording: (407/ 9621) 
all the kids in the world all that will happen through that that influenced all the kids 

Recording: (408/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (409/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (410/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (411/ 9621) 
mmhmm yeah it is either gonna be find the house we want or we will go build it somewhere 

Recording: (412/ 9621) 
yeah i think they do 

Recording: (413/ 9621) 
not that i have seen you know 

Recording: (414/ 9621) 
well the charge was cutting class yeah and what it was i was supposed to meet my mom outside i told my teacher i brought a note and got an excuse slip and all that i went down to my locker before and the teacher we called her the general because she would always be out there watching you not a teacher but an administrator excuse me and she was out there and she saw me in my locker and what are you doing down here in the whole 30 minute conversation that could have only lasted five minutes with thank you okay here is my slip she thought i forged the slip 

Recording: (415/ 9621) 
bye 

Recording: (416/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (417/ 9621) 
i am an independent 

Recording: (418/ 9621) 
and trying to stop it i am trying to think of some good examples i mean when politicians start talking about biological functions 

Recording: (419/ 9621) 
yeah it is a tour it is a package tour you have rome florence venice pisa it does not interest me 

Recording: (420/ 9621) 
exactly yeah 

Recording: (421/ 9621) 
it was a law enforcement career center and i mean 

Recording: (422/ 9621) 
well it is sort of like the sociology of like clicks you know like how how that develops like how people like some people seek to like fit in like like that is a real strong like 

Recording: (423/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (424/ 9621) 
and how are you and i know like one point in time it is like we do not want to hang out with you crystal i am like well fine i do not care i will go hang out with them it is like they they still need to do a lot of growing up 

Recording: (425/ 9621) 
yeah the near west side has always been a pretty bad area well in the last 40 or 50 years and it is starting to creep west 

Recording: (426/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (427/ 9621) 
yeah that is true well we went osu is they have got a nice facility i mean they have a labor and delivery room it is weird though because when you go they show you they talk about all this whirlpool bath thing i do not know if you have heard those commercials or not but there is only one room that is like that 

Recording: (428/ 9621) 
and that is really an important issue right now i saw that the first time in 1992 because i have not said it yet but anyone listening to this tape you would be able to know i am a democrat and generally vote democratic although i will tell you i did vote for greg lashucka once and if he had run again i would have voted for him because i like his style and he has not been bad for the city but i am generally a democrat and i have only voted for two people who won the presidential election and i knew in 92 early on that clinton was going to win just by being out with people and i was at a restaurant one time with my girlfriend and a waiter came up and he said something about you know and i can not remember how we got started on the topic you know just taking my order for a restaurant but he said something about dole was too old and this was a young guy he was in college and i knew there was a sort of a shift people wanted someone with younger ideas and a new vision they did not want the world war ii vision anymore and i thought that was kind of interesting because by and large young people also supported reagan and i thought do they really understand the difference in issues and what the two stand for but it was that reagan appeared young and charismatic and so did clinton so i think for the average voter that does have a lot of sway 

Recording: (429/ 9621) 
oh the festivals in the summer that they have downtown i mean those are really great and they are crowded but they are peaceful there is not rioting in the streets and there is a lot to do and great music 

Recording: (430/ 9621) 
really and it is a fun job it really is i have only ever known one male that taught first grade and i knew one guy that taught third most of the time if they go into elementary ed they go for the upper grades like four five or six but i really think that if we let the boys be more exposed to men earlier then they would be more motivated to learn because they would see that it is not just a girly thing they would say oh well mr soandso thinks it is important that i know this and he is a real macho guy so i better learn it you know i do i really do nowadays with the pay being better we are getting more men 

Recording: (431/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (432/ 9621) 
exactly 

Recording: (433/ 9621) 
well according to government she would have 

Recording: (434/ 9621) 
right right you know 

Recording: (435/ 9621) 
we have not talked about adopting the baby but at our age 

Recording: (436/ 9621) 
jerry who was not jerry springer or jerry somebody that is on there and he has 

Recording: (437/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (438/ 9621) 
oh let us see i have already told you more than i ever told anybody else i think 

Recording: (439/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (440/ 9621) 
but i 

Recording: (441/ 9621) 
they just she was drinking i mean terrible alcoholic and very his father was very abusive and they were not even married 

Recording: (442/ 9621) 
right yeah well my oldest daughter is the biggest cheapskate i keep asking her when i call her on the phone or i email her every day i said are you out of money she goes well i have like $3 but i am not going to the bank machine because you are picking me up tuesday and i am not paying a $2 service charge to get money out i will wait till i get home and i am like i can not complain 

Recording: (443/ 9621) 
there is a feeble attempt to make you wellrounded is what there is but there is no specific language class 

Recording: (444/ 9621) 
i am 

Recording: (445/ 9621) 
you understand what i mean 

Recording: (446/ 9621) 
no no she has to do it it is chaos up there it is chaos i mean they had somebody come in to oversee the whole setup to see where they needed more help at whether they needed more nurses and the guy told her the person that was in charge the head nurse or whatever there is no way that person can do that job they still do it so when you are in charge it is just a nightmare you are supposed to know where every single patient is where they are charged what is going on what room they are in you are just walking around like a crazy person all day 

Recording: (447/ 9621) 
yes i do 

Recording: (448/ 9621) 
like sitting out on the street all the time honking the horns ringing the bells doing the whistles the really annoying chants i had classes in the bnz building that we just had to cancel because they were too loud 

Recording: (449/ 9621) 
doing the dumbing down of schools 

Recording: (450/ 9621) 
i am surprised myself you know they would not say who the guy was that interviewed but i do not think that probably that hard to figure out you know they are 

Recording: (451/ 9621) 
did not get vaccinated in time and he was just covered with those sores for i do not know how long mom said that after they started after the scabs started falling off of him he would get out of the bed and she would take the sheet out in the yard and shake it to get those scabs off 

Recording: (452/ 9621) 
to be close so i did not have to drive 

Recording: (453/ 9621) 
now you will hear me way too much 

Recording: (454/ 9621) 
well that is what they have done well they have done that here too they have done it at every university 

Recording: (455/ 9621) 
and that is a problem in our society and if something can come out of the university here to promote the reverse of that i think you have a lot less psychological problems with people and domestic problems work problems everything because the problem comes down to the fact well gee it is not recognized whatever these trends in our society well you gotta be a computer guru before gates was recognized he was nothing 

Recording: (456/ 9621) 
with my mother 

Recording: (457/ 9621) 
oh yeah yeah you work really hard while you are at it and then when you are done you are done 

Recording: (458/ 9621) 
i would think it would be cheaper organic food 

Recording: (459/ 9621) 
no my husband yeah he is from she can wear a bandana but that is it and you know i would love to do that with her only on things like that i would not be the type that would put a sweater on her on tuesday and a little skirt on her on wednesday but i would get a kick out of that 

Recording: (460/ 9621) 
and i did not do that myself but we had a couple of boys in the outfit who could find where we were on a map and where our op our observation post was and where the enemy out here was and all that and it was interesting calculating trying to calculate where your shells were going to land out there 

Recording: (461/ 9621) 
mhm 

Recording: (462/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (463/ 9621) 
different 

Recording: (464/ 9621) 
the bonding 

Recording: (465/ 9621) 
of course i am gonna get stopped for suspicious person everywhere i go 

Recording: (466/ 9621) 
leaving out stuff man 

Recording: (467/ 9621)

Recording: (468/ 9621) 
i mean i do not think they should get rid of it for polaris thing but you know there is plenty of malls to go to if that is the case it is not a big deal to me to tell you the truth no actually i live closer i live east more 

Recording: (469/ 9621) 
is that right i just love those koala bears just to see a koala bear i would go they are just like little teddy bears bring one home to your daughter say here is a little playmate here is a baby brother for you really do they oh they look so sweet and cuddly you know just like something you just want to take home really what do they eat 

Recording: (470/ 9621) 
well my son started in public school for kindergarten and he just my son is my son is a very social child we will say he is the one that talks too much as the teachers say he is a social child he talks too much he likes to get up and run around and he needs something very structured he needs the time to run around but he needs something very structured you get him near a bunch of other kids when he was little and it was like he would just run and scream at them because he was ready to play well yeah and my daughter is the opposite of that but he would do that and so he was not learning things and he was constantly getting in trouble and it is like i do not know we would be told he was very frightened he was not learning things and he was constantly getting in trouble we would be told he was a problem but he did not understand what was going on if there was not a structure he would go to school every day and not know what to expect because it was not like we will do this and then we will do this and we will do this so we checked out the catholic school and they were organized that way and it just was a better match for him and then when my daughter went to school it was just easier to take him to the same school and that goes back to reminding me of another thing i wanted to say about why the discipline and behavior may be different in the catholic school is you are paying bucks it is $4500 a year for us to send her to school and if we find out she is not doing her work it is a very different perspective 

Recording: (471/ 9621) 
is really opposing my belief so i stand there and pretty much spar with them about it and he usually ends up getting frustrated and tells me to leave 

Recording: (472/ 9621) 
is it oh that is a good day 

Recording: (473/ 9621) 
yes for attention and yeah 

Recording: (474/ 9621) 
i think the divorce rate has gone up because it is more socially acceptable i am sure there is plenty of people 20 years ago that would have loved to have gotten a divorce had that been an option i think a lot of it just depends on the way you handle it how you handle it after the divorce is final does that make any sense at all 

Recording: (475/ 9621) 
i do not see how we can say i mean we can refuse to see certain classes of movies or watch certain classes of shows but without getting into that first amendment thing i do not know i have never seen it happen in my lifetime so i do not know if it could be but then of course it can not go on the same way forever i can not keep progressing i do not think 

Recording: (476/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (477/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (478/ 9621) 
and 

Recording: (479/ 9621) 
essentially dying and so we were dealing with all of this at the same time i mean there was one night i remember we were ready to leave the hospital about 730 we checked to see if there was any messages at home to see if we would heard from him and got a message that my motherinlaw had fallen and she was in an emergency room the same hospital fortunately so we went down there then on the way home got a phone call on the cell phone from the hospital that my fatherinlaw had had some bleeding so we had to go back to the hospital and then we went around driving around looking for my son and this was not unusual it was a horrible period and i think what made my wife and i the angriest was that he is the only one that really could control his behavior the others could not 

Recording: (480/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (481/ 9621) 
that is not a shocking surprise i mean i rarely get a kid for math although we do have kids that are learning disabled and they do not understand math either even though it is very concrete 

Recording: (482/ 9621) 
government does not seem to work too swiftly 

Recording: (483/ 9621) 
yeah it is a really disciplined school but it is a lot of rebellion at the same time 

Recording: (484/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (485/ 9621) 
sometimes i think that it is just like math sucks and it is like 

Recording: (486/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (487/ 9621) 
exactly huge 

Recording: (488/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (489/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (490/ 9621) 
it is just major things that you have to do that are a lot more time consuming 

Recording: (491/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (492/ 9621) 
well i should tell them that they should love themselves the girls should both of them should love their bodies and not give it to a boy that is falling all over you and you feel all good and this and that you should respect yourself and love your body and do not give yourself to somebody just because you are feeling good and the boys i should the boys need to calm down i mean i do not know 

Recording: (493/ 9621) 
she has trouble driving even at night and stuff like that 

Recording: (494/ 9621) 
xcs there are a few people that i know that use it 

Recording: (495/ 9621) 
on the issues but i think it does mean a lot to other people so i can not really answer that question how they would have voted because i did not think that mike coleman exactly had charisma either 

Recording: (496/ 9621) 
oh my 

Recording: (497/ 9621) 
we are buying it yeah and we should have paid off about five years then we are talking about moving someplace a little simpler to take care of 

Recording: (498/ 9621) 
uh i think uh i think uh high school and i like that people are so very soon the standards you know for a for high school things but uh i think uh it is kind of like it is really hard to like i thought about for just what is wrong with the education system in general and i think it is more of a college is a little bit different i guess but it is more of like this whole like the teacher is talking and the information goes from the teacher is mouth to the student is notes without going through either of their brains it is just blah about you know just like it is it is it is real structured but it is real hard to think about what to do to change that it is kind of like more like i do not know i mean i had really good like there was a couple of really good teachers like my history teachers and english teachers were really good 

Recording: (499/ 9621) 
was she where is she from latin america 

Recording: (500/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (501/ 9621) 
you see 

Recording: (502/ 9621) 
and the problem is as a youngster as you grow up you do not realize how much your parents did for you until you are probably about 35 40 you do not realize my goodness mom dad you made a sacrifice because now i am learning a little more what you did and then by the time you are maybe 60 50 60 now you got to take care of your parents if you had the morals to do it otherwise you just ship them off to the farm 

Recording: (503/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (504/ 9621) 
the three rs you know i think those are still very important 

Recording: (505/ 9621) 
they were actually able to select a couple they talked to a lawyer who arranges the options and she had a file and they through a bunch of questions and answers type thing were able to limit them to three couples and they liked the first couple they met 

Recording: (506/ 9621) 
along with what my father thinks and says and if he wants it a certain way why you just do not question that and i just do not do that it is wrong 

Recording: (507/ 9621) 
definitely 

Recording: (508/ 9621) 
yeah because i do not have a degree 

Recording: (509/ 9621) 
and a lot of it was the bitterness of the divorce 

Recording: (510/ 9621) 
mhm 

Recording: (511/ 9621) 
et à y croire 

Recording: (512/ 9621) 
they do not do it today unless the person is a scholar i mean a 38 rhodes scholar hey okay 

Recording: (513/ 9621) 
so it is been very difficult for us particularly the last four years and about the time he ran away was between the time my fatherinlaw died and my motherinlaw died which was in a fivemonth period so my wife is had a lot to deal with and she is had a lot to deal with in that time 

Recording: (514/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (515/ 9621) 
just 

Recording: (516/ 9621) 
right the hardest both the hardest and easiest thing i think i have ever done was knowing when it was time to take him to the vet to have him euthanized 

Recording: (517/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (518/ 9621) 
no i would not have 

Recording: (519/ 9621) 
getting them someplace stable 

Recording: (520/ 9621) 
i think it is the right position to take but like abortion that is one of the big issues that divide people very quickly i think it is moderating somewhat as the gay activists continue their campaigns but that is one where a candidate has to tread very carefully i was proud that coleman said it and did not back down on that they told me a little bit about his character i do not know that i can answer your question straightforward because i believe in gay rights i believe in anybody is rights what happens between consenting adults in a bedroom is their business not mine 

Recording: (521/ 9621) 
yeah it was five weeks early delivering so it was really unplanned as far as when we were expecting it 

Recording: (522/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (523/ 9621) 
i do not know that much about it to be quite honest i did read about it in the paper and i know the whole thing with chief jackson and the whole mayoral candidates how they are getting debates over that and i know this is something new on top of that i know it was the front page on sunday is paper i looked at it briefly i think there must be some truth to it i do not know the extent 

Recording: (524/ 9621) 
well i would say in springfield yeah 

Recording: (525/ 9621) 
right right i think there is so many small communities like even though osu has really obviously its own little community and then you have got you know dublin and they have got their own parades and their own different things so i agree i mean i think that there really is a lot of things to do in that own individual area that i can not see somebody from dublin going over to the west side to do anything you know what i do not and maybe also i feel safer where i live too and that is something that is an issue for me i know when i do travel down cleveland avenue it does it makes me nervous so i just kind of stay away from that 

Recording: (526/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (527/ 9621) 
i was 48 when i retired it is great it is terrific 

Recording: (528/ 9621) 
now well it is like you buy it and then you get to do the shopping the fun part you go out and pick out wallpaper and cabinets and all this and that and then you have somebody else do that part but i do not do like major gutting or anything i just like to get something that needs that i can have a vision i can usually see this can be really fabulous if you take care of this bathroom and kitchen and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah so that is the kind of stuff and i have only done three or four of them but it is fun 

Recording: (529/ 9621) 
well i think the price has a lot to do with it because i mean that is what i see over there that prevents it you know they are a sort of middle of the line dress that would be like at the limited here or something is you know 75 pounds you know like a dollar 65 or whatever conversion i mean that is a lot you know you see them in limited and you think whatever the price is think whatever the price is expensive but really if you buy that you are not really gonna be buying more than one or anything else for a while i think i mean here there is that sort of like he has the most wins or whatever that phrase is and there is that with cds and stuff is cheap people buy so much of it like portions are so big because the restaurants can get it more cheaply i mean there you know the portions are a lot smaller it is more expensive you just eat less and i mean you just see it contributing to everything i mean the obesity problem here and everything else i mean it is getting worse there than it was but i mean it is nowhere is it anywhere near and that is a large part of the problem with that people were constantly on me about oh why are americans so fat and all these things on the television about the americans and i mean that was never ending 

Recording: (530/ 9621) 
mwah 

Recording: (531/ 9621) 
i get a job at hyde park it is amazing because the money is so good you can not beat it i only have to work three or four nights a week and it leaves my whole day free for classes hyde park grill is a restaurant in dublin i did that all through high school and college after i graduated from high school i managed a restaurant for about a year and a half 

Recording: (532/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (533/ 9621) 
i look like a college student that would go here so i have never had a problem so we go and do that and we are planning a road trip we have not decided we are thinking atlantic city or florida or new york city or new orleans those are the choices and we are trying to narrow it down 

Recording: (534/ 9621) 
it has to be a longstanding kind of thing yeah you know and that worries me more than i understand a lot of the objection is because this is just this is opening the door a crack and the next thing you know you know one legal step leads to another legal step and then we will have gay marriage and all those things but i do not think that would be a bad thing either 

Recording: (535/ 9621) 
i do not remember that at all i know how to do it but i am not sure who taught me how to do it 

Recording: (536/ 9621) 
mmmm right 

Recording: (537/ 9621) 
mhm 

Recording: (538/ 9621) 
i am not 

Recording: (539/ 9621)

now 

Recording: (555/ 9621) 
is there anything else you need to know or

Recording: (557/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (558/ 9621) 
well if you want something local that is all you can got i mean there is one paper

Recording: (561/ 9621)

Recording: (566/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (567/ 9621)

Recording: (568/ 9621) 
oh yeah you can not get them off 

Recording: (569/ 9621) 
because i have a real good sense of how things have to be see my husband and i are very different we are very different but we are really lucky we have a fabulous relationship and he is real grateful and appreciative and you said as long as he appreciates you now he will come home and say 

Recording: (570/ 9621)

Recording: (572/ 9621) 
now 

Recording: (573/ 9621)

Recording: (575/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (576/ 9621) 
we won we were victorious we did not won you know 

Recording: (577/ 9621) 
no it was kind of disturbing actually 

Recording: (578/ 9621) 
then obviously the civilization is going to be dead 

Recording: (579/ 9621) 
he is white just a real down just look like he is from the ghetto just nasty guy 

Recording: (580/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (581/ 9621) 
yeah right if you are lucky but i mean there is the person that says that and then there is the other person that says well i sure admire what you do and i would not be a teacher for anything in this world you know the one that is just in awe of you 

Recording: (582/ 9621) 
so i should really realize this parking situation but like i said i usually walk and today i do not really feel like it i am having a baby in about two weeks here really ready to get this over with 

Recording: (583/ 9621) 
oh really 

Recording: (584/ 9621) 
right well when i was taking teacher education classes here and observing classroom teachers they would always tell me you need to give a grade for class participation 

Recording: (585/ 9621) 
northern mall hosts the battle of the bands once a month 

Recording: (586/ 9621) 
ha ha ha 

Recording: (587/ 9621) 
you can not no 

Recording: (588/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (589/ 9621) 
yeah and the bendy board 

Recording: (590/ 9621) 
well as i told my daughter when she came on i said you know religion is a business she said oh no dad it is not religion i said it sure is a business i said it is just the superficial things the packages are attractive to you 

Recording: (591/ 9621) 
they used to grow wild when i was a kid 

Recording: (592/ 9621) 
so that is where he is always parked 

Recording: (593/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (594/ 9621) 
and i saw one of my friends had to work so hard to get into mit 

Recording: (595/ 9621) 
oh it is some committee i mean you have to send them in to someplace at the state of ohio 

Recording: (596/ 9621) 
so it is pretty much regular like just a western wedding where they throw the rice 

Recording: (597/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (598/ 9621) 
right and also the other thing is you have to be sort of compassionate because you are working a lot of airplanes and you are wanting answers like this when you spit something out you want an answer each airplane is supposed to respond with their call sign like if i tell somebody turn left heading 360 and he is supposed to respond twa 396 roger well if he does not respond then i have got to say it again which means instead of 10 airplanes i now have 11 i am talking to because i have to talk to him two times each there are some people that get really mad quick because they want that answer like that i was a pilot so sometimes i am thinking 

Recording: (599/ 9621) 
which was 57 cents an hour 

Recording: (600/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (601/ 9621)

Recording: (603/ 9621) 
yeah i had about three or four friends that were actually gay 

Recording: (604/ 9621) 
and so you had 

Recording: (605/ 9621) 
i can not say that really bothered me like i said it is something that is his choice his opinion and whatnot i mean it is up to him it does not affect the nation any or anything like that i mean he is still as long as he is making the right decisions or whatever then 

Recording: (606/ 9621) 
but basically i went back in operations because it is not the money i like the job 

Recording: (607/ 9621) 
yeah we do office parties and everything like yesterday we had to go to an attorney is firm and just fruit and cookies people tend to have food more and more you can not believe gourmet lunches and things a lot more than they did let us say 10 years ago 

Recording: (608/ 9621) 
oh and the city 

Recording: (609/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (610/ 9621)

Recording: (615/ 9621) 
and 

Recording: (616/ 9621) 
what did you do did you do the tourist thing 

Recording: (617/ 9621) 
so i guess what can i do 

Recording: (618/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (619/ 9621) 
and if i continue to do that for a long period of time i become very unpopular 

Recording: (620/ 9621) 
my parents homesteaded out there in 1911 or 12 shortly after they were married 

Recording: (621/ 9621) 
i walked out and it was not quietly and i walked out but it felt good and i did not even know if i was gonna be living in the streets but i will never forget the day you know and his wife worked in the office too so i went to her and i said it was nice working with you i am going home you know you can reach me at home and then he was shocked and he just could not believe it and he said you can not do this he says i will not pay you and i said you me walk out the door and i do not want any money so i left out oh it was just a long drawn out thing i mean it started out with little things and then it just got bigger like he had an office off of the main office and it was a pretty prominent insurance company and he had his own agency and he was a successful i mean he probably still is out there very successful but i was doing some computer training and he was walking me to the other side of the building and he locked the door and turned around he said why do not you get the front door and it was only he and i in the office and every once in a while his wife would be in there and i just i lost it i was mad but i did not want him to think that i was afraid i wanted him to be afraid of me so i just i stomped back to my desk and i said oh great i said not only are you a pain to work with i have to be afraid of you and then i think i did scare him because he backed off a lot and his and then that that was a real slap in the face for him so he was really mean after that so i left i just i walked out i picked the kids up at the bus stop and they are like mommy what are you doing i said we are going somewhere let is get in the car so but yeah just a couple of experiences like that though will make you do other things so you know i stayed tough and i you know got other jobs and 

Recording: (622/ 9621) 
i mean we had goals certain things that like we had a set where we would like to do four hours of service every week 

Recording: (623/ 9621) 
through the women is group and 

Recording: (624/ 9621) 
and we had like tapes we listened to with native speakers so you got really good really quick 

Recording: (625/ 9621) 
right my husband drops them off and i pick them up so he is there for the shortest amount of time 

Recording: (626/ 9621) 
and i guess it worked for them 

Recording: (627/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (628/ 9621) 
i do not even know what to say what a disgrace it is just embarrassing it really is 

Recording: (629/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (630/ 9621) 
are they friendlier than the koalas 

Recording: (631/ 9621) 
my mom never had an upper girl jay is mom never had an upper girl you know and that looks worse to me did you see that it takes 20 minutes they thread this thing this needle in your back they put this that sounds worse to me than even having a baby i just can not i do not really think of my back so i guess it is true you just have to wait and see when she get there what happens 

Recording: (632/ 9621) 
what do i want out of life 

Recording: (633/ 9621) 
especially when we try to sleep at five in the morning 

Recording: (634/ 9621) 
that was your youth and that is good 

Recording: (635/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (636/ 9621) 
getting electrocuted or something yeah that just does not appeal to me too much but i mean it is really not too difficult i mean as long as you are careful and 

Recording: (637/ 9621) 
that is right straight 40 kids but it is true my mom really has worked with them to make sure that they get into some programs that they need and there are some things now i think that they are developing that they did not have before 

Recording: (638/ 9621) 
they use drugs but not to the extreme that college students do 

Recording: (639/ 9621) 
do you you do that do you 

Recording: (640/ 9621) 
great 

Recording: (641/ 9621) 
well i play actually in two orchestras in the symphony and in the orchestra which is an all amateur group but it is actually there were times when i was i have been in that group for maybe seven or eight years now and there have been times when i have been in that group that i have thought it had a really wretched sound because they do not have auditions they just take anybody that wants to play and if you take a string player that can not play in tune it can really wreck everything yeah but i think we have improved a lot we gave a concert a couple weeks ago at a church in upper arlington and i thought it went pretty well win peace a little bit of mozart some concertos so that was fun yeah 

Recording: (642/ 9621) 
that would just send me into the new millennium or whatever you want to call it 

Recording: (643/ 9621) 
i have worked in pm gallery in the short north

and so they went up there but the germans caught on pretty quick and they made it pretty hot and that area of enzio was just flat as this table almost for an area back from the mediterranean back probably 10 miles and it was 10 or 12 miles long the coast long and so we had enough area to manipulate in and it was crisscrossed with deep ditches of some kind i do not know whether they were irrigation ditches or what which we used as fortifications

answered an ad in the paper but i have sung in well sean sings in the symphony chorus too i have sung in it for 16 years 

Recording: (673/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (674/ 9621) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (675/ 9621) 
yeah i just renewed my certificate last year so i may get back into it part of the reason i renewed my certificate was i did some home instruction with the columbus public schools last year and that is kind of like a tutoring job where you can go you can arrange hours with a student that is at home for some reason i had one that just had a baby and it is an interesting job because they look for somebody that can cover the most technical i guess subject that the student is taking in my case it turned out to be chemistry and one i think chemistry once and it was algebra two another time but they expected us to at least they expected me to cover the other subjects too or at least to spend a little bit of time on them so there was english and there was history so it really requires you to be wellrounded and i like kind of like that i have taught in a couple of other places community colleges the college in newark i taught a chemistry class there and the community college which is in hillsboro but i taught at their branch and i taught an introduction to ecology class there and an introduction to the arts it was called and that was interesting it is kind of an underclass of teachers they do not pay you enough to do that they pay you per student contact hour and in my chemistry class i was teaching i think a total of five or six contact hours a week and they were paying something like $21 or $22 an hour 

Recording: (676/ 9621) 
but like to some people that is considered a city so i think it is your perspective in that sense 

Recording: (677/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (678/ 9621) 
okay it was kind of it was different when i because when i went in i mean i never had any problem with a black person or i do not really care you know as long as they did their job and everything i am basically the same way today 

Recording: (679/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (680/ 9621) 
that is not enough 

Recording: (681/ 9621) 
what they do they have up to four or five months the first four or five months of pregnancy they are allowed to maintain once they start to show they do not let them go to the school anymore just for the health of the baby 

Recording: (682/ 9621) 
mmhmm plus you get so many different students and well i like just walking over here today you know i just ca not thought you know i am under how many of these people i walked by you know we are gonna be here in january because you know i because i did you know i thought this is cool man you know 

Recording: (683/ 9621) 
yeah i really do not know i do not understand why they do not because to me it is the most important freedom we have and people bitch and complain all the time but then when you ask them if they voted they go no it makes no difference well it makes no difference if you do not because your voice was not heard when i was a political action consultant for the ohio education association i used to go around and try to get teachers involved in politics and one of the things i would tell them is that every vote is important john kennedy won if you would take all of the votes he won by and spread it out across the nation by one vote per precinct one vote per precinct you know if there had just been one additional vote either way in any of those precincts you know he would have lost and so one vote does count and i used to have a list of elections that were decided by one or two votes and when i was with the ohio education association i generally did school levy campaigns and many of them are decided by one two seven 18 19 votes if i knew the magic reason why people do not vote i could sell that and make a fortune but i do not know what it is 

Recording: (684/ 9621) 
yeah yeah because right now you know because he knows how to he is he is learned i would say he knows more than most kindergartners so i do not even push anything we do not really have a set schedule right now and i am just letting him be creative and you know letting him help around the house and you know just if i let him watch something it is educational based based usually and i let him play on the computer we will go to different websites sometimes to check out things and i am amazed sometimes at what he just catches on just from day to day stuff and just listening because he is he listens to everything 

Recording: (685/ 9621) 
yeah yeah but i have purposely tried to work close or do the back roads it is nice from hilliard you can get almost anywhere whether it be here or you know where i have been working on back roads so it is not that bad 

Recording: (686/ 9621) 
and he said even when he was in high school they had police officers there so that is not like a new thing but he said you would have people with knives and you would have people with fist fights but guns was unheard of and i think i do not know where this new trend is coming from i think maybe people feel dejected in high school i am sure of it i did not feel that way but in retrospect i look back and i thought i am thinking maybe those people really felt horrible and if every day was so traumatizing to them that would be for four years every day you are just teased or something horrible and no one talks to you i am not justifying what they do at all but i am saying that would make them more that would probably in their mind give them the reason 

Recording: (687/ 9621) 
he does not seem to have any problem it is always been whatever she wants i know so far it is worked out pretty well so i am sure in a situation like that things are going to come up but we will deal with it 

Recording: (688/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (689/ 9621) 
mmhmm yeah my mom are real close 

Recording: (690/ 9621) 
i do art fairs 

Recording: (691/ 9621) 
you know and it is just i think that that happens so often there is so many people or even that whole thing with bill clinton when you are talking circles around yourself but you never say anything 

Recording: (692/ 9621) 
yeah and i told them i was going to call up the tv station so they could film me crawling out the door as an osu employee 

Recording: (693/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (694/ 9621) 
i check my fax machine the next day it says my mother is decided to accept your offer and i thought oh shit i do not want this what am i going to do now so i ended up talking to him and i just explained to him that he had caught me off guard and that i would had more time to reconsider it and it is true because my daughter went to the doctor and the doctor had said at that point the baby could be here in two weeks and that it was just not going to work for me he was a nice man i felt bad and so then i gave him some ideas about how he could sell it 

Recording: (695/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (696/ 9621) 
alright 

Recording: (697/ 9621) 
well one thing you know being i came from basically a poor neighborhood poor lifestyle early life and everything you know so if anything i guess it kind of made me negative towards people that had influence and had money and did not do anything good with it you know i am a firm believer that if you got something that you should share it with other people i do not always practice what i preach but that would be a good philosophy to live by and people of other religions and everything i learned a lot about religion when i was raised baptist basically but i practice more catholic than anything else now but i am generally pretty knowledgeable about judaism and muslims and everything just because i find it interesting 

Recording: (698/ 9621) 
friend who her name was she is not really a friend she was a teacher when i was in college her name was mrs cozy and she got pregnant and she said everybody said she came in one day and said it is a girl it is a girl i found out it is a girl what are you going to name her rosie rosie cozy you have got to be kidding she is i am just putting you on 

Recording: (699/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (700/ 9621) 
i do not think it is really affected me i mean obviously there is more places to go shopping or to eat or there is more traffic which i do not particularly care much for but i do not think it was ever such a small town where it was like everybody knew each other and it felt like a small community i mean i know in my own neighborhood it was where you went to school with the people at least once i went to high school i went to public school 

Recording: (701/ 9621) 
what department 

Recording: (702/ 9621) 
and anymore you are lucky if you know your neighbors because everybody is so busy doing their own thing but as a world i think that everyone has become closer because of the communication that if you do not really actually speak to the people you are hearing about it on tv or radio or via telephone or whatever 

Recording: (703/ 9621) 
very very much so now 50 years ago 25 to 50 years ago we would tag that description rather than corporation we would tag that as socialism well in the manner we defined socialism 50 years ago we are a very very socialistic government today we are no longer a democratic government as defined back there then yeah we are still democratic according to our new definition that has developed over time but it is far more socialistic 

Recording: (704/ 9621) 
walks away 

Recording: (705/ 9621) 
like stay the heck out of my way here i come it is my world and welcome to it 

Recording: (706/ 9621) 
they did not like plot any weapon or anything like that it was just fistfight yeah 

Recording: (707/ 9621) 
oh okay 

Recording: (708/ 9621) 
it was part of that i started wrestling because a lot of my friends did 

Recording: (709/ 9621) 
it was a nice birthday party 

Recording: (710/ 9621) 
very new age 

Recording: (711/ 9621) 
i think it is the best thing in the world it is a wonderful neighborhood 

Recording: (712/ 9621) 
they do because he is all out for himself 

Recording: (713/ 9621) 
but of course whenever they needed a ride or anything like that they would come to me 

Recording: (714/ 9621) 
no kids just think oh it can not happen to me i am invincible 

Recording: (715/ 9621) 
hmm 

Recording: (716/ 9621) 
unit does it and it was not that i had a bad family unit it was just that there was not you know we never talked about it my sister and i were just talking about that because we were she goes we were like you know how did people start talking about sex and relationships and whatnot she goes you know mom and dad handed me a book i am like they did 

Recording: (717/ 9621) 
we were following his jeep we kept going and we kept going and this other gi and i were sitting in the back and i said hey suppose they know the german password but anyway we finally got out to where there was a bunch of ruined farmhouse and farm buildings and so on and i said well this is it so we there were some gis infantry men around there so we started looking around for a place to land i mean got our bedrolls out so on and the next morning i do not know i guess i was looking for somebody to light a fire to warm up some rice or something anyway one of the first guys i saw was a guy that had worked with my wife in the office there 

Recording: (718/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (719/ 9621) 
yeah he was lucky so 

Recording: (720/ 9621) 
well i think it was a nice thing about what we had we had grandparents that were not necessarily they were out of state in some cases we did not see them that much we made it a part that we communicated with the grandparents regularly and when we did it was a special time we emphasized the fact that kids want to do certain things okay they saw their mother go out and maybe do some additional things to work for that aspect we asked them if they wanted to go on a project with the class and so forth fine but you have got to participate in it too we will match you with what you come up with we made them part of the owner we gave them responsibilities they grew up with that aspect they learned by being around some older people which i think was good 

Recording: (721/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (722/ 9621) 
pretty much yeah easy come easy go follow the leader monkey in the middle whatever 

Recording: (723/ 9621) 
i mean i think that is the best way to address it and as far as the homosexual i think there is kids who say well maybe i am gay i do not know if i am gay or what well hopefully they will know their true identity eventually i mean yes some people i mean i know men several men who got married had children and then they decided they were gay okay were they gay before but they did like women 

Recording: (724/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (725/ 9621) 
i am currently unemployed 

Recording: (726/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (727/ 9621) 
you know because that will all go away about second grade 

Recording: (728/ 9621) 
no like i am a business major and i hear the business school here is pretty good so i wanted to take a look at that and my roommate is a business major so he was going to show me around the they have new buildings i guess so he said he would show me around there also i really do like i came down for a few games and things like that and i like the enthusiasm that people have for this place like ashland is so small there is a select group that has enthusiasm but nothing like here i mean this is ridiculous everyone is just enthusiastic about the university and even there might be things they do not like specifically about the university you do not hear any like universal negative things about the university ever 

Recording: (729/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (730/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (731/ 9621) 
but 

Recording: (732/ 9621) 
and it was just when drug culture was just starting we learned about it in school and stuff but no my parents never sat down with me or about smoking i mean i never really smoked but today with teenagers and everything so out in the open you have to talk to them about things and just say i want to help you and be there for them 100 obviously those parents were too busy with their own lives to realize what their children were doing so i think they are the ones to blame i do 

Recording: (733/ 9621) 
yeah that was pretty bad i think they i do not know what happened 

Recording: (734/ 9621) 
only the only can do it i mean it seems like with all the technology in the world they should be able to do something like that but people who have guns in their home and not have them locked up or in a you know in a place that no child could find it they are to blame they are they are to blame that whole thing with the school out in colorado i forget the name of it yeah but when they said that those boys were making those guns in the garage and the parents were clueless i just find that really hard to believe if a child goes into a garage every night and you hear clanging and they are buying gun metal then they were totally not in tune with what their kids were doing it is one thing them having a site on the internet 

Recording: (735/ 9621) 
i 

Recording: (736/ 9621) 
i have got plenty of people it is funny jason is mom asked me so is your mom gonna come and stay with you for a week i said no i told my mom she started laughing because i mean of course for her to come over and help out is terrific but if she actually stayed at my house for a week i think we would just kill each other 

Recording: (737/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (738/ 9621) 
yeah yeah it might be 

Recording: (739/ 9621) 
for parties so because it is actually a market it is all done outside like tonight we are going to the uh gobleth pavilion which is um it next to the hyatt theater it is really beautiful and people do a lot of parties there 

Recording: (740/ 9621) 
yeah it is real well it is like one of the closest bars and we go there because they have a huge patio and so you can just sit out and talk and then we play a lot of board games lately too like we just bought axis and allies me and my roommates 

Recording: (741/ 9621) 
well i grew up with just my mom she had four kids and i was very quiet and did very well in school 

Recording: (742/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (743/ 9621) 
credit card 

Recording: (744/ 9621) 
that is what you want 

Recording: (745/ 9621) 
so i just you know it was something i was a little familiar with anyway and i was just looking for something parttime 

Recording: (746/ 9621) 
i guess that would be a slightly different part i am not really sure how big of a problem that is in public schools but i mean one being the girl that did get pregnant she ended up going to public school the next year 

Recording: (747/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (748/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (749/ 9621) 
well no actually my mom did not she was a very bad cook 

Recording: (750/ 9621) 
man that hurt her to go she thought she was neglecting me 

Recording: (751/ 9621) 
plus i do not really feel like the republican party represents the populace at all like at their last political convention like in the last presidential election in 96 they said one in ten of the delegates that were attending the convention were millionaires now granted i know more than ten people and not you know what i mean so to me i just feel like that is not a good representation 

Recording: (752/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (753/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (754/ 9621) 
yeah so 

Recording: (755/ 9621) 
and because largely because of the fear of not knowing and not knowing how to deal with the unseen 

Recording: (756/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (757/ 9621) 
i mean dorothy teeter is obviously been around for a really long time and my views are typically a little bit more democratic but not to say that i certainly would not vote for the person that i thought would do the best job 

Recording: (758/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (759/ 9621) 
at this point i am not against the urban schools but if it was my own personal child i would move to a suburban area until columbus gets their act together they are in such bad shape right now that i do think the state will take over the columbus public schools in two years yeah they have threatened it and if they do not pull their scores up they will you know 

Recording: (760/ 9621) 
and i have got a couple in chicago and i have a couple in the washington area 

Recording: (761/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (762/ 9621) 
once they turn to adulthood and they feel like going out and shooting people or anything like that i do not think that has anything to do with it 

Recording: (763/ 9621) 
the runaways well i think the youngest that i met was maybe 12 but that is you know still young 

Recording: (764/ 9621) 
well you know because i have to think about how it went back into our income with everything else but i am sure that i did not pay more than $3000 on it and it did not cost me more than $3000 and so if i had $5000 or $6000 out of it i was happy 

Recording: (765/ 9621) 
i do not know that is kind of a tricky question really because on one hand obviously the kid definitely will get made fun of and teased and things like that 

Recording: (766/ 9621) 
well the thing is there is things you can not explain 

Recording: (767/ 9621) 
my sister is last name is goodnight and when she had her first little girl she said she was going to name her dawn ann goodnight but she did not she did not 

Recording: (768/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (769/ 9621) 
i had parents that everything i did was negative they just told me i could not do this could not do that so what i try to do is when anything comes up i always think of how my parents would handle it and i do 180 degrees i sort of feel i am mentally okay now but i do not know how i got here because i have been the other way 

Recording: (770/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (771/ 9621) 
well i think sometimes it is because the child has not ever been taught somehow or other or shown i have always been the kind of person to believe i never told my kids not to do something that i myself was doing example smoking cigarettes or taking a drink of beer or taking a wine with my dinner say no you are not old enough but i can now there are some things that the kids can not do at this age that somebody can not at another age possible i go out on a date for example well he is going on that party like an eye well he is already 16 years old now wait till you are 16 years old and you will be allowed to go to parties was by that time i will expect you to be able you know know what to do but i mean i never did and i know well i will not give you any examples but anyway if i told them they could not do it i would try swearing is one of my bad habits and i know that i would try very very hard i got taught one time that i better watch a little more carefully by my one little girl but anyway i would always and i would apologize if they did catch me doing something that i would been telling them no you cannot do i would apologize say mommy was bad and mommy did that i got soup on my mouth one time because well what no no i mean now if you want to hear the story and funny well dv just see but i was baking a pie and i was taking this pie out of the oven it was a cherry pie or an apple pie one of those that can get juicy sometimes and i hadn had not put any aluminum foil or anything to catch it and just as i started to get it out i spilled it and i said a bad word you know and just as i said that word leaning down here here is two little shoes of 

Recording: (772/ 9621) 
the same thing i think they are terrific for the right things 

Recording: (773/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (774/ 9621) 
freshman 

Recording: (775/ 9621) 
uh huh 

Recording: (776/ 9621) 
heaven forbid but i am sitting here going i mean i did not even know what i was doing 

Recording: (777/ 9621) 
we sat there then foroh and it was kind of funny we were goinganother guy and i and the lieutenant who was a forward observer were going out to a forward observation post and the observation lieutenant whatever his title was was guidinghe was in one jeep ahead of us and we were following him and of course we just had these little red blackout lights they called them 

Recording: (778/ 9621) 
she really likes it well yeah 

Recording: (779/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (780/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (781/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (782/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (783/ 9621) 
now 

Recording: (784/ 9621) 
and it is just the same as when i was a kid 

Recording: (785/ 9621) 
so what kind of doctor do you want to be i have got a few ideas i am thinking i might be an obgyn 

Recording: (786/ 9621) 
sitting back waiting 

Recording: (787/ 9621) 
and then but the whole band and the cheerleaders went to his house and he came out crying i mean it was on tv it was like heartwrenching 

Recording: (788/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (789/ 9621) 
et 

Recording: (790/ 9621) 
but they said all along they were gay they just fought it and they did not want the pressure from their families 

Recording: (791/ 9621) 
i think so i think so it is so sad to see a girl you know have so many options closed off i do not mean it by any stretch that it is a tragedy to have a baby but somebody in high school is making a lot of decisions she does not intend to make 

Recording: (792/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (793/ 9621) 
because again i said you get wisdom from that as long as you are listening to them some people i do not care what their age is they just blow them off so that plus you have the i think an understanding of the schooling they came from 

Recording: (794/ 9621) 
familiar with sarcom yes 

Recording: (795/ 9621) 
i do have some relatives that are step my stepmom is relatives that are there they are actually members of the mormon church 

Recording: (796/ 9621) 
yeah it is i mean you just know where it goes and you throw it in and there it is let is see what was my decoder card was a little more difficult i had somebody else do it for me 

Recording: (797/ 9621) 
oh good 

Recording: (798/ 9621)

Recording: (806/ 9621) 
gave me these leading questions i said ah i know where you are coming from i have been confronted with that when i was at ohio state and so forth and so i just laid it on the line to her 

Recording: (807/ 9621) 
i got on birth control probably when i was like 16 or 17 but still i did not take the pills all the time and that was not very good for me either 

Recording: (808/ 9621) 
it is like some of these places in florida kind of like ruined by tourists like fort lauderdale daytona it is like after the kids get done they just like well forget it it is like because i used to when i was in like a freshman i heard like do not even go to florida because they do not want students they want your money but they do not like the trash and whatnot that they bring 

Recording: (809/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (810/ 9621) 
depends on who the manager is at the time every manager is got a different agenda on what they want you to do 

Recording: (811/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (812/ 9621) 
i am not 

Recording: (813/ 9621) 
she sort of knows this is what she has to say at school if she is asked on a test because she needs the points for a grade 

Recording: (814/ 9621) 
the one girl had showed her ultrasound and then that is when it was like oh that is so cute and i am like well wait a minute i thought you was against it they are not always against it though 

Recording: (815/ 9621) 
you know we are right there within moments if there is a flood or something like that you call the contractor i will be in thursday if you are air conditioned so they are always gonna have to have people here so i just feel they are either better to downscale the amount of people they have and get highly qualified people than have 20 people that half of them know what is going on half of them do not but that is tough to do when you are starting people at $8 an hour and stuff so there is you know wendy is mcdonald is there is places that you can make that money so mmhmm my you know to me the thing that hurt me the most out of it is they want to put caps on our salaries so i am at the highest scale i can go right now as far as job title there is no other job i can move to unless i move into supervision or something up in there and i will be out of the union if i do that anyway so but they are gonna put a cap on that where you can only make so much money at a point which i am almost there right now i am only like 50 cents away from that cap and if that is the case if i retire in six years i will be capped out right now so in other words i am going to retire in six years if i do not change jobs making exactly what i make now which that was my worst fear of it all but that was not even on the negotiating table they were still worried about this $2 and get this hospital yeah that is what they were fighting for was the low end and try to get the hospital and the main campus the same 

Recording: (816/ 9621) 
yeah so it is a really tough thing to do i mean you have to be sort of organized and i do not know sort of a maverick i guess because if you could give a test that would tell who could be an air traffic controller and who could not you would be a millionaire because the government would buy that from you because intelligence is not a factor i mean there are people who do this job who i mean are not stupid but they are not college educated and really intelligent but they are extremely good at it and then the other people that i know of one that i work with it on a regular basis he has got a master is degree and he is you know he reads continuously he is always up i mean if you ask him anything about like what is going on overseas or anywhere he knows that like the back of his hand but he is one of our weakest ones you know and it is 

Recording: (817/ 9621) 
hmm 

Recording: (818/ 9621) 
in the way of benefits 

Recording: (819/ 9621) 
my bill collectors are the ones that are scared of that 

Recording: (820/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (821/ 9621) 
no i wanted to see her obviously but 

Recording: (822/ 9621) 
oh gosh he just kept saying gas gas gas and i kept saying i do not want to guess this is the first day of school i got lots of stuff to do we do not have time to play guessing games i said spell your last name he said guess talk about feeling stupid 

Recording: (823/ 9621) 
but to go see something like cats or rent they would still charge you out the bus really okay 

Recording: (824/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (825/ 9621) 
cause you gotta trust the people you are around you do not really wanna piss them off 

Recording: (826/ 9621) 
i am working on three different research projects with three different physicians two are specific to the traumatic brain injury service looking at longterm outcomes in people that have sustained traumatic brain injuries the other one is a drug study looking at control of agitation and the other one is a spinal cord injury research study 

Recording: (827/ 9621) 
exactly 

Recording: (828/ 9621) 
which is great 

Recording: (829/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (830/ 9621) 
mmm 

Recording: (831/ 9621) 
yeah i think i got really good i have actually been sitting thinking about it like what departments in the school were good and which ones were not the foreign language is really good they have immersion classes from like second level 

Recording: (832/ 9621) 
again they set different rules 

Recording: (833/ 9621) 
it was not really farming country and he went out there from iowa where you throw a corn out in the field 

Recording: (834/ 9621) 
there are two elderly women at the church this has been about seven or eight years ago father just mentioned that they had a need they had had a church bus and it had broken down so they had a need to get people to church and i met these two elderly women now the one now is 90 she turned 90 last october and the other one is about 78 now and they live together and i take them to church on sunday 

Recording: (835/ 9621) 
it might have been where the president lived they sometimes have like a mission home 

Recording: (836/ 9621) 
for whatever reason 

Recording: (837/ 9621) 
and i imagine that is about half and half right now or maybe it is more on this side i do not know so i think that that really is ever in evolution at this time tell you the truth what is going to cause the world end i think what they really mean but by that i hope what they mean by that is that it will end the way it is being run or the way it is being acted out today and that people will be more compassionate toward each other and just be happy and content and i still think that that has something to do with everybody getting back to really believing there is a god and believing that you should take the other person into consideration it might sound very basic but it is a very hard thing to accomplish especially when you have gotten into this like you said me me me me me and i got to have this and that status symbol stuff and really if we older people could get out there maybe and start making speeches somewhere and telling these kids because i know i myself in my own home i have been a collector and i take this back to the depression years when i did not have anything and my father one time when he is out of work guess what i do not know what welfare agency it was but they brought us our christmas dinner and the first doll baby i ever had and i remember when i tried to wash the thing off that little doll was one of those that sort of melted in the water and when my mother said well if you do not know how to take care of it any better than that i will never buy you another one and believe me she did not 

Recording: (838/ 9621) 
hmm 

Recording: (839/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (840/ 9621) 
see there i think there has to be a quality to life too 

Recording: (841/ 9621) 
and it makes you a better person because you get the spirituality inside you driving you and that is what is going to take you home i often ask the people you asked me about marketing 

Recording: (842/ 9621) 
like and the of is all those little words you are already supposed to know those you are supposed to be able to write a sentence even if it is just a little short sentence like my name is joanne i live at blah blah blah street i mean it is incredible it is like the curriculum keeps moving down and down and down 

Recording: (843/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (844/ 9621) 
fry

as long as you see i already knew i was gonna be getting a notice so because i flunked out like in december you know and so in january i had already contacted the navy and the air force about getting into they were taking their tests and everything taking their physicals so 

Recording: (849/ 9621)

Recording: (854/ 9621) 
and just totally bombarded and i mean here it is so force fed as well i mean i came home just before halloween and you know i walked into the grocery store and i mean just like right there were just like cakes cupcakes cookies like everything just right in front of you with like all this halloween stuff on and i mean all the holidays in here are so pushed at you and it is such a money making you know and it is so over so over the top where there it is sort of like there is a little bit of that and there are decorations and stuff at christmas but it is not so much you know and just like all the little trinkets and everything that everybody has here to put around i mean there is not that at all i mean at least in you know my experience there and i mean i can not imagine because you know western europe i think is sort of as much like america as you can get probably you know most places elsewhere in the world and i mean that would have been a fantastic experience 

Recording: (855/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (856/ 9621) 
the west side 

Recording: (857/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (858/ 9621)

i just actually i was going to send my son to a christian kindergarten but i decided to homeschool instead so i have been homeschooling him for kindergarten 

Recording: (869/ 9621) 
trash is picking up what movies are playing but i do not really rely on heavenly for news 

Recording: (870/ 9621) 
and so you know even though it turns out to be the real traditional breakdown it is not because i have to it is not because he you know he would not do something else this suits me fine 

Recording: (871/ 9621) 
and unfortunately they have to do what the people the pets say but it is just i could not be around that and i would go off on people that would do that bring that in i just feel that would be the right thing to do punch them in the mouth sometimes i am not a violent man either even as big as i am 

Recording: (872/ 9621) 
better than us i guess 

Recording: (873/ 9621) 
hmm 

Recording: (874/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (875/ 9621) 
i am a senior consulting database specialist i work for a company called oclc it is in dublin i work in it is hard to say what i do i consult on a lot of projects

Recording: (881/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (882/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (883/ 9621)

Recording: (887/ 9621) 
it is kind of a fun game it is just strange because i came down in semesters so there was still a month where everyone was down here and now there is nobody down here so it is myself my two roommates and maybe a handful of other people that we know so the social aspect has diminished a lot but that is still i mean for fun we play a lot of video games i guess you would think the natural things you would expect from a college guy 

Recording: (888/ 9621) 
wow you taught psychology 

Recording: (889/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (890/ 9621) 
it is like a car dealer that goes you know the cd player with blah blah blah blah will only raise your payment another $8 and you are like yeah but that is about the 14th $8 you have added onto this you know and it all adds up 

Recording: (891/ 9621) 
mm 

Recording: (892/ 9621) 
as far as affiliated with a party i probably respond to republicans more than democrats but i think given any choice of any party at all i am probably more libertarian than anything else 

Recording: (893/ 9621) 
so when he was a junior then he started in high school he started really seriously thinking i got to get it together what am i going to do so he agreed to go to a psychiatrist and so he went on ritalin so he took the ritalin through his last of his junior year and his senior year now he is on a medication they call welbutrin his doctor does not believe in ridland 

Recording: (894/ 9621) 
yeah it was painful but no worse since going to the hospital for my back surgery my back surgery was worse than a heart attack ever was 

Recording: (895/ 9621) 
and these people that hear voices they are not hallucinating they are hearing voices of spirits and in many cultures they will tell you most of the indigenous cultures throughout the world will tell you and the history will show that those people were revered as gifted 

Recording: (896/ 9621) 
weekends i usually try and keep free so that i can mix stuff up i do not know weekends are usually the one day of the week that is not horribly well scheduled wednesday nights are preparing for travel 

Recording: (897/ 9621)

Recording: (899/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (900/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (901/ 9621) 
he had an aneurysm he had a high blood pressure which we knew about and he started you know not being himself so he went to the doctor and they did some tests and found out he had this aneurysm that had to be operated on right away and he died under the anesthetic of a heart attack so it was very sudden and unexpected 

Recording: (902/ 9621) 
this has a set up where they have safe places where kids can go when they run away 

Recording: (903/ 9621) 
um honestly i can not say it really bothers me too much um i mean as far as just dealing with gay people or whatever it does not bother me at all it is just something i do not want to deal with or whatnot um so i mean the fact that i mean two people of the same sex are living together or married or whatnot that does not bother me like i said it is just more something that i do not know it does definitely make me uncomfortable out in public or something if i see like two guys holding hands or whatnot it is i think it is just more because it is so different than like what you normally see or things like that 

Recording: (904/ 9621) 
you can not explain that and those have been questions i have been asked by our children well how did your mom know well gee how do you know well hey that is one of the risks in life marriage but the thing is do you want to make it work 

Recording: (905/ 9621) 
no humans are violent by nature i believe i mean people have been at war since the beginning of man it is more or less greed that causes violence it is not media just like the ecstasy was an advertisement showing what you could do tv is showing you violence that you could do if you are driven to it 

Recording: (906/ 9621) 
that it is still really going on you know and his parents accepted him 

Recording: (907/ 9621) 
no what do you think is wrong with it with the system 

Recording: (908/ 9621) 
you know they all get sidelined and sidetracked by special private interests and that is the bottom line and it is sad but there is so i choose not to involve myself in that as much as possible we ended up settling for 

Recording: (909/ 9621) 
so it was neat though because pete was my mom was 29 and pete was 18 and so pete was just like some kid who liked to play you know we would go and fly kites and do all this fun stuff 

Recording: (910/ 9621) 
yeah like underground now it is gotten real big like it is still different too there is still like a really big scene and there is still like a smaller underground scene like 

Recording: (911/ 9621) 
you do too 

Recording: (912/ 9621) 
obviously i mean it is just something that just i mean you do not really appreciate it until you have gone through it 

Recording: (913/ 9621) 
but 

Recording: (914/ 9621) 
we are having like three concerts next month 

Recording: (915/ 9621)

status symbol 

Recording: (917/ 9621) 
and telecommunications is very much like a highway you need to know what your load is going to be before you construct it or otherwise your planning is way off well nowadays we are in a position where we are doing more advancement than anything our agency is the only one in the state of ohio and the private network as a private sector is still looking at us as a showcase we are doing voice over ip internet protocol which means we are doing voice and data over the same pipe and the long line carriers they do not even know how to bill us 

Recording: (918/ 9621) 
i think when i was five because it was like yeah yeah i do not really remember them being really together 

Recording: (919/ 9621) 
it is more of it tends to be more of entertainment i do not remember that being that way 30 years ago but it does now 

Recording: (920/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (921/ 9621) 
bye 

Recording: (922/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (923/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (924/ 9621) 
we take them to wyandotte lake or the zoo or all types of things the best thing you gotta get a membership to everything that is what we figured out we got cosi we got the zoo and we got wyandotte lake and that way you can go whenever you want if an hour into the show they are not participating properly you can leave and you are not out anything cosi is great we really like that they have really 

Recording: (925/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (926/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (927/ 9621) 
hmm 

Recording: (928/ 9621) 
right and i was also robbed about three times delivering pizzas for domino is in the campus area really a couple of times were down a little bit south of campus 4th street and 5th avenue near there 4th street and 7th but once was right on practically on campus 16th avenue near high street i was robbed there once yeah near that united christian center it is right there on 15th avenue 

Recording: (929/ 9621) 
i am living over on iucaa if you on the other side of high street you know the mcdonald is right by high street it is like 

Recording: (930/ 9621) 
and 

Recording: (931/ 9621) 
what i have liked so much about it is they tell you everything and then you find out that it is not right and that is wrong i mean there was the episode 

Recording: (932/ 9621) 
well maybe not columbus in particular but i do not know i think i was just a little burnt out because i was doing the two majors and i had a heavy course load every quarter and i had gone to summer school here as well just to get more done and so i had done seven straight quarters and i am sure that added to it i had a lot of hard classes and i was just tired of ohio state and tired of being here and red tape 

Recording: (933/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (934/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (935/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (936/ 9621) 
i do not believe that 

Recording: (937/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (938/ 9621) 
and they have these fads that go through and somebody asked me my opinion about the pokemon i said oh brother you know it could not be any worse than what was those turtles that lived in the sewers 

Recording: (939/ 9621) 
i just want to start laughing real loud you can turn it down so no one breaks their eardrums 

Recording: (940/ 9621) 
hmm 

Recording: (941/ 9621) 
they did not bring that he only gave 10 cents 

Recording: (942/ 9621) 
and it was fun and we made about 9000 of it by the time we were done 

Recording: (943/ 9621) 
yeah they are very quantitative as opposed to like the quality and then so the analysis is all about bottom line and the numbers because actually that is why i do not like like i like business and i i enjoy my business classes but some of the people in my business classes i cannot stand because they honestly they are like oh it does not matter how you treat people and then it is all about the bottom line well though in my opinion they will end up losing more because it costs a lot to hire a new employee and if you have constant turnover things like that then if you have a product that because obviously people are not going to care you know so and they seem very closedminded like this is the way business has to be but the professors do not seem to be necessarily like that maybe i am coming too far going to one extreme 

Recording: (944/ 9621) 
she graduated last year but she went home she was on home study 

Recording: (945/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (946/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (947/ 9621) 
i mean it is something he has to deal with he has to deal with the problems with 

Recording: (948/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (949/ 9621) 
and you have been going to ohio state that whole time 

Recording: (950/ 9621) 
and people do not seem to understand that it is not like you are collecting data for the entire population or the entire universe you are working with a sample trying to represent the entire universe well sometimes it is good and sometimes it is not 

Recording: (951/ 9621) 
mmhmm yeah 

Recording: (952/ 9621) 
i mean 

Recording: (953/ 9621) 
even in the package of information 

Recording: (954/ 9621) 
take them to the grocery store afterwards usually so it does take up a big part of sunday and i do not do it as regularly now because of the advance in age you know 

Recording: (955/ 9621) 
yeah well and that was really a struggle for money and everything so i would take whatever would come along and when you work in secure jobs like that i mean i had a different job every year i mean a year would come up and i would say ok here we go they are either going to downsize or they are going to do something and they always did so i was never really shocked and i did not panic or anything and i was never without a job i never had to i never missed you know i would say it would take probably two weeks at the most before i would be working again yeah 

Recording: (956/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (957/ 9621) 
yeah a lot of educated people who are not out to just make a bunch of money so it makes for a very intellectual interesting environment but people are trying to live simply there and i kind of agree with that 

Recording: (958/ 9621) 
yes you are you are saying you do not need to have a leader in a family and if i am going to be a leader i am going to be the one i am going to be the one not the sperm bank oh you came from this little tube here oh okay that is the principle of family no i have to be because there is no father here 

Recording: (959/ 9621) 
there were six of us born out there 

Recording: (960/ 9621) 
at the age of 10 

Recording: (961/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (962/ 9621) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (963/ 9621) 
i would say family values customs traditions divorce moving just looking at my sister my sister i mean she is very happily married but my god i mean they lived here in columbus he is from dallas they met here they moved to indianapolis they moved back here they moved up north they moved back now they are in london england they have been married what four or five years and i think they have lived six different places they are just constantly on the move they just do not have the connection with the family and i do not know if that is a bad thing it is just they are not 

Recording: (964/ 9621) 
and like the social aspects of it were the problem 

Recording: (965/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (966/ 9621) 
we will see 

Recording: (967/ 9621) 
she does not have any kids and she works and he works so everybody does pretty good now 

Recording: (968/ 9621) 
so they are kind of spread out 25 25 10 is kind of how it is divided out between the projects 

Recording: (969/ 9621) 
that is an interesting question because he was a serious contender last time i have not heard his name this time what people say they would do is that they like him because he is intelligent charismatic all those neat things that you need to be elected today and a lot of people said they would vote for him but what they say in polls i do not know if it would translate over but yeah i think he could i think the right candidate could and i think mike coleman this year in the columbus race showed that i mean he crossed gender lines he crossed party lines he crossed over into all of the city and winning even dorothy teeter is precinct which surprised me and not by just a little small margin i think it was 200 and some votes which is pretty substantial 

Recording: (970/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (971/ 9621) 
well is there any kind of training are they doing the whole job training after the two years or during the two years 

Recording: (972/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (973/ 9621) 
and i think there is a whole bunch of people that just do not want to spend any extra money on anything we are already paying for enough of things we do not want to do this 

Recording: (974/ 9621) 
uh huh 

Recording: (975/ 9621) 
really you know it is half a million dollars still out of our range 

Recording: (976/ 9621) 
and there was a lot of alcoholics in the military when i was in there 

Recording: (977/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (978/ 9621) 
mm 

Recording: (979/ 9621) 
yeah i do not really have any childhood recollections of california yeah 

Recording: (980/ 9621) 
you know it just did not even matter because you look at the wall right there it is pretty much all you have seen you would see taillights as you passed people at the side of the road we was the only people on the road 

Recording: (981/ 9621) 
laughs 

Recording: (982/ 9621)

Recording: (986/ 9621)

Recording: (987/ 9621) 
oh yes they are getting better though they really are they are much better now than they were 20 years ago because the trend is to keep these students in the mainstream as much as possible so teachers are having to learn to for example

right 

Recording: (998/ 9621) 
yeah yeah i do not know but then they second guess the mother and she risked her life they can not do that i mean you know it is too bad that she was not there to go on with what they were planning on doing but it is not our right to take other countries kids even i mean that is another thing i mean come to america we will take everyone and every you know but then we have all this crime because we have all these terrorist people that come from i mean that is all they have grown up with is the terrorist activities and the mentality and all that they come here and if they can not make it then they will just bomb somewhere and then fire but i see a lot of that too a lot of the crime is a lot of foreign things that you know you kind of want to do a study of how long they have been here and it would be interesting oh i think there is got to be a line drawn and i think that if they are caught in any kind of crime or anything and i know they send them back but i just think that we are just too open with that and there is got to be a line to say this is as many people as we care to you know i mean i know that is hard but and it is hard to draw the line but then other countries if it is so miserable there then they need to work on their country because 

Recording: (999/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1000/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1001/ 9621) 
i think with them they just need to get their heads out of the ground and look all over the place for different plays you look on the screen it is different you say well i would have done this and this and this but down on the field they have to think that they are going to be doing this 

Recording: (1002/ 9621)

Recording: (1005/ 9621) 
mhm 

Recording: (1006/ 9621) 
guns should definitely be kept in a lockbox where kids can not get them besides that there is not a whole lot that government can do it is more the parents responsibility to keep the guns out of their kids hands 

Recording: (1007/ 9621) 
you know that is his real father so i got to sit there and keep my mouth shut 

Recording: (1008/ 9621) 
i have not taken him there yet 

Recording: (1009/ 9621) 
something like that i do not know much about it 

Recording: (1010/ 9621) 
bye 

Recording: (1011/ 9621) 
so i ended up doing that for about three months and ended up plunking out of ou in the first three months of the first quarter so then i got my notice in january 

Recording: (1012/ 9621) 
i mean there are people who think cars will not run 

Recording: (1013/ 9621) 
yeah we need to pay the rent and that is yeah 

Recording: (1014/ 9621) 
so we have even been known to slightly start pulling out you know let the garage door go down i would sneak out of the car and run up to the window and knock on the window and she is on the couch and she is like i am caught it is hilarious 

Recording: (1015/ 9621) 
and then i got my master is in 75 so it took me four years that way no i never i just was smart enough to do it before i had kids 

Recording: (1016/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1017/ 9621) 
and apparently that is a way of initiating a conversation one of the guys i usually go clubbing with he is the one who got me into the low stick dancing and he said there is like a sign that says come hit on me and i am like oh great that is just what i need does not bother you at all nah it does not bother me it does not bother me i just i sort of just i am just like nah you know i am straight if they start getting really you know really pushy about it i am just like i am straight but a lot of times it is really funny because i will get in a conversation with them and they will be like you are straight are not you i am like yeah yeah i do not know how but they must it is just being i guess it must be the way i talk or something but i think i keep a lot of them away because i do a lot of really robust movements with my glow sticks so i am like fl and you know it is like this yeah i got this wide berth around me yeah it is not one of these that is a good point 

Recording: (1018/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1019/ 9621) 
oh not very right and the first 20 years i worked at the bureau i worked in statistics so i learned a lot about numbers and how to use them and what you can do with them and how easily they are misinterpreted and my wife has been the director of institutional research at the university data research they do not really have other kinds of research there 

Recording: (1020/ 9621) 
you know or a conversation piece you know or some kind of trophy well here is my dog my labrador yeah full and a lot of these people were the dogs were reacting and they were objective you know and they were because they were not being paid attention to and they were pissing on the carpet and making messes and chewing things up and these people would bring them in and have them put to sleep 

Recording: (1021/ 9621) 
so you take care of your granddaughter you know after the baby comes she will need to work i have custody of another grandchild my son when he was in high school had a little girlfriend and she was let us see he was 10th grade and she was 9th grade i guess she had a baby and i believe my son was in 11th grade when that baby was born and she had a lot of problems running away from home my son left to move into the dorm here at osu and she moved in with me i think the baby was 15 months old and i tried to help the young lady and it just turned out that the young lady was not ready to be a mother my son even now is not ready to be a father so there was a whole investigation through children is services and they gave me custody of the child temporarily and she is still there she is four and a half the mother is married and has another child now and the little one is still with me 

Recording: (1022/ 9621) 
well no they do not 

Recording: (1023/ 9621) 
not as an individual well i say that is a problem it is hard to find a balance between censorship and free flow of information and as long as people i mean some people like this information jerry springer is still running which i actually kind of enjoy watching once in a while it is kind of interesting to watch these people but i mean where do you draw the line where people should see and not see i do not know i do not want somebody telling me i can see something or telling me what my kids can see that is my job and if i do not want to see something on tv i will turn it off if i do not want my kids to see something on tv we will have an argument it used to be easy when they were little you know dealing with a 21yearold and an 18yearold is not as easy 

Recording: (1024/ 9621) 
for like a summer project or something 

Recording: (1025/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1026/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1027/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (1028/ 9621) 
if they want to get married that is their business i do not think it is mine or anyone else is to say that they can not 

Recording: (1029/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (1030/ 9621) 
i think more along the lines of physical abuses things like that would be probably crossing the line like if he got there were alleged excuse me if he was allegedly beating his wife or something like that obviously then that would cause a problem with me i can not say that i would vote for anyone like that but mean just like small things like that where it does not really threaten the nation or anything and i mean it is something that happened 

Recording: (1031/ 9621) 
i have one at northland high school she is a sophomore there and the one at ou is a freshman i am married and i live in northeast columbus by 71 and 161 that is about it 

Recording: (1032/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (1033/ 9621) 
exactly 

Recording: (1034/ 9621) 
getting married having kids you know and having a nice place to live 

Recording: (1035/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (1036/ 9621) 
yeah all my family still lives around me pretty much yeah 

Recording: (1037/ 9621) 
and it only took less than two months 

Recording: (1038/ 9621) 
donate so much okay well you remember back sometime there were 90 tax brackets and so forth so that means 90 cents on that dollar he gave 

Recording: (1039/ 9621) 
people graduate get degrees from ohio state working here taking one course a quarter and get a degree in history or whatever it might take them 10 years or something but it is like why not it is free 

Recording: (1040/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (1041/ 9621) 
where i live now i have lived there for 11 years 

Recording: (1042/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (1043/ 9621) 
i thought maybe you would crash one of their weddings 

Recording: (1044/ 9621) 
mmhmm yeah 

Recording: (1045/ 9621) 
but i have been in situations where people have told racist jokes and sometimes i let it pass you do have to pick the time to challenge someone very carefully but in other situations i have said i do not find those types of jokes funny please do not tell them anymore in my presence do what you want when you are with your other friends but do not do it in front of me i do not even like blonde jokes i find those sexist and racist in a way and no will tell them to me one day when i was still working and in an office they were telling 15 or 20 of them in a row i just kept a stone face but at one or two i did kind of smile but they were trying to get me to laugh and i would not 

Recording: (1046/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1047/ 9621) 
okay how do you get back to the original without being part of the original 

Recording: (1048/ 9621) 
i think a lot of people do not understand a lot of people do not it is a mindset they do not want to deal with numbers a lot of people or they want something easy and simple and that is what they are looking for they do not really want to know what it means and a statistic under any term any definition really is nothing more than an average of some kind 

Recording: (1049/ 9621) 
yeah it was like freshman or sophomore year 

Recording: (1050/ 9621) 
while saying while poopooing everything and saying this is dumb and stuff as far as bringing the two together like socially i think that is just a rough age 

Recording: (1051/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1052/ 9621) 
i can argue both sides of that i am at a luxury i guess where we are in a position where i truly do not have to work so if i ever felt that he was in jeopardy or he was not getting what he wanted or needed i would quit in a heartbeat to take care of that but having family with him the first year and a half i do not know i got all my schooling everything out of the way i cut down to the 60 when he was born to have more time with him i do not know it is a whole different society with emails and the computer and the internet and the cell phones i mean it is in some regards it is is much more connected but so impersonal i think moms being outside the home i think so many families are forced to do that with the cost is it the cost or is it the wants it is a very material society right now but it is also a very good economical time too the stock market overall has been up i know it is down right now but overall so the money is been flying and houses and buildings and 

Recording: (1053/ 9621) 
yeah i would i would say you know life application things would definitely need to be part of it i do not think that you should throw out english or math or you know i can not believe i am saying this history but i do not think you should throw out that stuff but i do not think that there should be as much emphasis on it i think more of the emphasis should be on life skills and just being able to make it on your own and take care of yourself but definitely i think that those other 

Recording: (1054/ 9621) 
you know i mean it was just like and then it also put a mark on you to go somewhere else so you would never want to you know ever say anything but yeah that 

Recording: (1055/ 9621) 
oh yeah well i do not know 

Recording: (1056/ 9621) 
what we are animals 

Recording: (1057/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1058/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1059/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1060/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (1061/ 9621) 
i do not think i would want my kid to go to daycare crazy 

Recording: (1062/ 9621) 
i do not know how that is even possible 

Recording: (1063/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1064/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1065/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1066/ 9621) 
no i pray at night you know i do not think he knows what i am praying to or anything like that 

Recording: (1067/ 9621) 
but i 

Recording: (1068/ 9621) 
one 

Recording: (1069/ 9621) 
they get caught with that stuff and nothing happens and it is just such a horrible example that here you have got some 18 year old kid that does something really stupid and he is 10 years in jail and then you have got this other guy that does all these really stupid things and he can be elected it is just so wrong 

Recording: (1070/ 9621) 
which one of them 

Recording: (1071/ 9621) 
i am right 

Recording: (1072/ 9621) 
i said are you kidding me i studied the weather and i know about it you are going to tell me that fog pushed that two foot pine tree across the way i mean it was a thick tree too and we get up to the next gas station he fills up and i listened on the intercom they had news on there weather and stuff tornado warning in that county that county i turned around i said now see who is the dumbass here i said i bet you do not even know how to spell cirrus cloud or 

Recording: (1073/ 9621) 
for their behavior because if they were an asshole before their brain injury they are going to be an asshole after their brain injury five times 

Recording: (1074/ 9621) 
mhm 

Recording: (1075/ 9621) 
i think it is because parents are at work and they are busy making money and they are not teaching their kids any i mean they are not teaching them to say thank you and please and just the normal you know thanks for having me when you go to someone is house just the normal i can not tell you how many kids i have picked up and driven home when i picked up my son because it was raining or something and they just jump out of the car and go bye slam the door i turn to my son and i go do not you ever do that to someone is mother now how bad do you think i want to give him another ride home when he did not even say thank you you know i did not have to bother to go out of my way and i would always try to use that as a way to explain to my kids okay you know this is how he handled it this is how i want you to handle it i do not ever want you to go to someone is house and not say thanks for inviting me thanks for having me i really had a good time you know and i do not ever want you to sit at somebody else is table and go yuck i do not like that you know if they are having something for supper you do not like you pass it on and you go i do not care for any thank you you know make a big scene like soandso did the other night at my house that you know made me feel like this big when i am the cook 

Recording: (1076/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (1077/ 9621) 
it is like oh 

Recording: (1078/ 9621) 
if you are going to do something like that you better at least know the risks involved into it and what exactly you are doing before you do anything like that 

Recording: (1079/ 9621) 
because they always dress up and everything when they go to the bars so 

Recording: (1080/ 9621) 
so we had a lot of time together and she said she thinks that was worth it 

Recording: (1081/ 9621) 
this is my family i can do what i want with it shocked and they are the ones that are going to be panicked when everything you know because it is getting smaller the world is getting smaller we are more populated now than we ever have been so people need to learn to work together and to be together 

Recording: (1082/ 9621) 
because i was not allowed to wear jeans i was not allowed to wear tennis shoes 

Recording: (1083/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1084/ 9621) 
ha ha ha ha ha ha 

Recording: (1085/ 9621) 
oh so that is 

Recording: (1086/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (1087/ 9621) 
and then the powers that be in the american army decided well we will go up to this little area ofoh i was there four monthsnco 

Recording: (1088/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (1089/ 9621) 
san diego is probably why yeah i have heard that is a nice place 

Recording: (1090/ 9621) 
we went to the zoo we go to the playground take my dog to the playground we will go shopping grocery shopping 

Recording: (1091/ 9621) 
so hey 

Recording: (1092/ 9621) 
what are your biggest worries in your role somebody decides who should have kids and who is not but i do not think god is gonna come down and do that so you know what i mean we can not really decide that but to be honest i am for it it does not have to be well i am not even sure tubestiders is pretty permanent but even if they could do something like on a yearly basis and give them $200 a year that is still not it is still much cheaper than them having kids and then if they i would give more money if they would clean up their act just for them as far as it being racist i do not think i think they are missing the point because i am sure there is some runaway white teenage girls out there too or mexican or whatnot 

Recording: (1093/ 9621) 
i got him sounds like i bought a dog 

Recording: (1094/ 9621) 
yeah we lived we moved about five or six years ago and the house we had before was some big like 80 90 year old house 

Recording: (1095/ 9621) 
yeah i got a son he is a senior at audubon 

Recording: (1096/ 9621) 
i was reading a thing though in usa i think it was yesterday where your minority and your majority you know it is always been that they were trying to make it seem like it is different it is always like the army it is always been 40 minority and 60 or something like that you know the air force has always been like 7030 or something like that you know because the standards are a little bit higher to get in a lot of people do not want to get into that you know they do not want to take them to test and everything you know my cousin that was a spent 25 years i think in the army because that is he could have done better but that is all he wanted to do you know be a drill sergeant and stuff like that you know but i just think a lot of times the media 

Recording: (1097/ 9621) 
you know so it is you know if you have a problem if you want to talk to somebody well if somebody you know personally does not they know somebody 

Recording: (1098/ 9621) 
you know not that what you wear makes you but he just he is a good role model 

Recording: (1099/ 9621) 
exactly 

Recording: (1100/ 9621) 
well i thought about that doing something in the animal area even as a vet assistant 

Recording: (1101/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1102/ 9621) 
uhhuh and then when i got my master is no i did it during the weekends and the summers and the nights and it took me about well i started teaching in 1970 or 71 

Recording: (1103/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (1104/ 9621) 
mhm 

Recording: (1105/ 9621) 
yeah i guess i am just so secure about who i am that i do not have a problem with it and i was in the men is glee club for a while so there is a small percentage of the people in there that are gay as well and i really made friends with a lot of them i guess it is just because of my personality i really do not know what it is but apparently something in my personality calls out to them and says come hey you can be my friend i am cool i am all right even though i am not one of you i can still be your friend which is sort of what i try and emanate because i am very very religious and the christian community is very is i am not gonna say can be i say they are the christian community is very very mean towards homosexuals and that is just not right i mean they are people they are making a mistake in my eyes yes but that does not mean i am gonna look at them any differently as human beings they deserve my respect oh yeah but i see everyone as engaging in sinful behavior because in my religion everyone sins i am a christian i go to a nondenominational church i do not like denominations 

Recording: (1106/ 9621) 
it is a lot easier to market yourself 

Recording: (1107/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1108/ 9621) 
yeah he and three other people well a lot of them had signed the union they have to have almost everybody sign for it but he was one of the people that had really been yes and so he fired him but not for that because you can not do that it is illegal but he sent a form letter with everybody it was exactly the same to the three people that were fired except for their names were changed for the these like basically made up reasons 

Recording: (1109/ 9621) 
yeah i have two other sisters one of them is well it is funny because we are all divorced out of the five of us we are all on one of them is on her third marriage and we are all on our second except for one she is divorced and she has not remarried and then my oldest i told you in akron i guess she is not remarried 

Recording: (1110/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1111/ 9621) 
she is the type of person i love to annoy 

Recording: (1112/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1113/ 9621) 
but she is yelling at everybody is prejudice against her and i got to sit there and shut my mouth and do her work 

Recording: (1114/ 9621) 
no that is not what i mean i do not mean it that way but i think it is better that if people get to a point where they can not work it out i think that a lot of times you can do things like counseling and those types of things and maybe there is some way to work it out 

Recording: (1115/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (1116/ 9621) 
you would be sleeping on the beach before you shell out that kind of bucks 

Recording: (1117/ 9621) 
i do not understand that 

Recording: (1118/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1119/ 9621) 
essentially all the big academics most of the us it is actually all over the world it is international 

Recording: (1120/ 9621) 
uh lunch she was there for pregnancy but she did and i am just going to public school 

Recording: (1121/ 9621) 
oh yeah um-hum it is the biggest thing 

Recording: (1122/ 9621) 
i have seen the big amphitheater and what is that what is that the opera house yeah right on the right on the what is it the ocean or whatever it is gorgeous 

Recording: (1123/ 9621) 
i would say it is not any different than having a man i mean it is a person she would just have a different way of going about it probably 

Recording: (1124/ 9621) 
yeah and i had the prerogative i could have gone somewhere else and made more money but the bad part was as the university is trying to do away with civil service civil service is a good thing and a bad thing you had step raises and everything so at least you did have an increase back then nowadays you have nothing 

Recording: (1125/ 9621) 
yeah that is it 

Recording: (1126/ 9621) 
well i was pretty well established about responsibility and that sort of thing before i went into service i was the oldest son in a family of ten 

Recording: (1127/ 9621) 
without going into too much detail one of my best friends from high school well he stayed at home and i went off to columbus and i found an amazing church down here and learned a lot and really stumbled across a lot of interesting doctrine and theological beliefs and i believe that stuff now and he does not and he feels actually strongly that anyone who believes that is like a heretic he just went off to alaska with another friend of ours and before he left for alaska i actually took the time to i did not want to but he was sort of pushing me into it because we were iming each other and he sort of pushed me into it a little bit and i told him i am like a lot of the stuff that you have talked about you know talked about not liking i believe and i told him i said i can understand if in our minds there is a problem but we accept the fact that the other person is wrong and leave it at that but that is not what you are thinking you are thinking you are looking at me and you are knowing within your mind he is evil he is wrong and i said that is not right dude i honestly do not know people get really scared there is certain i mean like there is certain denominations that will take one it is sort of like the outer limits they will take one book or one scripture out of the bible and expand it to crystal clarity and they will just run with it and that is what my mom came out of her denomination that she came out of she is not part of it anymore the denomination she came out of it some of the more devout churches within the apostolic christian church were talking men sit on one side women sit on the other women wear little thingies on their heads no jewelry the sermon is read in three different languages some really wacky stuff 

Recording: (1128/ 9621) 
you know the only thing that really really saved my son i think from getting in any kind of trouble or anything was he was so involved in sports 

Recording: (1129/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1130/ 9621) 
no no but he has a daughter and that was from high school his girlfriend got pregnant and then he stayed with her and they tried to work things out and they never got married and that was when he lived in canada so she lives in canada now and he goes he talks to her all the time and then they are real open about that i mean she is real good about letting the little girl come and she will stay the summer with us and he will drive up there and see her too 

Recording: (1131/ 9621) 
i got told i can be an idiot 

Recording: (1132/ 9621) 
so you pretty much have to be you know you can not be middle class in new york you have to be rich or you are not 

Recording: (1133/ 9621)

nobody oh she is really plain smart i mean 

Recording: (1138/ 9621) 
mmhmm yeah i think they could have i thought you got a better education out there now at st louis cool public school district you probably would have had the same as here but by being kirkwood you know relatively small and everything i think we maybe had 100 and something kids in our graduating class you know so i felt i got better attention when i wanted it you know than i would have had at a bigger school 

Recording: (1139/ 9621) 
yeah i mean getting a gun does not seem i mean i was surprised like i would i have never owned a gun but i am i think it is pretty easy to get one actually 

Recording: (1140/ 9621) 
i think it is really you really have to be careful who you put on the medication and how much you put them on and how long they stay on it and most kids do not like being on medication because it makes them different they do not look at it like gee i am really lucky i live in a day and time when there is a pill to help me concentrate they look at it like well my friends have to do it so why do i have to do it you know they look at it like it is a big pain because they have got to run over to the nurse and get their pill at lunch and generally the long acting the time released ones there is only a couple of them a couple of the different medications that are out in the time release and they only work for about 40 of the population most people try the time release and it wears off and it does not do what it is supposed to do so they go back to the six hour dosage you know one in the morning one at lunch and then their friends all know that they have to go get their pill and then they are late to the lunch line and you know they just hate it so but it is not something they can a lot of kids will not i guess they are in denial just like we would be they say well it does not help me i do not need it but when you sit down and say okay what are the things you are able to do when you are on it that you really have trouble with when you are off of it and they see it in black and white they go oh yeah 

Recording: (1141/ 9621) 
i think so yeah like the haircuts are a certain way and you have to shave and you always have to have your tie and your jacket if you can unless it is really hot it is different also depending on the climate 

Recording: (1142/ 9621) 
and it is true so that is the most powerful thing i can do when i can turn it over to god and say god this is too damn big for me to handle do you think you can work on maybe helping change this person is heart or their mind because i can not do that so i did not mean to get off on a tangent there 

Recording: (1143/ 9621) 
when i did school levy campaigns and a couple of other campaigns to me the biggest thing is what the campaign does on election day called get out the vote that is the most important thing that can be done i used to always at the beginning of a campaign for a school levy get a list of all the registered voters and of course i had a very limited population in a school district and i would would have the school district compare it to parents and the first thing i do is register parents because many of them do not vote and i read a study somewhere that the average person in this country does not even begin to vote until they are 40 if i had known that when i was in college and worked so hard to get the vote changed to 18 because i could not vote until i was 21 and i was upset you know because i wanted to vote for certain candidates because of the vietnam war that was a big issue and i could not i had to wait until i was 21 so there were a bunch of us at college that you know worked and did some volunteer work to get that whole thing changed if i would known that they were not going to vote at 18 and were going to wait until they were almost 40 i would not have wasted my time but anyway you get parents who are usually younger especially of the first second third grade age 

Recording: (1144/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1145/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1146/ 9621) 
and then it is different businesses like white castle or pizza one of the pizza places and some of the supermarkets and things and they are advertised you know throughout the community so these kids when they have problems they might want to go to huckleberry house and they do not have a way so they go to a safe house and they call and they have a group of volunteers to go out and pick these kids up take them to huckleberry house which is not far from here so i did that for a while but it was not very satisfying because i really did not feel like they were doing anything to really help the kids at huckleberry house 

Recording: (1147/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1148/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1149/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1150/ 9621) 
well i am saying on the whole world and everybody is so busy now with all the things that they have to do even me i think that maybe he is found it the same way but maybe not as much as i have i thought when i retired i was going to get this done and this done and this done and i wonder now how i went to work and still got so many things done when i got home and i am sure i am doing it just as fast because over and over again people say i have never seen anybody with as much energy you are always doing something and i think it is just that we do not have the time 

Recording: (1151/ 9621) 
oh sure 

Recording: (1152/ 9621) 
right so they do not come see me and i guess i should not care because i would just like them actually i would like them to just come for about 20 minutes so they can see this wonderful home we have that is all i care about i just want to show it off 

Recording: (1153/ 9621) 
yeah it is a lot smaller than columbus though 

Recording: (1154/ 9621) 
and i think there was an article this last wednesday in the dispatch and business section as to how the puco can not regulate it and because of that they want to deregulate telecommunications and so for the past months we have not been getting telephone bills for usage we have the backbone we are paying for and what is going to happen out of this whole thing is it offers us a lot of latitude where we can now if we have a contractor let us say over in dayton and we are calling from zanesville office i would rather make a long distance we can go on our pipe and if we have a line going over dayton we can make the call as if it is a local call avoiding all long distance 

Recording: (1155/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1156/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1157/ 9621) 
do you have one now 

Recording: (1158/ 9621) 
we can balance the brother out a little bit 

Recording: (1159/ 9621) 
i do not really think there is any huge difference i can say from what i have seen the people that went to the catholic schools they are a little bit more disciplined and know how to like organize their time better and things like that like i mean most of my friends have gone to the public schools are really overwhelmed by the amount of stuff that they have to do here 

Recording: (1160/ 9621) 
yeah i mean i guess so i mean i always spent the weekends with my dad and i spent the week with him 

Recording: (1161/ 9621) 
like because there is not like like a like it is fine leads lead person because just one person doing a mostly in most of time i mean like people do have groups that play like techno beat or in music but it is not like a lead singer who like you know it is like that it is not like that at all 

Recording: (1162/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1163/ 9621) 
it is extremely difficult to deal with 

Recording: (1164/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1165/ 9621) 
we have probably been five six times already 

Recording: (1166/ 9621) 
talk to him like you know this be nice down 

Recording: (1167/ 9621) 
hmm 

Recording: (1168/ 9621) 
um not really i mean i have been with a few people that have just i mean just randomly gotten kind of jumped i mean they did not steal anything they just beat them up for no reason or whatnot 

Recording: (1169/ 9621) 
yeah i was cutting 20 pounds in three days 

Recording: (1170/ 9621) 
white women who had actually had it done than hispanic or african american but i do not know at least in that case i mean before we were talking about the government i mean at least in that case there still is a choice i mean there is money involved but it is not so much money that it would radically change your life in a sort of you know it is not thousands of dollars it was 200 i believe and that is you know i mean if that amount of money is going to sway you in that direction i do not know i think there is the debate about 10 years down the line but is there going to be something that is going to make them change what is it going to be and how realistic is it for what percentage i do not know anything about the sort of statistics of people who do clean up their act or anything like that i do think if there is that element of choice it is a lot different than the government saying okay this is your cutoff limit but i mean the statistics they were giving on the average number of children that these women were having and the average number of children that were just taken to the hospital and left there or just dropped off wherever and the state that these children were in and their lifespan and everything else i mean there is the human rights for the mother but what about the human rights for the child is life i mean i think all that is forgotten about in so many of these cases and the same is in england everyone is saying oh because they were talking about i mean again this was was just an idea they were kicking around but sort of you know somehow sort of forcing these young girls to at least be on birth control you know in whatever way and again that everyone was up in arms but it is sort of like you know what is that child is quality of life going to be when their mother is just you know 

Recording: (1171/ 9621) 
it took us 10 years to have the baby i think my mom genuinely thought i was doing birth control and we were not but you always knew the subautotone endotones you know is she or is not she i was just like well i am not going to discuss it with her because i knew that was a nono to her but i was not but she did not need to know that 

Recording: (1172/ 9621) 
and too much prejudice there really is still and it is sad but there really is 

Recording: (1173/ 9621) 
because now they are getting to the age where they are fighting more and you got a boy and a girl 

Recording: (1174/ 9621) 
i know 

Recording: (1175/ 9621) 
and what they would say about americans and american culture at that discussion group in front of you 

Recording: (1176/ 9621) 
one thing okay go ahead well one thing i was thinking that i have a perspective on that maybe lots of people do not is how columbus has grown up 

Recording: (1177/ 9621) 
thing 

Recording: (1178/ 9621) 
so and i figured i have 100 up to 154 credits and so i am up to like 94 right now and i figured that would be a decent i mean it translates over because we are in semesters it will get all messed up there but it is like i am halfway to threefourths done with my degree so if i wanted to transfer now it would be like because after this point if i stay any longer a lot of the credits will not transfer over it would be a waste of time because most places do not like to take more than half so that is why i just figured right now i should look 

Recording: (1179/ 9621) 
i mean just like beauty and the beast there is extreme amount of violence in there you know just every one there is a bad dark side in the story so children just start and i mean it is in there and then including my own daughter she and i swear i had her watch mr rogers all the time but now that she is older she watches tv she is addicted to tv something terrible and so of course her children are but i think you know i did not have tv when i was a child child and i think you know it stimulates the imagination in some ways but i do not know what direction that imagination really goes you know but there is a tremendous amount of violence in front of everybody is face anymore as a matter of fact i am getting so i do not watch the news anymore 

Recording: (1180/ 9621) 
henderson oluwantangi 

Recording: (1181/ 9621) 
so national merit scholars also get full instate tuition 

Recording: (1182/ 9621) 
mmm 

Recording: (1183/ 9621) 
i do not under i mean it was my money so why should it matter 

Recording: (1184/ 9621) 
absolutely 

Recording: (1185/ 9621) 
just people coming from high street and just happen to be centralized right there on 12th avenue 

Recording: (1186/ 9621) 
i can check my account see how much money i got and they will actually list things that i have bought you know like how many your existing account and all that what you have bought check clearing so you can see if checks cleared 

Recording: (1187/ 9621) 
well i think we oh yeah we are church goers but just be going church goers is not being faithful i think it is just sharing yourself with one another in daily lives listening to someone outreaching to someone whatever it might be that is the ministry that i think our lord has given us 

Recording: (1188/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1189/ 9621) 
so i do not know whether they did any damage or not 

Recording: (1190/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1191/ 9621) 
it really is 

Recording: (1192/ 9621) 
yeah the police said that they have been there many times 

Recording: (1193/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (1194/ 9621) 
did you 

Recording: (1195/ 9621) 
it is like an advertisement for it 

Recording: (1196/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (1197/ 9621) 
$21 million check to hit the doorstep you know 

Recording: (1198/ 9621) 
so but that is you know i ended up settling the attorney got most of the money what little i had i invested some and then i made some bad investments when i went off my medication and you know blew it you know so that was my responsibility my fault but you know how it was just years of penn up frustration and i just i spent it i spent it in a you know unorthodox way but you know i had fun doing it 

Recording: (1199/ 9621) 
of at the same time every day 

Recording: (1200/ 9621) 
she goes well yeah dad they cost money i said oh lord 

Recording: (1201/ 9621) 
i hope so yeah 

Recording: (1202/ 9621) 
they would not know i went to two different doctors and they said you possibly will change your mind and you know i was single maybe if i would have been married they might have considered it but they said no way would they do it and we are talking 15 years ago 

Recording: (1203/ 9621) 
but the company wanted him to move to florida and he did not want to move 

Recording: (1204/ 9621)

Recording: (1206/ 9621) 
brugge 

Recording: (1207/ 9621) 
i would probably vote for bush over clinton 

Recording: (1208/ 9621) 
so i hesitate to say that it would really help them it would just be better if somebody could keep their eyes open or if we had more counselors or things like that to deal with everything including that 

Recording: (1209/ 9621) 
is this weird 

Recording: (1210/ 9621) 
yeah but the ones that they really needed to do like to set one like 71 and 70 i mean that that is a bottleneck area you know and they really should have done some of that 20 years ago you know 

Recording: (1211/ 9621) 
and when was your first chance to return back to work he was very independent but i am not sure that that is just his personality or if it was just he was adapting to his environment and where he was put being put and being in daycare from a very very young age and and then you know my youngest he is never been in daycare at all 

Recording: (1212/ 9621) 
that is still enough for me 

Recording: (1213/ 9621) 
what 

Recording: (1214/ 9621) 
cry 

Recording: (1215/ 9621) 
yes but there is nobody at home but my sister and i so domestic violence would have been a curious affair so i just figured something weird is going on i did not know what was going on but at the same time it was all divorce related and just basically dumb cause the divorce was not going to phase me because the entire marriage was we knew we knew from the beginning that it was a dumb idea and the divorce thing was kind of inevitable so we are just kind of waiting around going i am going to be divorced for a couple of months and sure enough months and sure enough so anyway so i look at these people and their names are the coming forward with two police officers behind them and mr it is kind of a large gentleman and he is way too somber for the experience and if you have to like be that somber about something as stupid as a divorce i am going to give you some sort of shit for it and at the same time mrs used to be a principal of mine in elementary school 

Recording: (1216/ 9621) 
hmm 

Recording: (1217/ 9621) 
it is they are always synonymous but 

Recording: (1218/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (1219/ 9621) 
i do somewhat just not a one of them i just got back from lunch with i mean i see him 

Recording: (1220/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1221/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1222/ 9621) 
i think there is been a lot of mistakes made by everyone on that and i really think even though i would hope there was a better way to handle it i think they did the right thing by taking him away from the cousins i mean the cousins have been stressing all along he needs family he needs well there is a much closer family than your father and they love this country and this stuff well then accept the laws and and follow them whether you agree with them or not i think i it was very unfortunate the way it happened but i think the government should not allow to let it go on as long as they had 

Recording: (1223/ 9621) 
so is that so what is the industry is there one main industry did a lot of that leave in fact it is a lot more lowkey it is more of an agricultural county ashland city is right where i live we are like five minutes outside of ashland city but ashland city is the county seat for ashland county and mansfield is the county seat for richland county yeah but everybody does everything in mansfield because there is nothing to do in ashland the mansfield branch campus for osu is there so what was it like growing up in a small town it was really boring it was really boring my dad was just getting himself settled into the community and with his job and everything my mom stayed home so she stayed with us for a while most of my early childhood memories are from where we lived in mansfield it was a real do not talk do not ask community i mean you really did not know your neighbors unless you went over and said hi they never came over yeah so it was a mostly sort of suburban kind of set up yeah yeah we lived in the suburban area of mansfield sort of like the white collar area where all the people who were businessmen were getting themselves established so and then we switched churches and also my dad opened up he and his partner opened up another branch office in ashland so we moved to the ashland area about about eight years ago almost nine years ago and we moved to ashland to get halfway between so it must be out in the sense that we have got a barn we have got tractors we lease some of the land out to a farmer who actually works it and plants stuff no not to be on a farm no my dad is a doctor 

Recording: (1224/ 9621) 
well it is competition to be earliest and the federal government is trying to stay out of the state is face so again it is another one of those things that just live with it there is enough things to do and fight in life that that is not worth it 

Recording: (1225/ 9621) 
but no see and i would have never you know you do not know until you get a reaction like that 

Recording: (1226/ 9621) 
yeah it is just so funny you know i know we talk too long but this is so much fun 

Recording: (1227/ 9621) 
like they have this they have like two doors and like they put his food there and then they close one door and then he opens and like could you imagine like 

Recording: (1228/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1229/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (1230/ 9621) 
hmm 

Recording: (1231/ 9621) 
yeah half tank gas 

Recording: (1232/ 9621) 
that is when you take him to grandma yeah that is what we do he is got to go grandma night because we live with my mom and dad so he gets to see my side all the time he does not get to see them as much so it is like when that night comes on go to grandma or like we take him to her like movies and when we want to go see a movie and because his mom gets those free tickets 

Recording: (1233/ 9621) 
mhm 

Recording: (1234/ 9621) 
do kwanzaa do hanukkah so that they can learn the other cultures and the other values but they just do not do any of them 

Recording: (1235/ 9621) 
no because i think there is the ideal in everything and if you can not live up to that ideal standard but you do the best you can do and i think that is where i was coming from i mean even now i mean i could never agree with abortion let us say i would stand by the church and most of the church laws i do stand by but i guess the birth control issue became so personal and it was just a decision that had to be made and i had to make it with what i felt was a clear conscience in what i did i do not have any regrets for it what about you 

Recording: (1236/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1237/ 9621) 
well yeah it is i will just give you a rough estimate of two and a half miles from here 

Recording: (1238/ 9621) 
well it is not that there is been too much growth i mean growth is good but now they need to stop 

Recording: (1239/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1240/ 9621) 
hate crime is an interesting term all crimes all murders are hate related i am not sure it is difficult we had civil rights laws many people were opposed to those but it was in an effort to correct years of institutionalized racism and maybe something like that is needed to stop years of institutionalized hate but a crime is a crime are you going to give someone who murdered matthew shepard six life terms as opposed to someone who murders someone else one life term i mean murder is murder and there is already a law on the books i do not think we need to have a hate crime over and above that the people who murdered matthew shepard should be tried and hopefully convicted on the facts and should not have anything else added into it i think doing that is going to do the same thing that many of the civil rights and the affirmative action programs and the busing did to people it is going to turn people against gays like it turned people against blacks for a while although ultimately i think it did make a difference i have a black friend at the ohio education association who was very active in the 60s in opening up restaurants in the south and marching and opening the schools in the south i said to her one day are you disappointed that things are not better that people still hate blacks this was 10 15 years ago she said no she said that was not my goal my goal was not to change hearts and minds my goal was to change behavior and the behavior changed except now i never thought i would live to see an allwhite jury convict white men of killing a black man we are in hearts and minds now 

Recording: (1241/ 9621) 
yeah it is 

Recording: (1242/ 9621) 
and i suggest the shot the depoprovero because that is what i am on now and that way you do not miss any pills that last for three months you know and that is what i would suggest for her you know 

Recording: (1243/ 9621) 
uh huh 

Recording: (1244/ 9621) 
i mean if we were that racist of a city then we would not be that accepting to gay pride marches and the blackout that we had on campus a few weeks back 

Recording: (1245/ 9621) 
we had the time 

Recording: (1246/ 9621) 
i do know a few people that are gay but they are in their 30s 

Recording: (1247/ 9621) 
crossdressing not crossdressing when two men live together and two women live together what do you call it homosexual gays oh okay is that the same thing 

Recording: (1248/ 9621) 
yeah i mean i did not have back problems or anything like that but it was just like the feeling it was like i am not right 

Recording: (1249/ 9621) 
it is so funny that is what my daughter is idea we are going down we are always looking to say hmm there could do the yeah and plus 

Recording: (1250/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1251/ 9621) 
yeah he is not getting that i do not think he is getting that learning that is his grandmother you know watching him and i wish that she would do more of the learning things that the daycares do do 

Recording: (1252/ 9621) 
it was part of the time 

Recording: (1253/ 9621) 
hmm 

Recording: (1254/ 9621) 
yeah there was just something about that sting far better far more than the paddle paddle was have grown older i have found it is worse in today is world as i said it has the civil rights movement and you have a right to this and you have a right to that it is terrible murderers get away with murder now by that plea bargain that plea bargain i think is the most thing that ever was passed appeals appeals 

Recording: (1255/ 9621) 
right right but that helped me just getting away getting my mind cleared doing a little bit of reading going wait a minute you know it is so obvious hello but oh yeah 

Recording: (1256/ 9621) 
mhm 

Recording: (1257/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1258/ 9621) 
haha uh-huh 

Recording: (1259/ 9621) 
yeah i was driving by the honking and everything so yeah my roommates and i got into a debate about it but we did not really resolve it 

Recording: (1260/ 9621) 
and even if you had two full bloods from two different tribes and they had a child the federal government still considered some halfblood 

Recording: (1261/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (1262/ 9621) 
um actually i was over there when all of that happened but of course it was all over the papers and you know i think i mean i i do not know what it was like really here i can imagine but i mean there especially they really focused on um not columbine but the one with the the younger kids in arkansas was a day before i was there for both of those but you know in the first one you know they they put the picture of the little kid in combat gear holding the gun everywhere and columbine every paper had a slightly different slant on the story and the facts were all over the place but that is another kind of issue but what i think caused it i mean i do not know i think that more should have been made of the fact of this terrible sort of resentment for the other students and i am not in any way defending the guys who did it but something is wrong not only with them but in the fact that they were driven to that point where they felt so hated and so maligned or whatever that you would even think of doing something like that i do not know especially with everything that was said about the families and they did not seem to of course you never really know but they did not seem to have grown up in this terrible environment and have that sort of preconditioned or anything like that yeah i think a lot more effort needs to be made to sort of placate those sort of situations and i mean who does it is sort of another question because the teachers already are overworked and underpaid and all those kind of things but i do not know 

Recording: (1263/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (1264/ 9621) 
the game 

Recording: (1265/ 9621) 
88 so we just had our 11th wedding anniversary yeah 

Recording: (1266/ 9621) 
is 

Recording: (1267/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1268/ 9621) 
yeah i think they are really helpful and i think that it is the only way that a single mom or anybody raising kids can make it there is really but there is so much fraud and there is so many people that take advantage of it that it hurts the other people that really need it you know like with me i did not want to stay on that i wanted to be on my own and i was perfectly capable of it but if i did not have the ambition that i had i might have stayed home there is like nine you know there was even a mother that lived across from me in my apartment complex that i would get up and go to work every day and she would have food delivered to her front step and she drove that year is car i mean she had a brand new like whatever year it was that is the car she had and i would just shake my head and wonder how she ever got away with it and i thought 

Recording: (1269/ 9621)

it is a very strong animal and as the old man that got lifted 25 feet in the air against the pine tree found out in my opinion when that stuff happens when i see someone light the horns of a bull on fire in spain and torment the bull and then all of a sudden the bull gets the flames put out and the bull runs his gourd through the person is leg and throws him around and kicks him right near death i do not have any sympathy for him 

Recording: (1273/ 9621)

Recording: (1279/ 9621)

Recording: (1299/ 9621) 
yeah like i knew like a lot of people who lived on campus i used to live down on hudson like over the summer before i went to osu so i mean i like campus and everything it is just like oh she was different than campus yeah 

Recording: (1300/ 9621) 
but if you love someone you want them to do what is right and you want them to learn and if that is the punishment they have to pay for something they did wrong you still love them but you are loving other people also in other words you are not letting the fact this is my child so he can get away with murder but this one over here i am not going to let him get away with it no i am sorry if my child committed something that this other one would have had to pay for i am sorry you have done that dear and i love you dearly but i tried to teach you differently i do not know where you went wrong i do not know what i did wrong whatever but you got to pay for i am sorry you have done that dear but and i love you dearly but i try to teach you different out where you went wrong i do not want to do wrong whatever but you got to pay the penalty i mean you have to draw the line somewhere but now you said family yes i think the reason that at our age we look back everyone was born and everyone was loved by a father my rail when they were little and how their formative years are and the education the the way they were taught as they were growing up does help them to become what that president is what that polity any politician is any minister or anybody else it the way you are raised i firmly believe and the things you were taught does have an impact on what you do the rest of your life and i know a lot of the things that i have done in my life are definitely based on what i saw happen back here you know and i think that it bears on everybody so that is why it really begins with the family 

Recording: (1301/ 9621) 
yeah i mean it is just sort of like the whole reputation of america just being like the country of excess like excess possessions excess food excess weight excess money you know everything you know and it is you know i sort of have mixed feelings about it the first time when i was gone for about a year and a half and i came back and you know this is i had done like a lot of traveling over there and everything and really loved the whole atmosphere especially of mainland europe and everything and i come back and where my parents live there were all these new strip malls built and stuff and i just felt like i was in this giant kmart land it just was so overwhelming even though obviously i had grown with in america my whole life and you know not that i sort of changed completely but you do when you have been away from it and to come back and you know to go into these like cavernous places and like just the other day my friend took me to easton and i mean you walk in there and i do not feel like i am in columbus you know i feel like it is got to be california or something just because it just 

Recording: (1302/ 9621) 
help

no and she said you know and the last three or four years she just wrote it out so she could retire and she used to be a very dedicated very dedicated teacher and she just it was a job then and i hate to see that happen to good teachers 

Recording: (1304/ 9621) 
if you do not make a child support payment they should do the same thing i do not know why they do not have a system like that

um when i went i went with my friend 

Recording: (1307/ 9621)

Recording: (1310/ 9621) 
i think they would have a bigger problem with it yeah 

Recording: (1311/ 9621) 
is that right 

Recording: (1312/ 9621) 
but most of the time i try it out like most of the time it is pretty easy it is pretty straight forward sometimes it is really aggravating when 

Recording: (1313/ 9621) 
that is not true i mean some of the older men and older tribes and different tribes 

Recording: (1314/ 9621) 
i go to northland high school right now 

Recording: (1315/ 9621) 
i do not go to city center too much although i like it being there if i want to go to it 

Recording: (1316/ 9621) 
no because i have a stigmatism you know the glass is cut in right here that is irritating 

Recording: (1317/ 9621) 
no my mom is she is not an invalid she is 72 years old but they go out usually to yard sales and stuff like that stuff i do not wanna do 

Recording: (1318/ 9621)

Recording: (1319/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (1320/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (1321/ 9621) 
oh yeah and i will probably step on your toes here but i am not a firm believer of mom and dad both working my wife worked until we had children then she stayed home and once they got into school she worked at a school so when they were gone she was gone when they were home she was home and my parents did not do that and i hated it i hated coming home from school by myself every day there was nobody there to talk to and i did it for years and i just feel that you know i hope you do not have children yet do you good because to me parents who put kids in daycare and after school programs are like people who have cats and dogs i get up in the morning and i feed my pet my child then i put him in the kennel and i go to work and i go gee i would like to go for some drinks after work or go to a movie we will just put her in another kennel after work and we take her from one kennel to the other kennel we go we will be back in a little bit and then i go and i have all my fun and i go pick her up at the kennel and i bring her home and i dust her off 

Recording: (1322/ 9621) 
so be it we had the ribbiters out there helping out the gis fine team effort was not it but then after gis came home the little lady went back into the house and business saw these idle lines and said hey we can do something here because in those days little ladies said well i will go out and do a little odd job we want a little thing mom will pick up a little extra things here and so forth dad was a primarywinner but she would gone to some odd jobs just to complement their needs for that budget they bought things on a cash basis as they needed it they did not go out and spend on credit i am gonna hit myself here but business said hey let us produce these lines little lady you are a free trader we can make it for you and we can make it cheap for you because we can massproduce it 

Recording: (1323/ 9621) 
yeah from what i hear actually like the emory and the university of chicago you have to work really hard because they get all the kids who wish they would have gotten to harvard and then start you know try to make it up by working harder you get to actual harvard nobody works because they are like we already made it you know 

Recording: (1324/ 9621) 
yeah and we are one of them texas is supporting strong they have like 

Recording: (1325/ 9621) 
i have come home get in the car go go somewhere you know or come on get something to eat but i think that has a lot to do with it i do not really know that tv has that much because i remember coming home as a kid and watching howdy doody and all that stuff and of course it was not the violent stuff maybe you can see on tv now but i do not really think the media has had that much to do with it it is just a different time now i mean i remember one of the things i saw when i was a kid on a newscast you know was a vietnamese guy a vietcong guy getting his brains blown out on national tv you know that did not make me good do that you know so yeah it made me want not want to do it you know because my brother was in was in vietnam he was in the army and when i got my notice he is like three years older and you know he is so man do not let do not let them draft you they will put you on the front line i said well i am going to enlist in the air force anyway 

Recording: (1326/ 9621) 
oh it was easy 

Recording: (1327/ 9621) 
he was a railroad clerk 

Recording: (1328/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (1329/ 9621) 
i am really relaxed as much as weird as that might seem you know and so for me that is like okay come on i do not really want i do not want time to do this kinda relaxing stuff i just wanna get going and do the rest of this stuff so 

Recording: (1330/ 9621) 
there you go 

Recording: (1331/ 9621) 
they were not even allowed to believe in god

so therefore they are not public they can put whatever they want 

Recording: (1334/ 9621)

Recording: (1335/ 9621) 
so i just came down here then 

Recording: (1336/ 9621) 
really and people use do people use them 

Recording: (1337/ 9621) 
well my doctor told me my blood pressure would be better if i slept at night instead of staying up 

Recording: (1338/ 9621) 
oh my sister is particularly religious and that tends to warp her view of everything 

Recording: (1339/ 9621) 
right i can understand how people do it because they come home from work and it is like i do not want to be a cook i do not want to be a cleanup so i will pay somebody to do this pay somebody that and pretty soon you see all the money they have been making gone 

Recording: (1340/ 9621) 
yeah it is 

Recording: (1341/ 9621) 
and that was part of the process there how to work work and work up there too with people but if we could just share more 

Recording: (1342/ 9621) 
because i have seen things that are not physically possible 

Recording: (1343/ 9621)

Recording: (1345/ 9621) 
i believe 

Recording: (1346/ 9621) 
alright 

Recording: (1347/ 9621) 
but 

Recording: (1348/ 9621) 
we never used the word ever but i am sure plenty of people used the word on us you know but we shared everything that we had and supposedly we had a true sharing but in terms of government i do not we were not ready for that because we had more of a matriarchy one woman who was decisive and made decisions and we would not go along with her you know but if we could get ourselves to the place where it would work that would be great and i would very much and the year that i lived in that community was one of the best years of my life of us 

Recording: (1349/ 9621) 
yeah there is a big water area it is something to do with the little mermaid or whatever but they really enjoyed all this we try to do as much as we can with them outdoor type of thing we do a lot of camping we do a lot of vacationing we try to go to ice a year at least her parents live in cape cod so they 

Recording: (1350/ 9621) 
and we start them over again they have never learned and the reason why you are throwing a carrot out too much in front of them without saying hey you got to do this to prove this to me no we have lacked one heck of a lot of ethical moral standards in this country we are losing it every day until we start looking ourselves in the mirror at night and say i am proud of myself i am proud of what i did i may not have made a dollar a day but i understood somebody today 

Recording: (1351/ 9621) 
i thought it was very strange but 

Recording: (1352/ 9621) 
i would like to go out there overseas somewhere

like 

Recording: (1357/ 9621) 
yeah yeah yeah 

Recording: (1358/ 9621) 
well a long time ago when they signed the declaration and everything they said you know build a fence around your place and take care of your own you know and i think basically that is the way the philosophy should be i think there is times when you need to be when we need to go help out other people but we try to be too much of a policeman 

Recording: (1359/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1360/ 9621)

Recording: (1362/ 9621) 
i am sorry yes 

Recording: (1363/ 9621)

Recording: (1369/ 9621)

Recording: (1370/ 9621) 
yeah well i did not realize that until i had kids 

Recording: (1371/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1372/ 9621) 
i mean i am sure at 19 i was saying some really bizarre things too but you can tell that he is thought about it 

Recording: (1373/ 9621) 
all right number one none of them had the privileges of having a car where they could drive and go anywhere they wanted when they got out of school and they got a job and they bought the car they had their car they were not allowed to have my car and take it and run over to this kid is house or that kid is house 

Recording: (1374/ 9621) 
but when he first started out i liked him he had on sensible things similar to almost what we are talking about now i think sometimes but he in order to keep up with the i can not remember all the name of the shows that i do not watch but i am doing old freeze one of them and all those other people it is just like her and of course they get into the smut and everything else and what they have done and all that malarkey and i think he decided he had to do same thing on his program or for him to keep his ratings up so you know see that is what you mean by giving in to what this person does over here and that is another thing we need to teach your kids because john doe jane doe is doing it does not mean that is right have the courage to be yourself and say no some people might think you are terrible sometimes but 

Recording: (1375/ 9621) 
and they say that is a city and my school or where i grew up was more than double that just over double that it was like 60000 

Recording: (1376/ 9621) 
you know and these schools that have a thousand people i just can not imagine i mean you know my high school was like 400 people and we thought that was big at the time and just to have a thousand people excuse me people and just to try to monitor different things i mean it is got to be so hard you know and checking everything and 

Recording: (1377/ 9621) 
yeah i live in seabird hall do you have friends who from burlington who are also going to high school oh yeah i think there are 170 of us here just from my class alone 

Recording: (1378/ 9621)

Recording: (1379/ 9621) 
you can do anything for $50 a week you can work two hours a day for a week and $50 for two kids is really not that much a week 

Recording: (1380/ 9621) 
well i think the people that made that law should also too not be able to keep their jobs for more than two years and see how they like it 

Recording: (1381/ 9621) 
and i had to get out and other ones it is a struggle with that thing and understanding it it takes time to understand it a lot of people a lot of good people are helping me to try and understand it i was trying to let the fear of that though i am not afraid to die i am afraid sometimes that i will die before i get a chance to do what i feel i was sent here to do which is just the basic things fall in love with somebody have children raise them 

Recording: (1382/ 9621) 
me too years ago 

Recording: (1383/ 9621) 
and my but now my daughter is my daughter has twin sons who just are a year out of college and i think that they are one of them particularly is i think in good moral good sort of guy and the other one i do not feel like i know as well but i really think that they are both good and uh see 

Recording: (1384/ 9621) 
well i work parttime kind of because i worked fulltime when he was one and i felt like the babysitters or whoever saw him more than i did because i love my son more than anything in the world and i felt like he needed me so i went down to parttime i am struggling more but i would rather see my son have me 

Recording: (1385/ 9621) 
i moved just moved into 161 cleveland area i lived up there for years but i just moved back up there and why i left it was because of the the city the traffic and everything where you get around campus you know it is a lot i mean it is all hustle hustle hustle but down here even with the kids and everything going to school but basically it is kind of laid back where up there it is all go go go 

Recording: (1386/ 9621) 
well it is harder than i think in some ways than people think i went to the teach ohio fair last year to look around and did not see that much interest in chemistry or general science teachers i think the market has fluctuated back to a point where they do not need as many right now they are not clamoring for us 

Recording: (1387/ 9621) 
is there really 

Recording: (1388/ 9621) 
i think people are still fairly racist i do not think it is near as bad as it was but at the same time i mean i can not say i blame the white community so much for it i would say it is probably both the white and i guess any other race relations fault i mean as far as like if you look at the black community things like that you have like have like bet you have like the united negro college fund things like that where they are almost segregating themselves by having these organizations because they are geared specifically towards black people and i think in a way that is almost segregating themselves from the rest of the community because they are not giving out equal opportunity to the people that need them it is sort of like the same thing white people were doing you know 30 40 years ago where that they had their white organizations or whatnot and i think it is sort of going along the same lines where there is still a problem of it but i think it has gotten better at least if nothing else 

Recording: (1389/ 9621) 
where that nice mall is and some in smyrna which is outside of atlanta but girls that i met through school and stuff 

Recording: (1390/ 9621)

i mean i am sure there is some but it is not as extreme as some places that i have been 

Recording: (1392/ 9621)

Recording: (1395/ 9621) 
oh i am sure 

Recording: (1396/ 9621) 
it is not that the property taxes are that much higher anyway it is that the homes are worth more because of the school system 

Recording: (1397/ 9621) 
definitely definitely 

Recording: (1398/ 9621) 
oh it has you know your basic lazarus which i like to go to lazarus and sears and jcpenney is and no i would not want to drive to polaris to go to those stores but if they made some outlets over there you know i would be happy with that there is just a lot of smaller stores you know like victoria is secrets and bookstores and toy stores and athletic wear stores a lot of those i do not even go to get some kiosks set up outside you know with the little carts with different little things they sell just like your basic kind of mall

Recording: (1419/ 9621)

well looking at me you want a dollar more and they are making thousands but yeah i do not want to do that anymore i want to go somewhere i have got somebody helping me just an acquaintance of mine that is kind of a headhunter and i have given him the idea that i want to either work for an attorney that is going to make some changes or do something that way i have got a lot of administration and manager and things like that background so i can have fun doing what i know how to do but also accomplishing something that is what i want to do i have not found it yet i have got an interview with a radio station though and that is kind of 

Recording: (1427/ 9621) 
well most kids what they do is they tell something in the body that should be in the body way up here in the end most people get ahead of themselves 

Recording: (1428/ 9621) 
oh yeah i was like whoa ed was like oh i gotta figure out how to do that i was like you can not do that i flipped out yeah he broke into oh my god i can not remember what it was but he had all these numbers for credit cards and he was threatening to sell them on the internet

yeah i am a democrat i have never voted for a republican in my life even when i lived in oregon and i always adored mark hatfield i did not vote for him when i was out there we are insane because i thought he was a great republican but i think personally mike coleman was good i have met well we had a diamond jubilee at the village and coleman and teter both came and they both i thought it was in some ways kind of a close race i mean i did not think that there was that much difference in them ideologically i think you know she would do just about the same as he is he might be a little bit better but in terms of having a black mayor i think that is good for columbus i think 

Recording: (1431/ 9621) 
enjoy them now you get the terrible tease go through which is which is cool and i remember one time when we get in a big argument one time when she when she turned teen teenager and i called her up and she was on the phone with somebody else and i said there and said well you know i am calling a long distance she goes so i am talking to my girlfriend i said so what hang up on her and call her back and 

Recording: (1432/ 9621) 
my older brother lived in bloomington for a while and he ran a music store on this square in the center of town it might have just been called bloomington music i am not sure he sold guitars and things on the square right across from the courthouse yeah yeah 

Recording: (1433/ 9621) 
so i think that is a problem too everybody says well i do not want to get there at 830 

Recording: (1434/ 9621) 
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm 

Recording: (1435/ 9621) 
yeah he is a father definitely 

Recording: (1436/ 9621) 
it is like big deal you know common sense it is hot you do not put it in a sensitive area while you are driving to work but she sued for 10 million and the paper said she won 10 million she did not i mean after that 10 million award was given by a jury then the mcdonald is is allowed an appeal at the end of a year so she does not see any money for a year and that is if they do not appeal but 90 of these big corporations have the money behind them they have lawyers behind them so they can sue for an appeal 

Recording: (1437/ 9621) 
i was a professor it was interesting i mean it is a lot it is hard to remember a lot of terminology but i enjoyed it 

Recording: (1438/ 9621) 
typical dorm room 

Recording: (1439/ 9621) 
that is probably when they started yeah 

Recording: (1440/ 9621) 
yeah it is hard because i am a christian so i believe that homosexuality is wrong but like i said i am not going to condemn them at all like i said i have friends i understand what you are saying but i think that is something more for the parents or the teacher to pick out maybe that child is having a problem and then send them to counseling of some sort and not actually incorporate it in a 30 student ensemble it would be nice if we had more of an open environment in schools and if teachers really had the time to notice that maybe somebody had a problem and talk to them about it and then send them on that counseling one on one way just because if you are going to teach it to a large amount of students i am not even sure if that one student would listen because all the rest of them would probably be making cracks and just make them feel more do you know what i mean 

Recording: (1441/ 9621) 
that is pretty cool 

Recording: (1442/ 9621) 
al gore really does not entice me at all he claims he invented the internet 

Recording: (1443/ 9621) 
i sort of agree with the fact that if someone wants a gun they will get a gun it does not matter what they do to try to make it so people can not get their hands on guns they are basically always going to be around and people are always going to get them if they want them 

Recording: (1444/ 9621) 
mmmm 

Recording: (1445/ 9621) 
no not really all my good friends from well i would say like out of all my good friends from high school one of them no two of them are still here 

Recording: (1446/ 9621) 
well what neighborhood do you live in because i see asians and indians everywhere but boy they do not live on my street 

Recording: (1447/ 9621) 
my stepmothers 

Recording: (1448/ 9621) 
yeah you know that is the thing so i think just being aware and then also like i said with all the i mean and i am so opinionated in this too and anybody that knows me i look at all the advertising i look at the advertising and i look through and i see lazars and i see kohl is and i see sears you look through and you say oh okay you know you are looking for things to buy well then you got a two whole two pages of women in bras and they are looking at the camera they are seductively looking at the camera and you are like okay how many how many different bras do women really need that is not for the women i am sorry you know most women by the time they are buying bras know what choices they have you do not need all that but then it is funny because then i keep flipping through and i look at the men the men is heads are usually cut off they are not wearing any kind of revealing underwear at all i mean it is just so unequal so we leave these guys or these poor boys that are growing up we push all this in you know and then expect them to deal with it you know and they see tv shows and everything else shows and everything else that it is okay to be with five women but boy that woman is with more than one man i think it is what we teach our kids and that goes back to the government and society and what we are allowed to show our kids you get involved in the free speech and that is fine but wait until those kids grow up and wait until those people that were pushing the free speech get smugged or anything else happens to them 

Recording: (1449/ 9621) 
not the actual going through it you know to me it was to her but the aftermath basically you know you just 

Recording: (1450/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (1451/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1452/ 9621) 
i mean actually run over and killed 

Recording: (1453/ 9621) 
mmhmm oh boy it is it is a lot of work it really is she is a nurse and she works at the medical center in the breast cancer department she is a or nurse she is worked here for 22 years also got her degree at ohio state she grew up in dayton and then moved here to go to college and then stayed at ohio state after college 

Recording: (1454/ 9621) 
ha ha ha 

Recording: (1455/ 9621) 
he can eat fresh water 

Recording: (1456/ 9621) 
ah 

Recording: (1457/ 9621) 
and 

Recording: (1458/ 9621) 
oh i think 

Recording: (1459/ 9621) 
i did 

Recording: (1460/ 9621) 
huh 

Recording: (1461/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (1462/ 9621) 
so that is you know a lot of my decisions were based upon that 

Recording: (1463/ 9621) 
but you know i think what they did was fairly good they did not really as far as i remember at that point at least they did not well they must have done gone into the sort of moral issue but what i remember was more of a scientific approach 

Recording: (1464/ 9621) 
for amcs for not getting hurt she works at fedex and her crew is always getting hurt mainly her 

Recording: (1465/ 9621) 
first year yeah second quarter 

Recording: (1466/ 9621) 
no no but hopefully when they do get the one strike somebody i say somebody because right now i do not really think we have that in place but we would need more of a one strike stepping stone let is face it counseling is probably not gonna work and somebody in that it would almost take i do personally know people that go into that type of environment here in columbus and actually work with the families and work with the kids and actually are in there living there showing them you know it is one thing to go help them and then leave that and go home to your nice house i do not i admit it i could not do it but if people really did things like that i think there would be hope for them because they are actually friends or actually people that have been in that environment and come out those type of people i think might be able to reach them i will not be able to reach them probably just because what do i know about it yeah i agree i do not think it would be a deterrent at all initially but if we had more things in place and somebody actually realized the background and tried to get them out of that hopefully even if you save half of them it is better than anything 

Recording: (1467/ 9621) 
yeah i am not going to go to that world i want you to go to that place 

Recording: (1468/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1469/ 9621) 
she is our guy right 

Recording: (1470/ 9621) 
uh huh 

Recording: (1471/ 9621) 
well it was both really because there is kids who lived there since i lived there that was 13 years ago and being that long in the same neighborhood just does not really get it with me 

Recording: (1472/ 9621) 
no not often my daughter has a very intense life and so i do not see them near as often as i like we just do a oneday thing because it is fairly easy to drive to toledo so i go real early in the morning and spend six or seven hours with them and then come back and she does the same thing she comes down here and we just do the one day thing now because of the children she worries about the children and blah blah blah blah you know so it is better just to go so i know what they are doing and everything but i do not i am not the old fashioned grandmother 

Recording: (1473/ 9621) 
i guess 

Recording: (1474/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1475/ 9621) 
it is implicit thing is to like when we bought our house we had looked for months and months and months and i wanted an old house it was built like 1917 i want an old house that had not been kept up 

Recording: (1476/ 9621) 
yeah it ai not gonna change that 

Recording: (1477/ 9621) 
um they did briefly like cover things like that with like religion and health classes things like that 

Recording: (1478/ 9621) 
it is been remarkably well i mean i have not had any problems i found out pretty early which was kind of strange at about four weeks and i went in and i had a checkup and my doctor he thought i was about seven but they wanted to do an ultrasound well the thing is they did this ultrasound they did not find anything so which was really kind of creepy because they did not know because there is that whole tubal pregnancy thing and all this stuff and the guy that did my ultrasound not my regular doctor and he is kind of he is just a little abrupt for me and he says well you know if this is what it is you know you could have a lot of serious problems you could die and all this stuff and i said wait a minute i am not ready for this but after we figured out that it was just the time period other than that it is gone really well i mean i just and i know we just finished our lamaze classes last night and there are some women in there they are huge i mean these girls can not even get off the floor and i just feel really bad for them so for me it is gone very very well i mean i have not really had any problems 

Recording: (1479/ 9621) 
i think my daughter jennifer is very active not so much the type of work that i do but i think she is very charitable very giving very 

Recording: (1480/ 9621) 
well i do think access is too easy but it is sort of like anything else i think if laws were passed the people who were against it would be so you know just beside themselves that it would i do not know for how long but i think it would make the situation not with the shootings and things like that but i think it would make the just the gun situation probably much worse for a while because people would be you would be doing illegal things to get guns and that sort of thing but too many people have guns here there is too much of a gun culture over there they have pretty much outlawed guns except for hunting and things of course there are some floating around but the fact that you can pretty much successfully do that obviously england is such a small country in comparison but i mean that is just amazing to me but it is true i mean the fact that the access is just there is almost nothing barred and i mean just the amount of people that i just hear sort of in conversation talking about oh yeah getting a gun for security and all this stuff it is like your chances of number one needing it and number two if you were in that just minute percentage happen chance that you would need it the fact that if you used it to shoot someone who was not you know i mean everything is against you 

Recording: (1481/ 9621) 
why i do not know it does not make sense 

Recording: (1482/ 9621) 
oh it was on saturday 

Recording: (1483/ 9621) 
well you know in my girls there are certain products that brand name like one of them i know is the meyer pudding that you can take for lunches which they do and it is like edventure you know edventure but it is edventure well every once in a while hunts will be the same price and there will be a coupon on the paper so joyce will joyce we trade she goes to the grocery store once then next two weeks i go and then next two weeks she goes so she will buy stuff like that with a coupon and i go why are you buying that and she goes it was cheaper than the meyer brand and then when we eat it it is like it is too sweet or it is too overpowering or too sugary and the girls even think the same way they go we do not like this it is too chocolatey 

Recording: (1484/ 9621) 
but would you say it is a nice place to visit but you would not want to live there or would you actually live there 

Recording: (1485/ 9621) 
when okay when they when that song came out you would probably hear it at least 12 times a day on some of those radio stations and it got to i just i cannot stand this i can not stand it 

Recording: (1486/ 9621) 
i do not know i would like to say no sitting here but you never know because i guess that is what happens to a lot of them they come out of school all idealistic and then they go into industry and then they are molded and assuming they make upper management you want the tax breaks you want the thing you know what i mean and then i have an uncle he is a vice president on wall street for merrill lynch and he said he got out of school and was very idealistic but now he is like oh those people i made it through myself realistically he did not 

Recording: (1487/ 9621) 
think what 

Recording: (1488/ 9621) 
uh huh 

Recording: (1489/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1490/ 9621) 
and then ohio and then back down to tennessee and then back to ohio 

Recording: (1491/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1492/ 9621) 
oh i do not know it just seemed easier life was i do not know it just was not the driving is the main issue with me the freeways we have here were not built for the amount of people that travel on them now i remember when they built 71 north i remember when they built 70 east there were no freeways i remember going up 315 when they first opened it and it was like nobody was on it you could just drive on it and it was like an empty road that nobody knew about yet now it is like a parking lot every day it is just a lot of different stuff about it that and i do not know it seems like activities to go do things everything is more crowded my wife thinks this city is the eatout city you know everybody if you go anywhere at 630 everybody and their brother is eating out all the time it seems like constantly we live near mill run which is an area they have just built up in the last few years that just has like 20 restaurants in it you drive by any of those at five six oclock every lot is full to the brim i do not care if it is tuesday thursday you know 

Recording: (1493/ 9621) 
or you could do the university of oregon it is a very nice very small university but it is nice 

Recording: (1494/ 9621) 
and we could do what we wanted 

Recording: (1495/ 9621) 
when i first got a divorce so it is been hard 

Recording: (1496/ 9621) 
that once you filter it through something it looks different but previous to that yeah there is a lot there there is way too much shared experience to gloss over effectively so when she said look if you never listen to anything else that i say you will listen to this you need to go to europe i was like okay i will go to europe 

Recording: (1497/ 9621) 
i had a conversation with her about it and said you know you did not cause anything me and your mother caused it all if anything you were the brightest spot of the whole marriage and that is the way you got to look at yourself when you see that reflection in the mirror remember that 

Recording: (1498/ 9621) 
sexuality and all 

Recording: (1499/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (1500/ 9621) 
your forceful personality too 

Recording: (1501/ 9621) 
hehe 

Recording: (1502/ 9621) 
where northland is 

Recording: (1503/ 9621) 
oh it will be 

Recording: (1504/ 9621) 
no because all the kids take that california achievement test i do not know if you are familiar with that say like you and i go to school you go to dublin and i go to the worst school in columbus and we both make straight a is well when you take the california achievement test the a is mean nothing because it is like let us see what you understand and have learned the score on that is what really matters to me and both my daughters have really scored exceptionally high on those because they always pick on columbus public schools they go oh look how bad their test scores well if you take say the worst school in town which i do not know what it would be but let us just say it is brown school well you have children there who have not seen dad in probably 10 years and mom is basically sometimes there or in prison so they live with grandma how do you expect them to do well nobody is there to you know i am not an ogre or anything but i always keep tabs on my kids i have always gone to conferences even though they got straight a is i go to conferences and teachers go well what do you come for and i go if i do not come then it is like saying i do not really care so i always go so they know that i am keeping tabs on things and i do not demand a is i just demand them to do their best and i said you know if your best is a c then that is what it will be but i said if your best is an a and you are getting a c you got me to talk to you so back to the brown school there are kids like my daughter there who make straight a is and when they take the what is that thing the proficiency test zoom through it and get like outstanding on it and then you have this probably sounds really biased or bigoted but then you have the kid whose mom and dad are not together and he comes to school maybe twice a week and when he takes a proficiency test he gets like a 

Recording: (1505/ 9621) 
like i had my kids last week i had them all write how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and then i had them one by one come up to the table in the front they did not know i was going to do this so after they got it all done i go out and i get my little bag of stuff and i bring in my bread my peanut butter my jelly and i sit them down beside me and i go okay now no adlibbing no adding no taking away read exactly what you wrote 

Recording: (1506/ 9621) 
and none of the other coaches did either 

Recording: (1507/ 9621) 
you played saxophone in the band 

Recording: (1508/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (1509/ 9621) 
they are pretty much all underground things they have a web page up i am not sure what the address is right now 

Recording: (1510/ 9621) 
i mean my kids went to a school that well my son had already left it but in the fourth grade they announced took all the kids in the auditorium and said we are closing next year and it was hard but once it is reached the point that decision is made and announced then i think there were good reasons for it and they explained the reasons and at some point you have to figure out how much do you want to fight something when it is inevitable 

Recording: (1511/ 9621) 
the mustiness the old 

Recording: (1512/ 9621) 
every kid that my kid ran around with i knew his parents one way or the other 

Recording: (1513/ 9621) 
you do not have too many options you know 

Recording: (1514/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1515/ 9621) 
because the larger story was too large to film in one movie but this one as a part of a whole i am reserving complete judgment until 

Recording: (1516/ 9621) 
oh okay 

Recording: (1517/ 9621) 
as a lot of mothers do but she was there and if they needed her for anything or needed her to say no to something she was there and i think that that probably had something to do with it and the fact that our kids knew what our moral beliefs were 

Recording: (1518/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1519/ 9621) 
i do not think she would have it any other way 

Recording: (1520/ 9621) 
yeah meet different people 

Recording: (1521/ 9621) 
oh lassie is one of them yeah along that line 

Recording: (1522/ 9621) 
even if they do not pay me it is still gonna be fun 

Recording: (1523/ 9621) 
i said you have nothing like that for kids nowadays 

Recording: (1524/ 9621) 
yeah it is like i do not know they used to have something called exploring posts that were directly related and then venturing kind of took over for that like still in boy scouts and then exploring went off on its own and as a result they took religion out of the program and they put they allow homosexuality with the leaders and all that so it is sort of like so it is i do not know we call it like hippie boy scouts 

Recording: (1525/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1526/ 9621) 
and we pick out of those because otherwise your kid is gonna hate you 

Recording: (1527/ 9621) 
we had counter battery fire we called it which when they were shooting back at us once in north africa was kind of scary we were in position where we could fire on a tank battle that was going on we had a forward observer up there where he could look down and see the whole thing and so he was adjusting fire and i do not know how many tanks they claimed that we hit but 

Recording: (1528/ 9621) 
and so it was kind of funny but the discouraging i mean it was discouraging when you see people that do not have any hope and 

Recording: (1529/ 9621) 
child abuse 

Recording: (1530/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1531/ 9621) 
i do not know i have not really formed an opinion 

Recording: (1532/ 9621) 
yeah well yeah yeah i mean it happened a lot and i have had two abortions one illegal and one legal 

Recording: (1533/ 9621) 
yeah my sister and her husband just moved back they went out to nebraska for a year 

Recording: (1534/ 9621) 
they are all in business they work they are scattered i have a son in sacramento and a son in atlanta georgia 

Recording: (1535/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (1536/ 9621) 
yeah it is been like that every year basically 

Recording: (1537/ 9621) 
yeah they will not bother it 

Recording: (1538/ 9621) 
you said a word there government government stays out of things that is our problem government is into too many things they need to be out of your nose that is your personal business they need to be out of your business 

Recording: (1539/ 9621) 
i just think it is sad even here in columbus you know like two weeks ago when they had these bomb scares in different high schools and i thought you know i just you know it is just because of all the things you have seen in the world in the last year that these kids want to do this just to see what is going to happen 

Recording: (1540/ 9621) 
now what that is industrial nucleonics or something like that well think about it now you got the wetlands down there where are kids going to go 

Recording: (1541/ 9621)

i was born in dayton ohio i lived there almost 35 years before moving to columbus in 1981 i lived in northwest columbus for 18 years i moved last january a little farther west about five miles further west near hilliard but still live in the city of columbus so i have been here about 18 19 years i like columbus also i think it is a great city although the last three months i have threatened to move on more than one occasion because of all the traffic congestion and all of the road construction you just can not get anywhere it is very frustrating but other than that columbus is a great city i went to this is something different about me most people do not know that it existed in the 20th century but i went to an allgirl catholic school for 12 years so there were no boys i was not in a classroom with boys until i got to college i went to college at wright state university my parents could not afford to send me so i had to work two years in high school two years after high school to pay my way through college taught school for about eight and a half nine years and during that time got my master is degree in remedial reading taught for i think i said this about eight and a half nine years and my life and career took a whole different turn and became president of my teacher is association or teacher is union and that led to a job in political action because i would always been active in politics from high school on the first campaign i worked in was for john kennedy in 1960 i was a freshman in high school and continued working in campaigns in a volunteer status several different campaigns in ohio and in dayton where i came from but moved to columbus to take a job as a political action consultant for the largest public employee union did that for a couple of years until i went out in the field and negotiated labor contracts did that that is kind of stressful so i decided to strike off on my own and try some public relations and marketing and did that i have never been married did not plan that that was not a goal in life it just never occurred so i have no kids but i have a pet and now i call myself semiretired i get a small monthly retirement and then i supplement my income by doing things like this i am an independent contractor i do training i do different things where people get my opinion i have done a couple of things with lawyers looking they do mock trials on real issues and then you listen to all of the stuff and then you you know pretend that you are a jury and come up with a decision and i guess they use it in forming their case and going into court so that is fun so that is a little bit about me i would say my family my mom and dad well my mother was first generation american my grandparents came to this country from hungary and that was a neat experience i like growing up talking to my grandfather about what life was like as a peasant in hungary and he thought this was the greatest country in the world and that rubbed off on me i still do also he always voted so i learned at an early age that it is important to vote my mom and dad were both alcoholics i have two brothers no sisters one older than me one younger than me and i have no children but i have a pet that is my child and i always say pets are children you raise pets you spoil so my pet is very spoiled 

Recording: (1543/ 9621) 
he went to columbus schools and the kid did not know what he had he just found it laying around his father is car in the glove compartment brought it in to show the other kids that was very upsetting to my son he was very sensitive he used to be again i do not know if that is normal for teenagers or not but he used to be very sensitive to other people i do not know if he is or he just will not let himself be right now 

Recording: (1544/ 9621) 
that is fine 

Recording: (1545/ 9621) 
they have to get a larger police department to do that that is another thing the cities have grown so much that we do not have adequate protection i do not think anymore 

Recording: (1546/ 9621) 
that is really true 

Recording: (1547/ 9621) 
i have been back there for about 10 years i would like to move back down there but there just is not any work you know unless you own your own company so that basically is remodeling drywall stuff like that 

Recording: (1548/ 9621) 
yeah that was the most somebody could be ordered to pay being unemployed 

Recording: (1549/ 9621) 
hahaha 

Recording: (1550/ 9621) 
yeah it basically feeds into itself in that manner rather than high taxes exorbitantly high it is a little higher but it is not ridiculously high 

Recording: (1551/ 9621) 
they ai not gonna lock me up 

Recording: (1552/ 9621) 
hmm 

Recording: (1553/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1554/ 9621) 
i would be taking in foster kids i raised a little boy from the time he was born until he was six well he was my friend she is a single woman and she wanted to adopt but she said she would not adopt if a child would have to go to daycare and this was when my daughter started kindergarten and i said if you get a baby i will take care of him until he starts school 

Recording: (1555/ 9621) 
you can see with the housing trends and there again it goes back to the stupid consumer i say stupid consumer because when i was in college i always said well the consumer had a fourth grade education level 

Recording: (1556/ 9621) 
just for the courses that i need 

Recording: (1557/ 9621) 
what else 

Recording: (1558/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1559/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1560/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1561/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (1562/ 9621) 
yeah i just like doing it and i have a good set my best friend is a realtor she is since retired but it is so funny because she would always go through all these statistics and this and that because the stuff i have done is in and because i live in area and so she would say oh i do not know and she said well how much do you have to get it for and how much and i would say oh i do not know i think if i get it for under a hundred five i probably can tell for a hundred forty if i this this this and this now you are going to put a lot of money into that though it is not like you are still only going to make maybe $10000 profit and she would say well i do not know for a long time she was always real skeptical because i would just make up these numbers or just have this idea and finally she says oh rachel i do not know it always works out for you you always get that so just do it and it is just some intuition kind of thing 

Recording: (1563/ 9621) 
like it is like we are taking catalog orders over the phone it is not really a big deal like they are not seeing how we are dressed at all i mean they tell us which is where college church and stuff but nobody does like they do not really enforce it and they too they yell at like knife like for hugging or whatever like they told us that one day that we could not hug and they are like no that is like you can not hug in here or something like that they are like it takes away from the professional attitude it is like i do not even know what to say to people like that like this is like such a different like 

Recording: (1564/ 9621) 
no they are all boys 

Recording: (1565/ 9621) 
i think that would be perfect 

Recording: (1566/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (1567/ 9621) 
i used to kind of worry about the effect that tv had on me when i was little i used to watch a lot of tv i would come home from school and plop myself in front of the tv and watch four cartoons back to back or so every day after school that kind of thing and then saturday mornings it would be a block of from six in the morning until afternoon or something these days i do not watch nearly that much tv i do not buy these arguments that people make that say that like children are like violence in tv is affecting children i mean i have seen some evidence of exercises where in schools kids will watch a violent cartoon like roadrunner or something and then be a little rougher but i do not think that it goes into values i do not associate like rise in crime or something with like crime on tv or something i mean if there is a correlation yeah i am more of the you know like you know parents have a greater influence on the children than tv ever could i mean i like watched a lot of tv but i feel that my parents taught me what was right and wrong i watched a lot of rather violent tv violent movies all that kind of thing 

Recording: (1568/ 9621) 
i remember mcguffey lane and if you know 

Recording: (1569/ 9621) 
nope not my area not my area if it is hot in here 

Recording: (1570/ 9621) 
oh yeah there is always people out there 

Recording: (1571/ 9621) 
yeah but he is always he is had like girlfriends where he is lived with them and he had a child and they lived together but he cheated on her 

Recording: (1572/ 9621) 
so that means you are a good problem solver you are a good logical thinker you are good in science you are good in math you know so there is a few things you are not good at it does not mean you are stupid you know i would much rather be stranded on an island with six 

Recording: (1573/ 9621) 
you know we really do not know much about his life away from home 

Recording: (1574/ 9621) 
they cannot understand where you are coming from 

Recording: (1575/ 9621)

Recording: (1576/ 9621) 
cause it is hard being the only girl in the house 

Recording: (1577/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (1578/ 9621) 
ugh 

Recording: (1579/ 9621) 
i think they fly to omaha so it is not too bad that is pretty easy to get into 

Recording: (1580/ 9621) 
and as with a lot of the resentment that is felt that i experienced toward americans rather saddeningly i think our culture is starting to really infuse itself into europe at least i mean i see instead of us becoming more like them them becoming more like us walmart has bought a big retailer there 

Recording: (1581/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1582/ 9621)

Recording: (1587/ 9621) 
yeah yeah archbishop romero yeah in el salvador that is right that is right that is right yes so there are conservative and progressive wings in every religion i am sure even probably unitarian universalist although i have heard that the more conservative unitarian churches are in new england around boston where it was started and there are some that are relatively conservative there but for the most part it is what you would call liberal religion yeah are you 

Recording: (1588/ 9621) 
right yeah well you can not even put a price on it either 

Recording: (1589/ 9621) 
wow 

Recording: (1590/ 9621)

Recording: (1594/ 9621) 
where it took me to 

Recording: (1595/ 9621) 
you can hit the road if you want of course the only thing he had was nothing 

Recording: (1596/ 9621) 
pretty much anywhere in delaware that i can find

mmhmm 

Recording: (1598/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1599/ 9621)

Recording: (1600/ 9621) 
listen to music 

Recording: (1601/ 9621) 
see i am not sure if universal health care would be the thing i think it was my freshman year my sister and i went to donasila the 

Recording: (1602/ 9621) 
that is right 

Recording: (1603/ 9621) 
i do not hear you 

Recording: (1604/ 9621) 
mmhmm yeah and then my other sister just recently got divorced this year or i guess it was finally ended last year and she is got two kids raising them and so they are all most of them except for linda and bobby bobby is the one in connecticut and linda is in akron but everybody else is within 10 minutes of each other 

Recording: (1605/ 9621) 
gotten somewhere else 

Recording: (1606/ 9621) 
and that is what i like about it is the ambience and the river and the apartments are just very very plain 

Recording: (1607/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1608/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1609/ 9621) 
okay well i am not really from columbus either i have been here for a little over a year now my husband went to high school here and had a daughter while he was in high school so after he finished college he wanted to relocate here and we kind of lived between worthington and westerville kind of north columbus and i like it a lot 

Recording: (1610/ 9621) 
no it is very much so 

Recording: (1611/ 9621) 
been highly critical of organized religion 

Recording: (1612/ 9621) 
none of it means kind of the traditional light at the like a big tunnel with a bright light at the end or they were floating above themselves looking down at themselves at the accident scene seeing a dead relative something like that 

Recording: (1613/ 9621) 
but she is doing fine she was dating somebody i do not know whether they really got married or not you know because i do not really have that much communication with her but some guy younger than her i talked to him he seemed like a pretty decent guy 

Recording: (1614/ 9621) 
of course my wife is worked in higher education for 30 years so 

Recording: (1615/ 9621) 
she could not understand except the fact that you could just disagree with her it had to be because she was black or she was an older woman you could not just disagree had to be a reason there but fortunately she accused me of that in front of my boss who was black who did not believe it he knew better so 

Recording: (1616/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (1617/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (1618/ 9621) 
yeah they were troubled kids in the past they came from troubled backgrounds they did 

Recording: (1619/ 9621) 
until they start getting a little bit better equipment because the equipment is really ancient i mean there is stuff there that is older than i am but like port columbus is getting a new tower it is supposed to be done in about three and a half years and the equipment they are getting is all brand new stuff it is not like they are taking all the old junk we have got and moving it over there so that will help and nationwide they are also putting new stuff in but the bad part is picture your father is your father computer literate okay he is at his job and tomorrow morning they come in and they go everybody is gonna put all their work on computer well 

Recording: (1620/ 9621) 
um no actually now i live in hilliard 

Recording: (1621/ 9621) 
for alcohol like on your breath at all 

Recording: (1622/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1623/ 9621) 
because the problem with guns in my opinion is you do not have to think to use it it takes you know you do not have to sit there and load it in a split second i think we all are capable of shooting somebody for whatever reason you know just stupidity or whatnot just in a split second you know we might have that once in a life but we can kill somebody that quickly and you can not go oh you know 

Recording: (1624/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1625/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1626/ 9621) 
relations but they are normal people outside of their homosexuality i mean it is nothing different than regular parents 

Recording: (1627/ 9621) 
because they got beaches and yeah i do not think lake erie can compare that would hurt 

Recording: (1628/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (1629/ 9621)

to the art and tech department 

Recording: (1636/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1637/ 9621) 
you know and when i came back here i had moved to kentucky i came back here i would say 1973 

Recording: (1638/ 9621) 
well i think in general like let us say if you took a handful of executives from borden or att or someplace like that you would probably find that in general they are very concerned 

Recording: (1639/ 9621) 
i do not like busing i just do not i think it is kind of like you get what you pay for 

Recording: (1640/ 9621) 
yeah but just to see the church might be fun we about how many years ago seven or eight years ago decided to build a new worship center building and because we were really too big for the sanctuary that we had 

Recording: (1641/ 9621) 
good my son 

Recording: (1642/ 9621) 
well yeah me either 

Recording: (1643/ 9621) 
so that is all the required i am thinking about taking some extra anyway just because i like it 

Recording: (1644/ 9621) 
enough to satisfy me so that was good 

Recording: (1645/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (1646/ 9621) 
that would not bother me at all 

Recording: (1647/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1648/ 9621) 
so i spent the best six months of my life in new york 

Recording: (1649/ 9621) 
mmhmm for a year and i got hassled about my hair told me the only thing keeping me from moving up in the company was a pair of scissors 

Recording: (1650/ 9621) 
seen all the nice things just everywhere i could not believe it but now it is easy to take it for granted again just i am back home 

Recording: (1651/ 9621) 
which one is that 

Recording: (1652/ 9621) 
oh you have it is like man after i heard that i said that is not even worth calling i said they are gonna be rude 

Recording: (1653/ 9621) 
well i think at that age the parents should be involved and hopefully they will be openminded enough to know that this is going to be something she is going to have the rest of her life i will tell you what with today is world and some of these 14yearolds that look like they are 20 and you know they know what they are doing and no they should not keep repeating that i just think the most important thing is for them to be able to have the option i really do but yes the parents should be involved i would say to the age 17 maybe i think they should have a parent is consent and hopefully the parents will love their daughter enough to realize what a mistake it is going to be if she is going to be a young mother and then eventually maybe not even want to be a mother you know i mean there is a lot of girls that have those babies and then they just they kill them you know and there is so much of that for a while there that was going on and it is like i can not believe these women are doing this you know they just snap 

Recording: (1654/ 9621) 
but i had a note in before i had the heart attack i would already had two heart attacks i had a note in that i needed to be on first shift or i would probably have another heart attack and they would not put me on first shift then i had another heart attack put me in the hospital then i had another heart attack when i was in the hospital and when i came out that is when i gave them another note stating i needed to really be on first shift 

Recording: (1655/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1656/ 9621) 
and we called it the taj mahal because they would spilled bunches of information into it or bunches of money 

Recording: (1657/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1658/ 9621) 
oh hell yeah look at you man 

Recording: (1659/ 9621) 
well that is an interesting thing i am not in geology right now i am actually making more money right now in music than i am in geology but i am making most of my money in something that is irrelevant to most of my that has nothing to do with any of my studies yes i play principal horn in the symphony orchestra and last year i was in a professional singing group but i am also in a number of volunteer choirs the choir at the first unitarian universalist church in and a small choir where i work which i got the opportunity to conduct today because the conductor was not at work so i do a lot of music in my spare time mostly but unfortunately i did not get a job in geology and i do not have a fulltime job in music either either one of those would be nice but i 

Recording: (1660/ 9621) 
i remember you know we would like go to a pool hall or something you know a bar actually you know and it would be but we would play pool you know they would not let us drink or nothing because we were underage but that was basically the guys you know and the girls would go over to somebody is house you know and then we would meet up later on you know and go our separate ways or but driveins back then you know we get a movie mmhmm so as far as going shopping that was not really something that was a bigger thing i was maybe a saturday thing with mom and dad you know cuz they had the money you know hmm 

Recording: (1661/ 9621) 
you know i am just one of the kids hi mom you know and i guess it is true and i have always wondered you know i turned 18 i thought well should not i feel like an adult now you know i was 21 should not i start to feel like this responsible 25 should not i be an adult you know and i wonder at what point do you really feel like you are on that other side or you are one of the grownup people instead of one of the little people and maybe that is when 

Recording: (1662/ 9621) 
you know just experiencing someone for who they are and so she is 

Recording: (1663/ 9621)

Recording: (1664/ 9621) 
yeah harvey keitel 

Recording: (1665/ 9621)

Recording: (1666/ 9621) 
i mean now 

Recording: (1667/ 9621) 
they are trying it just does not seem like they are thinking ahead 

Recording: (1668/ 9621) 
and as a result like their kids my age and stuff like that that i have talked to i mean they have no idea what is going on 

Recording: (1669/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (1670/ 9621)

Recording: (1681/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1682/ 9621) 
that is funny 

Recording: (1683/ 9621) 
i think that the stories have not been some of my favorite lines from the simpsons are where they are highly critical one of my favorites is the one where bart thinks he loses his soul which in some ways is kind of preachy lisa takes other positions like whether the soul is real it does not matter da da da da but i love one scene whether cleaning out the barton milhouse are being punished they are cleaning out the pipes of the organs and the pipes of the organ and like bart is like there is no such thing as a soul milhouse is like why would they lie to us what would they have to gain and then it cuts to reverend lovejoy emptying the tip jars the donation thing into a little change counting machine like i do not hear cleaning what would they have to gain 

Recording: (1684/ 9621) 
definitely and it really makes you aware of your own mortality i mean things you see every day i mean you never know it could happen to anybody anytime just like that accident yesterday with um right

Recording: (1691/ 9621) 
my family and i will see them face to face and i will recognize them and they will recognize me but something transcends them because as i look to them unlike when they are on earth my goodness we are taught to learn the most negative thing about a person psychology says if you see a blank sheet of paper you the dot on the thing you do not see the other 99 of the paper you see that dot it is gonna be just the opposite in heaven i can not think of a negative thing about you and the reason why you can not think of a negative thing about them because you see christ is appearance comes through them

you know what kind of an answer is that even if your answer is i do not know why you can not do it it just makes me uncomfortable you know that is a lot more fair than because i am the boss of you or something like that and i think if you respect your kids and just kind of set boundaries with them you know kind of try to be i do not know that is the way my family is always been and it always seems to work really well for us 

Recording: (1728/ 9621) 
well it is good now well the web again has changed that computers have made a big difference it is more exciting now for people in that area who are interested it is more emphasis on information and not books and things going to the library is getting the information 

Recording: (1729/ 9621)

Recording: (1744/ 9621) 
he is a disappointment 

Recording: (1745/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (1746/ 9621) 
then that was always her main focus 

Recording: (1747/ 9621) 
i was living with my mom and like half and half like joint custody or whatever i was in with my mom and half with my dad and then when my dad moved to florida i moved with him and then my mom ended up getting remarried and like my dad had remarried by that time too and my mom remarried and they lived moved out to sunbury in like this house on five acres or whatever and so then when i came back i just lived with her up there 

Recording: (1748/ 9621) 
oh i know they do not care they got money people goddamn 

Recording: (1749/ 9621) 
is that where you got married 

Recording: (1750/ 9621) 
it is a very spiritual experience yes it gets hot in there how hot who knows but it is been such a strengthening spiritually strengthening thing it also physically purifies you by so much sweat that pours out of your body because of that heat it gets all the crap out of you 

Recording: (1751/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (1752/ 9621) 
and so he was in the hospital in japan for some time and then came home but he never would never say a lot about it 

Recording: (1753/ 9621) 
oh boy like action oh fight the bad guys yeah and now it is you know like looking and sort of postulating deeper meaning to what the characters have to go through using elements of the story as a metaphor for things in real life and the fact that it was something that did have such an effect on me as a child and upon our culture i think it is kind of interesting and now that it is coming back out i mean i look at things from a little different perspective but i mean yeah of the maybe i think i have done about 10 12 paintings of which i am like consider to be done and like 

Recording: (1754/ 9621) 
and i do not know if it is quite that bad but it was certainly some things that he is been doing that are not proved up and i am not real up on that 

Recording: (1755/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1756/ 9621) 
yeah like when i do the silk screening and this is kind of random but just anything 

Recording: (1757/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1758/ 9621) 
one of my best friends from high school and my boyfriend are both in it and they had bugged me about it forever to come and i am like i do not know about computers so they took me finally like december or something 

Recording: (1759/ 9621) 
of course with ours if you hit you did not have to hit them direct you could hit them right beside them and flip them over 

Recording: (1760/ 9621) 
they used to have a shelter house in the summer they held teen dances every weekend 

Recording: (1761/ 9621) 
maybe i should go back and get a degree in electrical engineering that would be a lot of fun 

Recording: (1762/ 9621) 
yeah i mean i tried and tried i just see it that he is not changing and you keep hoping you just keep hoping but it is all upon him and obviously he does not love me enough to really want to change and settle down he still wants to do those things he is doing and i just need to move on 

Recording: (1763/ 9621) 
and get some information 

Recording: (1764/ 9621) 
haha 

Recording: (1765/ 9621)

Recording: (1766/ 9621) 
if they can not say it in three months they can not say it in eight months 

Recording: (1767/ 9621)

Recording: (1768/ 9621)

Recording: (1772/ 9621) 
well my one friend went to a school in philadelphia for a while but she did not she went to a like a university arts which is a like a theater school and it was real like intense or whatever you know it is like double the workload of a normal college so she did not like that so she came back and was kind of in the same situation that i was like not really knowing what to do or whatever and then my one friend who we are living with he goes here he likes it i guess i do not know 

Recording: (1773/ 9621) 
sounds a lot like our dog 

Recording: (1774/ 9621) 
that is where we need to correct 

Recording: (1775/ 9621) 
mhm art 

Recording: (1776/ 9621)

Recording: (1777/ 9621)

Recording: (1778/ 9621) 
yes pets are 

Recording: (1779/ 9621) 
no i think i am perfectly content 

Recording: (1780/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1781/ 9621) 
yeah i am figuring middle of january is my guess school starts i think the 5th of january and then we are going to go that i do not know it is weird because i have had a job since i was 14 

Recording: (1782/ 9621) 
oh yeah they gave us $10000 here is $1 have fun 

Recording: (1783/ 9621) 
i grew up in cincinnati i went to school at rhode island school of design went east to school came back to got married and came back to cleveland lived there for a while met my husband hitchhiking back from school one year and then when he went to graduate school in columbus i came down here and do not have mr sturgill with us anymore but i stuck 

Recording: (1784/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (1785/ 9621) 
well i was born on a homestead out in northern montana and then my parents moved back to iowa which was their home area southern iowa and i grew up there attended high school there then i went to iowa state for five quarters and i just did not get it and then i worked around home for a year and then i went into the army in 1940 spring of 1941 before pearl harbor and i was in service for four and a half years in italy most of that time north africa and then italy and i had met a girl before i went into service and so when i got home we were married and she had family out here in columbus 

Recording: (1786/ 9621) 
but you can also grow with respect you can work with the community and still gain respect from the community and you will have allegiance but nowadays we do not have any loyalty at all it is out the window and that is why i fear the most you are saying on the internet eh yeah big deal you are going out there for what you want well maybe some people want low cost they do not want service ok boom disposable that is a problem we have in our society today because of one thing we are trying to communicate as you say through the internet and through businesses but we do not have compassion and we do not have commitment without those three you will never have success 

Recording: (1787/ 9621) 
i know 

Recording: (1788/ 9621) 
all right 

Recording: (1789/ 9621) 
well i mean as i mean like i was saying i he is at the ages where he needs to you know start learning things and she just does not do that and that is probably the way she raised her kids but no we have totally different opinions about everything 

Recording: (1790/ 9621) 
bye 

Recording: (1791/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (1792/ 9621) 
i was good in the interview i knew what i was doing i kind of wish i had not been as prepared but it was a lot of the people i moved into a management position it was a lateral move it was not even a pay raise or anything it was a lateral move and the people that i was supervising some of them had been doing it for 20 years and they made it very clear to me that they knew the program and i did not 

Recording: (1793/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (1794/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (1795/ 9621) 
neither one of us can remember it so i do not know 

Recording: (1796/ 9621) 
than would be with the black president and i think it would cause problems i do not know if anything real violent or anything would occur from it but i definitely could see here definitely would think that people would be arguing about it yelling about it and making a bigger deal about it 

Recording: (1797/ 9621) 
is that right 

Recording: (1798/ 9621) 
well because i have been in public schools all my life and i should be the first to know that there is a lot of favoritism some teachers will teach one but not teach the other 

Recording: (1799/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (1800/ 9621) 
all of them the university is divided up in different areas and there is a shop within each area that takes care of all the maintenance needs for those areas usually there are about 20 buildings or so ours is in the northeast area from wexner down through the oval to i do not know about derby or so around in there and then on over to woodruff 

Recording: (1801/ 9621) 
yeah but i have got more influence i think maybe i am not sure i am hoping i have got more influence over him than his father does 

Recording: (1802/ 9621) 
they wrote a song probably their most famous one it was called green grass and high times forever i do not know if that was what it was called 

Recording: (1803/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1804/ 9621) 
and i was trying to do everything and then also too they wanted me to go to therapy 

Recording: (1805/ 9621) 
be exciting 

Recording: (1806/ 9621) 
his mom was june cleaver 

Recording: (1807/ 9621) 
yeah because my friend has some place where she even teaches yoga and has she is real involved in it she goes to the one i told you was the realtor but i should find out where that studio is if i find out i will let you know because i know she goes to some place called kripalu in pennsylvania from time to time and who knows i just i do not really do it for the meditation or anything 

Recording: (1808/ 9621) 
exactly 

Recording: (1809/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1810/ 9621) 
was six normal kids because ld kids would be creative and they would think of ways to get out of there and the normal kids would sit and cry 

Recording: (1811/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1812/ 9621) 
when you go over there and you see people begging for a can of beans 

Recording: (1813/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1814/ 9621) 
oh really 

Recording: (1815/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1816/ 9621) 
it sure works for me 

Recording: (1817/ 9621) 
he is an educator which is all the more reason to homeschool because he sees it and he is like yeah they 

Recording: (1818/ 9621) 
well he is polite i will give him that much 

Recording: (1819/ 9621) 
that is our planet 

Recording: (1820/ 9621) 
oh gosh a whole lot more people 

Recording: (1821/ 9621) 
it is not that i would not keep talking but you probably sort of have a limited yeah 

Recording: (1822/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1823/ 9621) 
i am hoping that will be the same experience as it is in ohio state 

Recording: (1824/ 9621) 
which one are you talking about 

Recording: (1825/ 9621) 
and i just thought i just do not like this is this something that when i look long term is this something that i want to deal with for the rest of my life and i said no it just is not and i think that you have to look at and see if you are compatible with somebody before people get into situations and they marry people that you just from the outside you can look and you can think are you nuts that is never going to work so i think that you just kind of have to take you know are you compatible do you really feel like this is something that is going to work and be positive i do not know if i am old enough to do anything yet 

Recording: (1826/ 9621) 
so it probably was not unexpected we just were not prepared for it i do not think you could be prepared for it 

Recording: (1827/ 9621) 
mm 

Recording: (1828/ 9621) 
and nothing happens over here yeah 

Recording: (1829/ 9621) 
basically last time i heard he was doing lawn care he is done about everything like i told him you know get as many jobs as you can till you figure out what you want to do he is done maintenance work he is done sales work i say he is doing lawn care now he is done gardening his girlfriend they live together he is not married like i said he a kid they have been together for about four years but a lot of times he will work for her dad 

Recording: (1830/ 9621) 
just like almost out of control 

Recording: (1831/ 9621) 
that is my dad has red hair and blue eyes so 

Recording: (1832/ 9621) 
yes i will go back to fulltime most definitely when he is in school if i could find something parttime that pays more that is what i am looking for to do 

Recording: (1833/ 9621) 
it is been a lot of problems with him he is a brilliant kid they told us in elementary school he had the highest iq they would ever had tested he is very creative very talented musically he was taking lessons from gene walker that teaches jazz saxophone here at the university and he said that he thought charlie had the makings to be a professional make a living career as a jazz saxophonist but there is also in the last four years or so a lot of mental health problems 

Recording: (1834/ 9621) 
uh huh 

Recording: (1835/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1836/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1837/ 9621) 
i like to try new recipes i do like to do that but i do not think that i do a lot of real european cuisine necessarily but i do look at recipes and enjoy eating the food too 

Recording: (1838/ 9621) 
i make little side bets not necessarily money you know just haha for fun sometimes i did get money for it though it was not too bad i mean you know it is not like some kind of racketeering deal 

Recording: (1839/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1840/ 9621) 
hmm 

Recording: (1841/ 9621) 
i will start asking you questions 

Recording: (1842/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (1843/ 9621) 
meanwhile i stay in columbus with dad 

Recording: (1844/ 9621) 
mmhmm except for a year and a half i lived in russia but that is different 

Recording: (1845/ 9621) 
some of them just look like you know cracker back box houses that you know they put up in a week or something it is amazing how you can drive by and then in two weeks drive by and there is 50 homes because there is a lot of growth in hilliard hilliard is that is starting to scare us actually a little bit because now they just built another whole high school two whole high schools i think they were up to 2 or 3000 senior graduates last year 

Recording: (1846/ 9621) 
and that was strictly nono 

Recording: (1847/ 9621) 
it was more fun without being on 

Recording: (1848/ 9621) 
then when you started to talk about homosexuality it would be easier to it would be easier for the kids to see that they are just people you know 

Recording: (1849/ 9621) 
i 

Recording: (1850/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (1851/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1852/ 9621) 
i had french in the sixth grade and i got a is i had german and spanish in the seventh grade and then in the eighth grade i had french in the ninth grade i had french in the tenth grade i had french and my junior year of high school i had french and my grades went b is straight b is c is straight c is d is straight d is and i said i think i should get out now and i stopped taking it i didn did not take french my senior year but then the arts and sciences came around and said you will have a foreign language requirement i am like well i already know all this french i might as well take some more french and a firstyear freshman year of french yeah it was not fun my second year sophomore i started in for another year of french and about three quarters away through the year i realized that every day was all about dreading french class before and after i would spend all up to french class going no no french class and all after french class going god that was so miserable i was like this is stupid this is no way to live my life so i went to my counselor and i said no french class that is how it is going to be so you need to figure out how i am not going to end up taking french well you have to take a french class you have to she was like no do not have to take a french class 

Recording: (1853/ 9621) 
right like magazines 

Recording: (1854/ 9621) 
is that right they are not interested in seeing the sides or seeing the well maybe they are but it is like as a secondary agenda 

Recording: (1855/ 9621) 
our janitor is worthless basically we were complaining about it earlier during the year three formal complaints have been filed against him and he still refuses to change the bleach water more than once a week it is just really disgusting so we had these temps come in one day and we were in shock it was so clean 

Recording: (1856/ 9621) 
i got a friend of mine that graduated from purdue university of indiana or something like that i think that is what it was i said pu pu university 

Recording: (1857/ 9621) 
but since all the moms have gone to work and let the tv become the electronic babysitter and the other thing that is happening is kids do not know things now that you would expect them to know like because their moms are not reading to them like they do not know who winnie the pooh is 

Recording: (1858/ 9621) 
and i was glad i realized that nobody would ever mess with my children not even their father my husband or whatever 

Recording: (1859/ 9621) 
everybody gets something 

Recording: (1860/ 9621) 
one of my kids got it for me 

Recording: (1861/ 9621) 
and they are also talking about because the actors the reason they are ending it is because the actors do not want to do it there was talk i do not know if they are still pursuing this that they would have new characters take over the roles and i mean the character development is the most important part i think so i think that will be a failure but that also sort of tells me that they are going to leave things kind of open 

Recording: (1862/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1863/ 9621) 
oh okay okay yeah as far as the siblings go bernie does charitable work 

Recording: (1864/ 9621)

Recording: (1897/ 9621) 
well yeah he does back down too often i think well the health insurance did not have a chance i mean no matter what position he took on the health insurance trying to radically change things it was not going to get through congress and so yeah he backed down but i would have liked to have seen something else happen to it but it was also i mean he gave up because it was useless to fight it it was not going to get through congress so why spin your wheels on that i mean he raised the issue it was clear that it was not going to go anywhere and maybe it will i think it is regrettable it has not come back yeah but he is pretty much out of the picture now as of this week the gays in the military they have always been there really they have always been there i do not have problems being around gays i never have i have a brotherinlaw who is gay my son is godfather is gay it is not a problem

Recording: (1955/ 9621) 
years 

Recording: (1956/ 9621) 
so it brings that down and it is like you know they are not comparing it fairly if you would take all the people who are making the same score on the test at both schools i will bet you they are all about the same 

Recording: (1957/ 9621) 
yeah it is 

Recording: (1958/ 9621)

Recording: (1959/ 9621) 
predominantly i like i like playing i like puzzles i like challenges i do not like to accept puzzles i like anything that involves fixing it i do not mind breaking things either because then you have something to fix afterwards made me a very bad latchkey child 

Recording: (1960/ 9621) 
well he was not really diagnosed then until just the last couple years and part of the problem was it was fairly new and everybody was being diagnosed adhd and it was not really there were not really good screening instruments for it there are now and we have often felt that he needed to have gifted emphasis for gifted children and the schools would not do that for him because his grades were not good enough because he did not do the work 

Recording: (1961/ 9621) 
he is a businessman 

Recording: (1962/ 9621) 
tennessee they are even friendlier in some places

Recording: (1964/ 9621) 
ok dripping down 

Recording: (1965/ 9621)

yeah 

Recording: (1967/ 9621) 
she figures well you know that kind of makes up for me not working 

Recording: (1968/ 9621)

and have the two daughters 

Recording: (1980/ 9621) 
and they were in italy and europe and there was not the definite enemy in vietnam that there was in europe i think that is part of it and of course the attitude of most of the guys that went to vietnam was a little bit different from where i was probably as a consequence of our understanding of the 

Recording: (1981/ 9621) 
maybe it is crime is going down in the sense that it is applying you know it is criminals are not as active but there is more and more of these acts of violence and maybe it is because they are so dramatic did you notice it 

Recording: (1982/ 9621) 
not that i know of none of the other sports teams were so inclined to like push their athletes to cut weight 

Recording: (1983/ 9621) 
yeah you gotta remember it was all swamps back when i was a kid like i said i grew up down here it was mostly farmlands when i grew up around here 

Recording: (1984/ 9621)

he is the one jelling in their house and he is the one cursing and causing all the ruckus 

Recording: (1990/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1991/ 9621) 
but it is parents that fight for the society and what is in your community you know the parents for each individual child they have to all form together as a group and almost be parents to all these kids as a group you know it is not you can be the best parent in the world at home and then your kid goes to school and it accesses the computer or they get in a group of kids where their parents they do not even know where they are it is the kids responsibility to get and go to school maybe the mom and dad did not even come home the night before but there is all different kinds of situations so i think it does start with the parents because they need to be aware of what all the kids are being shown and have access to 

Recording: (1992/ 9621) 
oh yes 

Recording: (1993/ 9621) 
that is just it is ridiculous 

Recording: (1994/ 9621) 
i think she will end up coming here anyway 

Recording: (1995/ 9621) 
yes have not they talked about that here actually have they talked about 

Recording: (1996/ 9621) 
yeah so you know i felt like you know the polaris mall would benefit columbus and all the way around you know as far as you know what was going on with that jacobs coming here and running all that advertising about northland mall and everything i can understand you know the residents of northland wanting their mall to remain but i did not feel like you know that had anything to do with polaris being built 

Recording: (1997/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (1998/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1999/ 9621) 
yeah yeah they all have there is actually other systems too and they all have pretty much the same look but it is just that there is little details that are different 

Recording: (2000/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (2001/ 9621) 
ha ha ha ha 

Recording: (2002/ 9621) 
i would say of i think the vva generally sees on the average 5 7 10 something like that a day and not all of them homeless 

Recording: (2003/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2004/ 9621) 
i think that there should be a mandatory because you have it in big companies you have mandatory sexual harassment tapes and you learn you teach the girls that it is not what they do it is how they make you feel is constituted as your harassment there and they are too afraid and then besides that there is crushes on you can not fault the girls for having crushes and things like that they are going through enough things as it is 

Recording: (2005/ 9621) 
almost the minority it was a pretty even it was a low income neighborhood and when i was in seventh grade i remember going home and saying was everybody the same and being told well of course they are so i went to school and told everybody i was in love with danny flowers who happened to be black and i got called into the office and they called in a social worker and i was punished i was not allowed to i was grounded for the year and they never called this kid in then i thought this whole thing is so screwed up what is wrong with these people they kept saying that they wanted to save this nice white girl because i had so much potential and they were not gonna let me throw my life away like this it is bizarre and so i was always from that time on i decided these people are all crazy i am never to be like that and so i have a whole lot of different values from my family and it is real hard for them because all my other siblings who are younger are willing to 

Recording: (2006/ 9621) 
aww that is nice 

Recording: (2007/ 9621) 
oh yeah yeah 

Recording: (2008/ 9621) 
yes it is definitely having an effect on children and the schools are trying to catch up or make up for it but they are not doing it yet whether they will be able to pick up enough by changing the way they teach and so on in the next 20 years i do not know but i am glad my children went to school when they did and i stayed home with them 

Recording: (2009/ 9621) 
super 

Recording: (2010/ 9621) 
yeah if it is a nice day on the weekends i 

Recording: (2011/ 9621) 
check this out and then he will let go and fall on his butt it is kind of funny 

Recording: (2012/ 9621) 
there is like people calling and talk about other like they saw it in this other our mailorder catalog that i have never heard of either it is i do not know how really they do it like it is just like they get people is names and stuff from credit card companies and then mail them out things and people call back or whatever 

Recording: (2013/ 9621) 
somewhat 

Recording: (2014/ 9621) 
like you know 

Recording: (2015/ 9621) 
jetzt geht ron rein 

Recording: (2016/ 9621) 
laughs 

Recording: (2017/ 9621) 
what his background really was 

Recording: (2018/ 9621) 
yeah i graduated from athens high school enrolled in the ou for the winter quarter and pursued a part of that 

Recording: (2019/ 9621) 
yeah it was very hard for me to stay in school i could have easily quit like that because the teachers did not i went to a columbus public school and they did not care i mean i went through elementary and middle school with straight as and bs and got there and i was on cs to ds you know and it just was really the teachers did not care you know if you learn you learn if you do not you do not if you do not come to school you do not come to school you do not they do not care that was how my school was so i am there what i do not there was nothing there that really i can remember that did anything good for me i mean i think middle school taught me a lot more than high school 

Recording: (2020/ 9621) 
there not as many of them or you mean because 

Recording: (2021/ 9621) 
ha ha ha 

Recording: (2022/ 9621) 
and she is taken very good care of herself she is followed all the doctor is orders and she is very careful what she eats 

Recording: (2023/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (2024/ 9621) 
i live up north around carl and morse road 

Recording: (2025/ 9621) 
heh 

Recording: (2026/ 9621) 
but it is not gonna work i mean if you are around people i mean number one they are around their parents and their siblings and that is socialization you go to church or to the library or wherever i mean you are around people and you are around children and they get to have socialization if you wanna call it whatever and i think from everything that i have read and seen that they get the socialization that they need at home and they are not relying so much on their peers and their peers opinions because i for one example the pokemon craze my son did not know what pokemon was until he heard some other kids talking about it and you know it is just like stuff like that it is just like they do not they do not know what half of that stuff is unless some other kid is pushing it in their face you know and then even still they are just like oh it is cool because everybody else likes it they do not really know what it is or what it is about i mean you know what i mean because it is like they just blow up each other or whatever it is like really what is the point to the whole thing and he did not know what it was until he heard some other kids talking about it oh he must be cool because some other kids are talking about it but then he decided that it was not cool so that was my influence our influence on him rather than the peers influence on him 

Recording: (2027/ 9621) 
it is grace brethren christian middle school it is part of worthington school it is because they annexed it 

Recording: (2028/ 9621) 
i get a bs which they mail to me after first year of medical school they figure that gross anatomy and all that is enough 

Recording: (2029/ 9621) 
yeah that seems good 

Recording: (2030/ 9621) 
mmhmm yeah 

Recording: (2031/ 9621) 
uh i do not know 

Recording: (2032/ 9621) 
he seemed to confuse parenting with controlling 

Recording: (2033/ 9621) 
so i am not going to get too much of an attitude from people 

Recording: (2034/ 9621) 
i think it is important to know what the person is values and customs are and to support whatever it is i mean we have done some wild things over there but i mean we have changed rooms around beds around positions of how beds needed to be placed in order that they needed to face the north star or they needed to have this thing above the bed or under the bed i mean if it is important for them to have prayer then i think it is important to get the appropriate people over and encourage them to have whatever it is they need 

Recording: (2035/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (2036/ 9621) 
and i do not really think it is something that needs to be taught the only thing probably is like what do they call that cultural diversity or whatever classes they have us take i think that i do not think is such a bad idea because just because you grew up in i do not know what i grew up in but i will give an example i did not grow up in let is say somebody goes hunting and fishing and drives trucks and wears ball caps and listens to country music does not mean if somebody does not do that they are not okay i think that would be a good idea or you know cultures are all different so if you wanted to view that as a culture or do you know what i mean that that is something different except the people you do not have to like what they are doing but they are still people 

Recording: (2037/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (2038/ 9621) 
heh heh 

Recording: (2039/ 9621) 
do you see i do not care at all about tr i do not even drive 

Recording: (2040/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (2041/ 9621) 
and i would just hear things 

Recording: (2042/ 9621) 
well i do not think it is really alternative 

Recording: (2043/ 9621) 
she was alleging that students were writing racial slurs on their desks and stuff but i had friends in classes of hers and none of them wrote any 

Recording: (2044/ 9621) 
i figure that would be plenty i told my mom i just want green jello she said you did not make me snacks 

Recording: (2045/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2046/ 9621) 
and you could actually walk out and take a picture of it over there now in port columbus you could not do that but you could over there because you can walk around on the ramp over there at osu 

Recording: (2047/ 9621)

Recording: (2048/ 9621)

Recording: (2054/ 9621) 
she does not have to be wearing that tight outfit i think that is for ratings i really do think it is for ratings

Recording: (2058/ 9621) 
so i do not know whether he had a boat or anyway there was a boat available to him and he rode across the island 

Recording: (2059/ 9621) 
that is certainly possible there are lots of ways that my brain does not work the ways that other people is do so i think i think a lot of it too has to do with being comfortable with yourself and knowing you know i mean i have gotten so much better over the years i was very i have always been real a lot more temperamental we always joke you know that that predictable and some of those things are not even temperate or not things you would use to describe me but not in a negative way you know i just think that as i have gotten older too i have been able to see things and not be so get so concerned about things that really were not that important anymore 

Recording: (2060/ 9621) 
16 years old mom and dad split up 

Recording: (2061/ 9621)

Recording: (2066/ 9621) 
reader is digest used to write their digest on the eighth grade level they now write it on the sixth grade level newspapers are written between fifth and sixth grade level for the general public it is just either we are getting more and more ld kids that are not learning to read or kids are just not as motivated because of video games and things that well i read one article that said that because kids sit in front of a television set from the time they are born until they are five when they come to kindergarten they do not want to participate they want to sit back and be entertained and they are expecting you to do all this stuff and they are just going to watch 

Recording: (2067/ 9621)

i am just gonna sit down like this 

Recording: (2071/ 9621) 
okay let us go 

Recording: (2072/ 9621) 
break it off because i did not think that was fair i think anymore though with the women are more powerful and i think they they are finally making you know good money and used to be women needed men to take care of them and they were not as much in the workforce you know i think things have changed really in the last 10 years you know in the 80s still yes you know there was definitely a point in my life where i was like oh am i ever gonna meet anybody and all my friends honestly most of them were all married but i enjoyed being single and i never really felt the urge just to get married to get married and i am glad of that 

Recording: (2073/ 9621) 
oh yeah i was ready oh yeah 

Recording: (2074/ 9621) 
the twoparter last season where it was they advertised as full disclosure

it i do not know makes our generation sound like heroes 

Recording: (2077/ 9621) 
but you guys the thing is just you have all these people and you got to keep their attention for like an hour or two 

Recording: (2078/ 9621) 
yeah it is true i had janssen and i you know that was of course i went to art school so janssen was just in case you had to look something up it was there our lecturers were all pretty liberal so that you know the art history we got was different than what would just be in janssen so i never thought about that but 

Recording: (2079/ 9621) 
we are not sure we are looking to we rent now and we are looking to buy a house 

Recording: (2080/ 9621) 
yeah we are getting impatient and we are getting it is sort of like you know the pendulum will swing back the other way eventually maybe 30 years from now there will be kids will be you know in this country will be learning more than they ever have but right now i think we are really not doing justice to the curriculum and i say to my friends i say teach these kids well because they are going to be running the country in our old age we will be sitting in a rocking chair and they will be running the country so you better teach them well when you look at it like that 

Recording: (2081/ 9621) 
so i do not know where to go to me the biggest thing would be if they get rid of these saturday night special guns and stuff like that 

Recording: (2082/ 9621)

Recording: (2102/ 9621)

Recording: (2103/ 9621) 
we do not necessarily overcome bed by bed we are still very much in that framework of reference on this particular planet

there is no concept behind it you are right you are right to some degree the area commissions are supposed to work on that and help unify i used to be on the university area commission in the campus area and that is one of the things we work on although some of the other commissions in columbus are almost strictly architectural they only talk about the kinds of buildings people can build and in the university area commission we dealt with that we dealt with zoning whether something would be commercial or multifamily residence we dealt with parking yeah a lot yeah yeah 

Recording: (2110/ 9621) 
you hitting on me get the hell away

it was difficult i can not tell you how many times he had papers or projects due at school that we just have to sit there with him to keep him focused on doing it one of the diagnoses is probably adhd which he has trouble with a working memory on how to get a project done and stuff like that we taught him how to do timelines and gantt charts and things like that but it was very difficult for him to be taskoriented 

Recording: (2112/ 9621) 
it was fantastic 

Recording: (2113/ 9621) 
mmmm unless you know his dad was totally gone but he is been there ever since you know i was pregnant all through my pregnancy and he is been there for this whole two years i would not do that to him 

Recording: (2114/ 9621) 
you know and that worked out well but i think too like with my school schedule you know if i am just in class maybe you know three four days a week and then the rest of the time in the evening jason will be there so it is not like i am relying on her every single day all the time to do that and i really would not want to put my child in daycare 

Recording: (2115/ 9621) 
and they seem like random or just spontaneous there is nothing you can do in life to really avoid it except hide hide in your basement or something 

Recording: (2116/ 9621) 
i love it

i do believe that in some cases the parents or the responsible adult should be found guilty of that 

Recording: (2122/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2123/ 9621) 
and i am going to hold you to this confidentiality because very few people know about this 

Recording: (2124/ 9621) 
you know whatever is going on i always have to have a backup plan though and then i know well if this happens this will work and if this does not happen this way then this is what we will do instead 

Recording: (2125/ 9621) 
in the us 

Recording: (2126/ 9621) 
i said well it did not spell vestibules wrong but i doubt if your animal eats parts of buildings 

Recording: (2127/ 9621)

Recording: (2143/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (2144/ 9621) 
you have got to have the leadership you have got to have the right people to have this school structured properly and the people with the right credentials for the job and i am telling you some of these principals that i have dealt with were highly overpaid as far as i was concerned for what they were doing one principal from my daughter is high school he was out partying all the time he was riding around in a corvette and he tried to take me out 

Recording: (2145/ 9621) 
crazy

Recording: (2154/ 9621) 
30 40000 it is international yeah 

Recording: (2155/ 9621) 
well i felt that you know polaris mall would be good for the city even though i want you know northland mall to stay there that would seem to be the big issue you know with northland mall 

Recording: (2156/ 9621) 
i think that basically that is in a nutshell they have reached a point in their life where you know they are cowards as far as going out and killing themselves but they want to kill themselves slowly by drinking themselves to death or smoking you know whatever you know smoking crack or whatever and then just living in the hell i mean 

Recording: (2157/ 9621) 
you are warming up 

Recording: (2158/ 9621) 
i think so i think so if you are willing you know anybody who is willing to put out the effort i mean you do have to you know you have to sell yourself there is you know you are not going to just sit around and wait to be discovered but if you put out the effort i really do not i do not think there is that kind of that kind of discrimination anymore 

Recording: (2159/ 9621) 
well my husband was allergic when we first got together but i have to admit he has other allergies so he gets shots and things but they always say it is the pet dander

Recording: (2161/ 9621) 
we try and teach and expand people is knowledge so that when they go out and they talk to someone about christ they do not have that blank look on their face when the person asks them something somebody asks them something and they are like i do not know or they actually have an answer and if they do not know they will say i do not know but i can find out for you if you are willing to if you are willing to give me the time to go find out i do not know the hardest 

Recording: (2162/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2163/ 9621) 
yeah they got me one time for cutting zero period and the principal is was having me sit in the office during zero period to serve detention so if you could tell me how they can get me for cutting class when they ordered me to sit in the principal is office i could figure that one out too 

Recording: (2164/ 9621)

is it hard for you to teach him as well as take care of the younger child minor thing and i feel like i am just in a kind of a phase if you will it is you know because there will be grown up in a blink of an eye so if i i mean if i put my career or whatever on hold it is going to be worth it in the long run when my kids are grown up and they can be like yeah mom was there they taught mom and dad taught us all of our life application skills that we need to know now and i think that that will be better in the long run for them and that is the responsibility i took on as being a parent so that is my job even though it is mundane and monotonous at times 

Recording: (2182/ 9621) 
yeah well there was not even an opportunity for me to try and think of ways to say it there was nothing there there was no ability to communicate he needs to know this piece of information at the same time there is no way i could tell it to him so yeah so i am yeah you do not know and there was nothing else to do about it and continue on merrily and he said eventually he said it was sometime later when i actually found out what was going on i said i had some suspicions because you can do a quick party count and figure out who is not there and assume something bad has happened but he said but it was a while before i found out actually so we can stop the story here we can go on because the story it is a fun story 

Recording: (2183/ 9621) 
yeah that is how he gets so much money he says i will be paid this much and i will be given this much minimum per day or i am not working for you and they usually say no no no we will not do that and then they will call back a week later ok we will take you he has some really good stories about that oh yeah so what he just has qualifications with running businesses is that why he has qualifications with businesses and also with unix which is

Recording: (2188/ 9621) 
yeah i mean you know signing oh here you go hon the one i think is pretty obvious that the blind eye was something that should not have happened the other one that yeah you just let us face it at that age and at every age we want a leader and i guess it goes back if we choose to or we know how to make better decisions for ourselves we will make better decisions of who is going to lead us so i do not know i think a lot of it is the family unit breaking down in general you know and secondly i think to be honest i think the media has gotten a little carried away they sensationalize it and i do think you know they know they are gonna get recognized they are gonna have their name go down in history unfortunately i think that has something to do with it too it is frustrating to turn on the news they do not really cover my husband comes from a journalistic background and he will be like that is not news you know it is just we get so let us sit here and watch a plane crash for 12 hours instead of watching i do not know what little house on the prairie i do not know i am being facetious but you know what i mean

car accident i would say about 10 years ago 

Recording: (2198/ 9621) 
yes yes and that is i am geared towards you know people with mental illness you know they have diagnosed me with bipolar but you know my neurologist says the bipolar was just a chemical imbalance as a result of the brain injury spiritual leaders have told me that it is a spiritual imbalance there is really no chemical thing there the problem is both physical mental and spiritual but the majority of the problem is spiritual and when you talk to people that know that 

Recording: (2199/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (2200/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2201/ 9621)

just throw that into being sure you are relaxed enough 

Recording: (2234/ 9621) 
not really a national system it is already been put to national if they rate them state to state and city to city but on the level of the actual needs of the student you can not just put down a book and say i want you to put 500 words on this page why you like this or dislike this book i mean one person can do it and another one i mean you could probably write about a thousand words on a page right now about psychology because of your how many years you have two three 

Recording: (2235/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2236/ 9621)

all the politicians all right take the governor or take the president of the united states they can want something this way but then they have got the senate and all these other committees down below them that if they overrule him what good does he you know what can he do really so i mean no matter what he promises and you are voting him in there for what he is promising you but if he can not succeed in getting these other guys to back him up there they went 

Recording: (2283/ 9621) 
period and it is a long process i mean this has been going on for 200 years this way and people are suspicious of government asking questions 

Recording: (2284/ 9621) 
i do not know i would not personally think that the parent should be held responsible i mean they do have a certain amount of responsibility for the fact that they should have been more aware and especially because i mean i believe that those at least one of the two had been in counseling and was doing aggression management or something like that you would think that if they were going through something like that you would just sort of you know maybe keep a closer eye on what they were doing so i think you know to that degree you know the parents should have you know were sort of responsible and also with like their kids disposition i mean you know would you not notice some difference if something like that was going to happen i mean depending on you know how well they hit it or whatever but i think at that point though you are you are so influenced by your peers 

Recording: (2285/ 9621) 
so i became a proud business major 

Recording: (2286/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (2287/ 9621) 
casting off authority and that kind of stuff it was about someone making a bad choice gaining power because of it and then ultimately seeing the folly of the ways and dying in the classic tragic hero sort of way and so i am looking forward to how they build up to that point a lot of people when i was in high school they are like what the hell are you talking about beau but yeah i am looking forward to seeing how things come about 

Recording: (2288/ 9621) 
must have 

Recording: (2289/ 9621)

mmhmm 

Recording: (2294/ 9621) 
as a teacher how could you cut down on students and say no that is not the way it was and you are learning from the teacher is guide no but how do you know without asking the person but it is a matter of tradition and handing it down to the tradition itself it is a matter of having in your family what did your parents think of this way and that way and it is not necessarily written down but it is passed on in those days probably written down or not written not written down but verbal and extended and so it is that hand down from generations 

Recording: (2295/ 9621) 
i am living here all my life i do not like it i like the old cow town they can call it what they want it was easy to get around you never had any traffic you do not sit on the freeway like you do now now it is like you do not want to go out at four oclock you just do not want to get involved in it so i do not know growth is good but i guess i am not into it as much as a lot of other people it is good for the economy but it is just amazing all the every time you turn around they are plopping two 400 home unit developments up here and there i am just thinking where are these people all coming from you just can not imagine where would these people all move from this is getting scary yeah what is the big draw you know and you know you still see you know when they opened up a lone star steak near our house they could not even do lunch because they did not have the people i think so you know that it is people are just dying for people to work out there

Recording: (2312/ 9621) 
i think they need to educate me on what is important to them and i will honor and respect as much as i can but even people within different i mean a catholic is not a catholic in my opinion i mean there is some old time catholics i my mom that are very strict catholics by the old rules before the vatican i think there is a new modern age of catholics so even if you say i am jewish or i am gay or i am african american or whatever i varying they are still a person with different needs and wants and what their traditions and culture and family values are are still going to be very different and you need to find out from that individual person what it is that they need 

Recording: (2313/ 9621)

but i really enjoy them 

Recording: (2388/ 9621) 
i can not really take her with you yeah you can not get her in you have to be 18 to get into dance clubs now but those are the two really really really tough ones that a lot of people will throw at you when you are trying to share things with them but there is whole lists of them and it is just a matter of i mean i am getting myself to a point where i can go out and share my faith with other people i do not think i am ready to because one of the biggest problems is like i mentioned with the brother jed thing is undoing the damage other people have done and i do not have enough knowledge up here to really go out and be like a campus preacher i will share my faith with people that i am really close to like coemployees and other people that i am in if somebody gets real close to me in a class eventually i will share with them but if i am in a lecture hall i am not gonna jump up and start hollering about my faith do you think there is a place and a time for doing certain things this is one of the biggest things that people use as a reason for faith faith is something that people do not understand i do not even understand it i use it as an answer for a lot of questions that i do not have answers for it is faith and that is what religion is religion is faith every religion has to have faith you have to believe that what you are doing and what you are believing in is right you know whether everyone else in the world thinks it is or not you have to believe it is or you being part of that religion has absolutely no meaning and that is an answer that a lot of people do not like to hear and you know like i have walked down like high street before and gotten this urge this feeling to just share my faith with certain people on the sidewalks like i shared my faith a little while ago with some street bums and they were real receptive i do not know if they were drunk but they were real receptive i do not know if they really understood what i was saying but i felt led to talk to them and that is what i believe my faith is my faith is faith it is believing that things happen that you can not explain it is believing that you are doing what you are doing is right so religion is a real big part of my life 

Recording: (2389/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (2390/ 9621) 
hmm 

Recording: (2391/ 9621)

Recording: (2393/ 9621) 
people want a number they do not want to know the methodology that goes into it or the disclaimers or the footnotes they do not want to read the footnotes they want a number when i worked for the state one program i worked on was occupational employment statistics which was collecting numbers of employees by different occupations in different industries in different areas of ohio which actually originally started here at the university of ohio it was a federal program department of labor it was administered at the state level and it did not turn out very well so they switched it over to me for a variety of reasons which was not entirely the university is fault they had to rely on confidential information which we could not give them because it was confidential by federal law it was confidential we could not give it to them but they needed it so it was just not a good way to do business and we would present information okay there is this number of people in an occupation but there was also a range of error on there well people would not notice that and they would take that number as gospel and you just could not convince them that well it really means more than that the big one would be wage levels and we did not really at that time collect wage data so we were kind of a conduit for there is several different departments in the state in the federal government that collect occupational data and we were kind of a conduit for the state for that people they wanted an hourly rate they did not want a range they wanted a number and that was gospel but it is based on survey data and there is always statistical error in there and stuff and try to explain that we spent more time when people call and give information explaining this is what this really means than just giving them the number we spent more time doing that 

Recording: (2394/ 9621) 
convenient 

Recording: (2395/ 9621)

Recording: (2401/ 9621) 
i can not really see a problem with it but like i said if he is going around picking fights things like that then i can not say i would support anyone like that 

Recording: (2402/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (2403/ 9621) 
yeah why not take advantage of this yeah why not take advantage of that 

Recording: (2404/ 9621) 
yeah and i had sold with it well i waited i knew that what had to happen on the outside which is really only some paint a minor painting painting the columns and adding shutters and cleaning up the front yard and then we have there is a guy who works for me who is i just do not know how i can have how he makes a living because he is very very reasonable he is also very loyal to me he is done stuff for me for years and and he is not that old he is probably 28 or 29 now but anyhow pat went in we added a bathroom there was a mudroom we added a half bath off the kitchen and we put in change the back door and put in the deck and he did those kinds of things and you know and then we were ready to go and i said i was gonna sell it myself and everybody said i was crazy and i had an open house and i sold it that day i had 30 i had like 30 some people in i got my offer that afternoon i got what i wanted well i did not get it immediately the realtors told me i should ask 134 and i asked 146 instead because i really felt i i knew that this was a nice house and i knew i had beautiful hardwood floors building bookcases and i just knew that i could have seen me wanting that house and you know what i mean it is like that identity thing and so somebody came through with the realtor and they made me this offer that was real low it was like $138 and the realtor i am thinking about it because it was funny he delivered the offer to my home and i was gracious and i thanked him and i got inside and i opened up and i saw it and i went running on the porch i said wait a minute this is never gonna work 

Recording: (2405/ 9621) 
they will not increase until the tax law revises itself again to up the deduction allowances because even when we reduced deductions it went down too and then again you say well maybe some affluent person would donate and it is publicized

Recording: (2407/ 9621) 
everybody is living longer everybody is there is more medical things where people get can be healed from things that they could not be healed from so everybody today is living basically as today is their future where back 30 years ago i mean when i was a kid you know i mean i was not really thinking about today i mean i was thinking about tomorrow 

Recording: (2408/ 9621) 
and for just a poor little wife and a small baby on that was kind of tough going 

Recording: (2409/ 9621) 
yeah it is a qualitative type analysis 

Recording: (2410/ 9621) 
i am sorry 

Recording: (2411/ 9621) 
i did not see that part i missed that beginning all i seen was the chart and i was like whoa that is one reason why i would hesitate to put my kid in the columbus public just like the daycare 

Recording: (2412/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (2413/ 9621) 
yeah i mean you do not want to see the chain gangs with the people whipping them i mean that is not right either but yeah i am not for the weight rooms because like they said they come out and then they are stronger and they can do more damage yeah and you are like great we paid for that okay so i think just to keep them busy you know even if they educate them i have heard of people you know the education i do not think it really hurt anybody i would say incorporate that with some education of some sort you know i mean i do not want to go out in the sun and work for five hours or whatnot plus they are doing something in return for free housing do you know what i mean it is kind of a give and take there 

Recording: (2414/ 9621) 
but i think it should be an option i am really for women is rights and everything because i was single for so long and i just feel if a man could have a child it would be different but since women are the only ones that can then it ultimately should be our choice i really do and i think we should have every option available especially when you are young no girl should have to go through pregnancy and everything even if it is a mistake or whatever i just you know it ruins their lives when they do not have the option 

Recording: (2415/ 9621) 
yeah i will yeah i will explain that to him 

Recording: (2416/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2417/ 9621) 
i 

Recording: (2418/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (2419/ 9621) 
right yeah 

Recording: (2420/ 9621) 
right i mean powell is booming and i think personally i could not have put him in daycare when he was an infant and i think i would have quit if a family would not have been available but since family was available and i think he is very social i think he was ready for the interaction with the other kids and three days a week is not right 

Recording: (2421/ 9621) 
that is it bingo 

Recording: (2422/ 9621) 
yeah i took 104 during winter quarter 

Recording: (2423/ 9621) 
so it is like you have these two different camps the camp that gets enthusiastic and that is where i was and then there is the other camp and i am sure they have their own hierarchy their whole structure and they do things their way 

Recording: (2424/ 9621) 
well i will make an analogy with your women who is more important who is saying that not being a priest is not important being your individual we are all called to be important a priest is just an occupation a part of that society out there the president of the united states is not any better off than you are he should not be 

Recording: (2425/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (2426/ 9621) 
yeah real bad and it was you know mainly no one talked about it 

Recording: (2427/ 9621) 
i would 

Recording: (2428/ 9621) 
that is right 

Recording: (2429/ 9621) 
whoa dude look there is a tornado over there and right at that time a big old pine tree got pushed across you know it is already been broken but it just got nonchalantly pushed across the freeway and he goes that is not a tornado that is fog man it is too far away i said what 

Recording: (2430/ 9621) 
i was born in los angeles california in the mid50s and when i was less than one year old my family moved to columbus the first place we lived in columbus was in whitehall near the corner of hamilton and then shortly after that we moved out to reynoldsburg and i lived there until my sophomore year in high school and during my sophomore year in high school we moved to worthington and i graduated from high school i went to oberlin college and then i graduated from there in 1976 and moved back to columbus and did a variety of jobs in columbus then i went to ohio state university from 1983 to 91 and got a master is degree in geology so i am an alumnus and after that i had another variety of jobs but i have lived and well during that time i guess i lived in the university area for a number of years i lived on 16th avenue near the fairgrounds and let us see had a number of different jobs currently i at hilliard and i live in worthington in the south part of worthington i am renting a room from my mom and i am yes and i sort of took a step backwards and right now i am saving up money and trying to buy a house somewhere and it is i am sort of kicking myself wishing i would have done about 20 or 30 years ago because it would have been a lot cheaper right right it was not a top priority for me then yeah 

Recording: (2431/ 9621) 
huh 

Recording: (2432/ 9621) 
10 years no question about it that is it you are in jail for 10 years 18 years old if you have got anything on 10 years that is it and you look at some of these other people like these sports people 

Recording: (2433/ 9621) 
we are getting more fun stuff all the time but predominantly it is still got way too much cow town personality 

Recording: (2434/ 9621) 
so when he did that though i mean there is medication out there that can help people like i said i do not want to see people with brain injury with mental illness or with any kind of disability use that as an excuse 

Recording: (2435/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (2436/ 9621) 
like pigeons okay 

Recording: (2437/ 9621) 
i am sorry 

Recording: (2438/ 9621) 
you know so you can use all those opportunities to show your kid what not to do 

Recording: (2439/ 9621) 
i mean you do not know anything behind it or what is going into it why would you do something like that 

Recording: (2440/ 9621) 
she always says mom it was fine she said i got to do a whole lot of things you will not let them do now in exchange for that now that i know better she is always very generous about it and says she had more time alone with me i split with her dad when she was about a year and a half and until she was six it was just she and i 

Recording: (2441/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2442/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2443/ 9621) 
that is nice 

Recording: (2444/ 9621) 
north 

Recording: (2445/ 9621) 
she is a librarian at an elementary school one block from our house 

Recording: (2446/ 9621) 
you have heard of the anjo beachhead we will go up there and get around behind them 

Recording: (2447/ 9621) 
there is not a big established gallery system and everything so a lot of things were just available you know you just could walk in and show anywhere and so i met a lot of people doing that i mean i am mainly friends with the same people i met then artists my age i do not belong to any formal groups in columbus but it is a real strong network of people everybody knows everybody 

Recording: (2448/ 9621) 
and research and stuff like that to do a lot of things that were done years ago 

Recording: (2449/ 9621) 
cooper i just do not see him ever hugging the guys or saying great job or anything 

Recording: (2450/ 9621) 
now i go 

Recording: (2451/ 9621) 
think about things i mean it is pretty easy to do 

Recording: (2452/ 9621) 
well i agree that we should help them maybe through some sort of government program but i think what really hurts them the most is the people that actually give them the money on high street because it really does not motivate them to get out of the gutter i mean if they can make a living off of begging change off of college students they are probably going to stay with that because it is a really easy life 

Recording: (2453/ 9621) 
about four or five years that is not that bad how old oh that is very young yeah you do not want another one yet you want at least diapers out of the way before you go to the next one 

Recording: (2454/ 9621) 
i think the point is they are on drugs you know and i do not yeah i am not i do not consider myself racist at all it is unfortunate that that is what is happening but it is just one of those things that you hate to say yeah i am for it because you sound like it is like everything is specific and permanent yeah i kind of have a problem with that because they might change their mind but then again they can always adopt adopt you know and i kind of look at it that way there is enough kids out there that need love and 

Recording: (2455/ 9621) 
gosh you know that is one of the things that i have really you know when i read the paper i think wow what can you do it has to start there first you know and i think if and this might be because i am a woman but i think if women started running things it would be a lot different than when men run things because men tend to think you know like the government and that kind of thing those kind of funds that are available for different organizations they are all geared toward things that essentially help them as a whole or help well yeah but i mean not so much that it is always been the women is responsibility to be responsible for the kids or to care about their wellbeing and a peaceful environment and all that kind of thing men are more let us go get it we need more money 

Recording: (2456/ 9621) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (2457/ 9621) 
i am sure i am sure it is you know it is just the circles i move in 

Recording: (2458/ 9621) 
mmhmm oh yeah you know well you can see it here i mean you see some 19 year old or 18 year old guy or girl or whatever you know and see the difference in the maturity you know of another couple of three different people and everything i do not know whether me coming from like a rural area you know i asked and everything i think it maybe has something to do with that even to today you know you are more familyoriented your friends are basically you know you count them on your hands what you still can but but you socialize a lot more if you are in the city with more people and everything where if you come from like a smaller town you tend to socialize with a certain people you know group or whatever 

Recording: (2459/ 9621) 
i got thrown out of high school 

Recording: (2460/ 9621) 
i mean he is kind of in big trouble they are wanting to pull the charter on him and everything but he is going to try and keep the school open which is going to be ridiculous 

Recording: (2461/ 9621) 
yeah four girls 

Recording: (2462/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2463/ 9621) 
i love it 

Recording: (2464/ 9621) 
it ai not my job i am doing her work she ai not 

Recording: (2465/ 9621) 
i do not agree with that at all i think if your parents are unhappy together only thing that is going to happen is it is going to trickle down and you are going to have to listen to them being miserable and i think it is much more positive to have two families that are happy than one family that is miserable and they fight and then you feel like it is your you know people say it is my fault because this happened and i think for me it was easier that they split up when i was younger than i can not imagine being a teenager and having my parents split up i think that that would be probably very difficult so i do not know that is a totally different perspective just to look at it from that point of view just because i was a lot younger 

Recording: (2466/ 9621) 
sniff 

Recording: (2467/ 9621) 
like while she was studying or something i think we played this homer simpson song she got so mad it was so worth it 

Recording: (2468/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2469/ 9621) 
it might it might i was gonna say earlier and i forgot to mention it is that one of the best campaigns i have seen in recent years utilizing collegeage students has been clinton is campaign both times he knew he needed to get a base to increase his chances of winning the election and did especially in the first campaign and i believe that was 92 did a really super job of organizing college students because that is when you are at your most when you believe in things and you are at your most idealistic and you would think that kids would automatically be interested in something and he was able to tap into that in addition to that and as an undercurrent it was not overt in the clinton campaign but i know when i talk to people and you have to be careful where you do this because abortion is a very divisive issue in this country and i think it does mobilize people but it also divides them definitively almost like in vietnam almost like that war divided people but i would tell many many women that they had to vote for clinton because it was the difference between protecting roe versus wade and not and in protecting choice and i am starting to see that now even in the gore campaign i have seen a couple of editorials in the paper about the next president will again have an opportunity to appoint two to three supreme court justices and if you want to protect that right you have got to vote with the candidate who is going to put the best justices on the supreme court and i got a lot of people to vote for clinton that way both in 92 and again in 96 and i think that is going to happen again because the candidates and i am telling you my politics here very clearly and early but the candidates have pretty well spoken on that issue already i know which one will protect the right for choice and i think we need to protect that so yes i think it will but i do not think it is an issue that if you did overtly and said you know support candidate a over candidate b because they will protect abortion rights that is going to divide the country and not keep us together 

Recording: (2470/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (2471/ 9621) 
but it is really 

Recording: (2472/ 9621) 
i am not real big on the denominations because i think that sort of goes against what the original intent of christianity was i mean it was designed to be a unifying religion and the denominations are just i do not like them 

Recording: (2473/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (2474/ 9621) 
yeah right i taught well i was a speech therapist probably five or six years and then ever since that i have been in 

Recording: (2475/ 9621) 
i would say probably the black man 

Recording: (2476/ 9621) 
it is like where i work at the only way i can get a raise is by being like the kids used to say a tattletale squealer whatever you want to call it 

Recording: (2477/ 9621) 
growing up my father had restaurants and a couple private clubs so i was always interested in the food industry but more so with planning of the parties and deciding what the clients needs are i really like working in that aspect with nice chefs and really creative food it is nice because basically every job is usually different i am doing a function tonight for 300 people for the higher republican party and you know there is just needs for each thing that i do which makes it interesting 

Recording: (2478/ 9621) 
if you have to come back to this weather i would do i would is it really 

Recording: (2479/ 9621) 
but 

Recording: (2480/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (2481/ 9621) 
now we run an online system where people connect to our system and build databases or access the databases everything osu has in their library collection is in our system their records came from us yeah and we do that for tens of thousands of libraries 

Recording: (2482/ 9621) 
about it 

Recording: (2483/ 9621) 
kind of yeah actually with this case i do know what happened to the father he ended up moving to colorado 

Recording: (2484/ 9621) 
being here at the university 

Recording: (2485/ 9621) 
mmm 

Recording: (2486/ 9621) 
yeah you spend the money to live there and then you go somewhere else i really do not understand that some people do it 

Recording: (2487/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2488/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2489/ 9621) 
but you do not really have to work as hard there apparently 

Recording: (2490/ 9621) 
i did get better grades last nine weeks did not i well is not that amazing you were taking your pills then some connection here so you kind of just have to sit them down and say well let us just go through some of the things that give you trouble and we will write them down and say oh well last nine weeks you did that without any problem at all this nine weeks you have not been able to focus on that maybe medicine does help you some maybe you are just not giving it credit 

Recording: (2491/ 9621) 
mmhmm she went to school here till 91 actually so she was see about the fourth grade fifth grade 

Recording: (2492/ 9621) 
to say you know what i am sick of this i am going to shoot those people 

Recording: (2493/ 9621) 
as far as what he did i am sure that he probably did go to meetings but as far as being a leader or something like that i am sure he was not 

Recording: (2494/ 9621) 
and i think they have a lot to do you know the parks and things like that so i will just hold it but i like it because it has art and culture and it does not feel like a big city 

Recording: (2495/ 9621) 
most of them are still sadly just sitting there and following my directions but they are getting better 

Recording: (2496/ 9621) 
i do not think you do that here 

Recording: (2497/ 9621) 
when 

Recording: (2498/ 9621) 
really you know i agree i mean none of the above you go and i think a lot more people would certainly go out they would vote for none of the above and then we can have some more candidates 

Recording: (2499/ 9621) 
yeah i know it is good one of us feels that way 

Recording: (2500/ 9621) 
and 

Recording: (2501/ 9621) 
that was grade school 

Recording: (2502/ 9621) 
some really wacky 

Recording: (2503/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2504/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2505/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2506/ 9621) 
obviously it is not something new that is been coming around i mean it is been around for a long time 

Recording: (2507/ 9621) 
there you go 

Recording: (2508/ 9621) 
yeah well what my opinion on our whole penal system is just you know well it goes along with kind of neglecting the kids in our schools right now and we are definitely neglecting criminals they need to have be educated and worked with i mean they need to obviously some place some point they have learned incorrect reasoning or whatever you call it and they need to they need to have psychological help period 

Recording: (2509/ 9621) 
but it did not bother me religions basically everybody when i was in there back in the 60s everybody was pretty much a christian you know christianity either catholic or something like that but nowadays you know you have the more outspokenness on muslims and islam and judaism and everything and there again i do not have a problem with that you know because you got to meet yourself you know you got to make your peace with your maker because you know if you believe in religion you are here temporarily for an eternity later on you know 

Recording: (2510/ 9621) 
who is been real helpful with being a support my parents are very supportive it was just sickening when i sat down there and the bidding started at $125000 and actually they offered us $12000 and my attorney looked at me and said are you fucking nuts i said this guy had his head split open and it was your negligence so you know we will take that as an insult 

Recording: (2511/ 9621) 
to communicate with our neighbors like years ago you knew everybody in town well the town i grew up in was summer station i do not know if you are that old teenyweeny town or not but it is not a very big town and everybody knew everybody 

Recording: (2512/ 9621) 
i wish i knew the answer but reality i just feel sorry for the people that not only feel that they have to do that but also for the people that are involved in it and the other those victims and everything and their parents and everything the only one i really had to i was really upset with was the columbine deal and that was because the one kid was making bombs and stuff like that in the basement and the parents knew nothing about it or if they did they did not even think anything about it and i do not think that behavior it is appropriate for a 16 17 year old kid 

Recording: (2513/ 9621) 
because he went through this hitting spell where he liked to hit people and i smacked his hands for that i try not to yell but it is hard not to yell i try to talk to him 

Recording: (2514/ 9621) 
oh yeah we are members of their 

Recording: (2515/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2516/ 9621) 
and he had been through a counseling experience before and he just played along with it then to get out of it i think 

Recording: (2517/ 9621) 
sure 

Recording: (2518/ 9621) 
nothing serious now 

Recording: (2519/ 9621) 
so i mean basically the entire winter i would either be doing stuff by myself or on the team wrestling with my friends so the whole reason i quit wrestling is because the coach wanted me to cut too much weight i was really starting to feel it physically 

Recording: (2520/ 9621) 
okay so our backbone is still there but ultimately as we get traffic measurements we will be able to downsize the number of pipes we have so streamlining our network 

Recording: (2521/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (2522/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2523/ 9621) 
whatever you want sure 

Recording: (2524/ 9621) 
i am sure 

Recording: (2525/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2526/ 9621) 
uh huh 

Recording: (2527/ 9621) 
and we stayed there for a while and then she met my stepdad when i was about six years old i think and then they moved up to clintonville when i was about eight now my dad lives up in clintonville too 

Recording: (2528/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2529/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2530/ 9621) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (2531/ 9621) 
i that is another thing that that where i am at odds with my parents or that they do not understand the fact that why would i go to college i paid for it myself i worked my way through school i was so proud of the fact that i was like only a quarter late than my actual schedule to graduate which is pretty amazing given the fact that i was paying for it as i went and i did not have any loans when i was done it was paid for and so of course tuition was $125 a quarter but i was only making you know 50 cents an hour at the beverly across the street on neal avenue so but anyhow you know they could never understand you know you never got a job with it you know why would you go to school and waste all that money it was the best money i ever spent 

Recording: (2532/ 9621) 
you know they are just trying to spread out a little bit and eventually it will be something a little more nationwide but they really just wanted to start off with something easy and they only take national merit scholars in there 

Recording: (2533/ 9621) 
turn the music up it is already blasting 

Recording: (2534/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2535/ 9621) 
and they fought a lot there was a lot of violence and then i love walt disney i mean all that stuff they have beautiful music but i swear i have not seen a walt disney movie that does not have violence in it 

Recording: (2536/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2537/ 9621) 
absolutely 

Recording: (2538/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2539/ 9621) 
hehe 

Recording: (2540/ 9621) 
work is gotta be easier than this 

Recording: (2541/ 9621) 
in the world 

Recording: (2542/ 9621) 
yeah exactly exactly 

Recording: (2543/ 9621) 
yeah and just a couple things i remember when i first started going to the unitarian church up here on well when i was in sunday school we drove there from reynoldsburg by going up i think reynoldsburgnew albany road up to morse road and then over on morse road to high street so it was on the back roads you know and that was before the mid60s when the freeway was built i70 was built through town and a lot of times you do not realize what kind of havoc that creates when a freeway is built through the middle of a town because you have to take out a lot of houses to do that and you can sort of realize that if you ever go around the area and go to one of the little side streets that dead ends because the freeways there and see the side street continue on the other side and you think about there must have been 20 or 30 houses that they had to take out here 

Recording: (2544/ 9621) 
but they lived in a beautiful home i mean kids like that i could see if they are poor in harlem or whatever but these kids lived in a nice neighborhood in a beautiful home in colorado i mean you know i just think they were removed from what their children their son was doing 

Recording: (2545/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (2546/ 9621) 
so it is not a there was a man named sun bear who was recruiting women you know and telling them they had to sweat naked 

Recording: (2547/ 9621) 
i mean i could practically graduate already i have all the credits but then you have those required classes that you have to take 

Recording: (2548/ 9621) 
i do not say that of all of the kids because i know that some of them were brought up right 

Recording: (2549/ 9621) 
my older sister was a different case she was a little badder but as long as you have a good parent i think that is really all that matters because my mom was my mother and father she did very well 

Recording: (2550/ 9621) 
it is medicare type 

Recording: (2551/ 9621) 
oh wow how would you hook up with that or did it just happen 

Recording: (2552/ 9621) 
yes private homes and actually where i work there is not a facility 

Recording: (2553/ 9621) 
go out 

Recording: (2554/ 9621) 
that is the only way i can get a raise over there where i work at 

Recording: (2555/ 9621) 
he was living with this one family for a while and they were nudists and taking him to nudist camps and stuff like this would not you think they would they never had any contact with this they just let him move in can you imagine letting your 14yearold friend just move in and not find out why or anything 

Recording: (2556/ 9621) 
i mean colin powell was pretty close if he would have ran 

Recording: (2557/ 9621) 
her house in india is like this mansion and they have servants there i mean it is really impressive just the houses are just worth more so you can not get as much house here but yeah everybody is doing well 

Recording: (2558/ 9621) 
아이고 아이고 

Recording: (2559/ 9621) 
we come to as many games as we can we both golf and we like hiking swimming every year we used to go on a trip this year we went to new mexico we were thinking about moving out there 

Recording: (2560/ 9621) 
we develop a lot of software and projects and i consult on the database side 

Recording: (2561/ 9621) 
it is been good for my son 

Recording: (2562/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2563/ 9621) 
and you told me not to lose that so i am trying to stick to that sorry 

Recording: (2564/ 9621) 
yeah and the problem is seeing things in other people i mean actually seeing spirits in other people in terms of someone said the eyes are the mirror to the soul that is very true i can see in certain people is eyes when i was in the hospital the confusion the unsure feelings you know the i do not know just something i could see there that i can not explain and i still can not explain it i just know what i see and then i go and try and tell the psychologist or psychiatrist well they want to put me on some kind of antihallucinogenic medication and i said well listen man you know i am not hallucinating 

Recording: (2565/ 9621) 
yeah it was not there we go 

Recording: (2566/ 9621) 
right right 

Recording: (2567/ 9621) 
by the eighth grade they are sixth and seventh graders pretty much know everything and you are the stupid one but by the time they get to eighth grade they are going oh you are the best teacher i can not believe i said that to you 

Recording: (2568/ 9621) 
well i think in my opinion i think mainly it is the absence of basically parenting you know my mom was there she was a housewife you know and so she went to work after i think when i was a junior in high school you know and my brother all my brothers and sisters are already graduated you know 

Recording: (2569/ 9621) 
she went to my school she just barely works at all apparently 

Recording: (2570/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (2571/ 9621) 
no i really just kind of lay on the floor and watch everybody else go around 

Recording: (2572/ 9621) 
you know you have to be a good example i mean if you if you are just that for your kids then that is all they need you know you might not always do the right things or say the right things but if you are taking care of yourself and you stay positive and do the right things and i think that is the best you can do for them 

Recording: (2573/ 9621) 
so he gives them a drug called welbutrin which is a you know like an antidepressant type thing that they said works for adhd but it really helped him you know concentrate to be able to study 

Recording: (2574/ 9621) 
i am during different points of the day i do not know 

Recording: (2575/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (2576/ 9621) 
but it made a lot of people more rare 

Recording: (2577/ 9621) 
well i think they need to do away with a lot of the foster homes you know a lot of the you know there is people with good intentions but i just think that it just needs to be restructured a totally different way and you know maybe pull these kids into more of a group setting or something and give them more you know counseling professional you know counseling is this you know i did not have good experiences with foster homes and and i know of a lot of kids you know that are saying that i think the parents have too many rights you know in the courts and there is just a lot going on you know that it is not going to get better it is going to get worse you know with the way families are torn apart now and you know mothers have to work and you just can not you know stay home and be that you know perfect mom you know so there is just a lot going on that needs to be restructured so 

Recording: (2578/ 9621) 
peace 

Recording: (2579/ 9621) 
i mean obviously if someone is like 30 and they are gay i do not see them as being too wanting to change their entire life basically at that point in time 

Recording: (2580/ 9621) 
if you were not here well he was the first capital punishment case in ohio in 20 or 25 years or something like that and he would killed somebody and he was on death row and he wanted to be executed and i thought that is a cop out if there ever was one just to give him a lethal injection and let him go he should have rotted in prison for it no that is not a punishment he was off his rocker there is not anybody who murders who is not insane 

Recording: (2581/ 9621) 
and they went through their own training and everything we did not interface with each other or nothing like that i mean you might see one walking or marching somewhere but as far as fraternizing you were not allowed to 

Recording: (2582/ 9621) 
it is so corrupt they have two choices to stay in it and try or to succumb to all the things and 90 of them as you can see what happens in washington have succumbed i do not hear any of them raising hell about what really matters in this country 

Recording: (2583/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (2584/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (2585/ 9621) 
i do not really know honestly i mean it is definitely careless nature and definitely something has to be done to him 

Recording: (2586/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (2587/ 9621) 
that is a little hard to accept you know it is hard to know what he is going through how much of it is normal teenage rebellion and how much of it is just 

Recording: (2588/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (2589/ 9621) 
well yeah when he was i do not remember how many months it went on for like two months where he just cried it might have been colic or whatever but he just cried and yeah 

Recording: (2590/ 9621) 
have 

Recording: (2591/ 9621) 
and because of that the athletic director that was here at the time he quit because he did not want to fire them and they overruled him 

Recording: (2592/ 9621) 
and so i get a lot of you know what from my sisters 

Recording: (2593/ 9621) 
oh well 

Recording: (2594/ 9621) 
yeah i was in the sales department through telephone marketing it was actual sales that i was doing i was there for 15 years 

Recording: (2595/ 9621) 
it is like a double scene like it is weird 

Recording: (2596/ 9621) 
and then remember back on it 

Recording: (2597/ 9621) 
like ever but i do not know it is real weird 

Recording: (2598/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (2599/ 9621) 
all right 

Recording: (2600/ 9621) 
well i think that my opinion is that if you ai not going to school and you are not going you are not working and everything you should be doing something besides causing problems you know and a lot of kids that is all they really want to do nowadays is just cause aggravation to people 

Recording: (2601/ 9621) 
to the hub which of course eliminated downtime but with that we were not in a position to monitor traffic 

Recording: (2602/ 9621) 
byebye 

Recording: (2603/ 9621) 
and i think of course we would all hope that abortion would not be that nobody would have an abortion that would be the perfect world because nobody would ever be in a situation where they would need one but i also think yeah there should not be there should not spend six weeks on abortion or six weeks on what to do if you are pregnant but i think the subject has to be mentioned just in passing in health class maybe and then it should be known that you can go to your counselor 

Recording: (2604/ 9621) 
and i sit there and go you know i tell people i go to the va clinic and everything they got a homeless thing over there and i say you know this guy brenda i know you know he is a vietnam vet you guys need to get out there and help him you know i mean you are in more of a situation than i am to be able to go out and sit there but he wants me to take him like mary haven or something like that and he is been there before and all he does is stay till he sobers up and goes back out 

Recording: (2605/ 9621) 
of the medical school class which is 220 

Recording: (2606/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (2607/ 9621) 
ninja turtle well the kids went into that just so intensively and they were supposed to be real good guys but i mean the visual was pretty miserable in my opinion they wore these masks and hoods and 

Recording: (2608/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2609/ 9621) 
kind you know we know but it is 

Recording: (2610/ 9621) 
that would be great i would do it definitely 

Recording: (2611/ 9621) 
if you got a car it is easy to get there but if you are riding a bus it sometimes takes a couple hours 

Recording: (2612/ 9621) 
in some ways i like it in some ways it is not my favorite place but it seems like it is a relatively safe place to live although that is coming from me i have been robbed at gunpoint or knife point about four times i think in columbus yeah maybe five i drove a taxi cab for a couple summers and i was robbed i think twice driving the cab and part of it was just being stupid but it was down around the mount vernon area and i got very little money but i was not hurt 

Recording: (2613/ 9621) 
on tv and in the movies 

Recording: (2614/ 9621) 
i love columbus actually when i left i was fed up with columbus but like anything after being away for a while and not really being i mean i have friends there and everything but i miss my friends and i miss really sort of knowing everything in a city because london is never gonna be like that for me and it is just a totally different experience i did miss columbus and i am kind of glad to be back although now i miss london 

Recording: (2615/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2616/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2617/ 9621) 
they tried sampling well my brother rich was one of the families they sampled 

Recording: (2618/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (2619/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2620/ 9621) 
instead they pick up on oh soandso was arrested for drug dealing today he you know soandso age and they sort of give a background on him and that is what everyone bases their view on it seems to be is that everyone turns to the media to see what is going on when the media is only showing one side of the story i mean there is definitely much more out there that is going on than they are telling you so i really do not see a big problem with the way america is going or whatever the youth and like i said i would not say it is any worse than any past generations i mean other than like i mean obviously guns and things like that are being around but simply the reason being was because in past generations they were not around for it 

Recording: (2621/ 9621) 
yeah we did not really get the videotape they gave us was half infomercials and then things like how to clean the umbilical cord i mean stuff like that but as far as actual parenting things went there was really nothing 

Recording: (2622/ 9621) 
yeah it actually is his dad is mother babysits 

Recording: (2623/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (2624/ 9621) 
but the professors seem more centered to me they are like you have to balance it which i am sure is the truth you can not diminish all your bottom line for making your workers feel good but there is still something to it i think 

Recording: (2625/ 9621) 
again it gets back to the 10 tithing and i think there is something else in the bible where the lady gives only a small portion compared to a large portion but in relation to what her income was that meant a lot more and that we need to get more involved in that we need to promote more of that if we are going to package things and materialize we need to think more of that but i think really take home a night what would you be doing if you are a third world country did not have a choice 

Recording: (2626/ 9621) 
i said this will never work i am not interested take it back and he said no no no just work with us just work with us we will take care of this so i end up selling to him for $144 but it was just funny because i thought they are never going to get to where i have to be and we are not even going to play this game back and forth 

Recording: (2627/ 9621) 
dwin credu bod hynnyn ddiddorol 

Recording: (2628/ 9621) 
uh i mean obviously it is something that happens every day and things like that uh like said by no means my saying a go president clinton or anything like that but uh and i can not say it hold it against him for doing something like that i mean it is nothing that threaten the nation or whatever 

Recording: (2629/ 9621) 
aww 

Recording: (2630/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (2631/ 9621) 
i think that 

Recording: (2632/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (2633/ 9621) 
like they were expensive copy and paste collars in the home and they are just like oh well they will learn it there or whatever and the kids their basic where they learn things is their peers they do not get everything instilled at home that is pretty much what you know i seen talking to my husband and you know and there is so many broken homes and single moms and trying to do it all and the kids are the ones that are suffering and having to grow up before they are ready 

Recording: (2634/ 9621) 
i think there might be but i think most of them are a dying breed they are the older citizens many in my generation it is probably because i am the early baby boom i am the first of the baby boom and that is when the women is movement started and many men there still have not always accepted that so there might be a problem there but for the generations even the later baby boom generations behind me when i talk to them i talk to high school students or even young college students there is a whole world of difference between their attitudes and a lot of things and women is minority issues it is just secondhand to them it is not like it was for us which was a sea change for them it is normal so and more of those people are in the voting population if they would vote you know you would have to find a candidate who would know how to do what clinton did in 92 and get out that college vote 

Recording: (2635/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (2636/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2637/ 9621) 
they just had a baby a couple days ago yeah they had a little boy and i got a little sister she is 22 and she lives with her boyfriend 

Recording: (2638/ 9621) 
not as much as i used to be when i was younger used to be diehard but not anymore yeah by their standards but they still were 66 you know they probably could have won maybe a couple more games but that is about it you know really 

Recording: (2639/ 9621) 
it was cool so i like pretty much all kinds of music i dig sometimes to find the kind of music i really do not like that much and i like some country music i guess my favorites are classical and rock rock and roll especially i like some of the stuff that is coming out now i like oldies from the 70s and 60s and i guess what is hard for me to listen to is i guess i do not know it used to be wnci where they part of the reason was they just played the same songs over and over again yeah 

Recording: (2640/ 9621) 
oh my gosh they do not have any of these student matinee specials where you can go in for like a buck fifty huh 

Recording: (2641/ 9621) 
right right 

Recording: (2642/ 9621) 
excuse me but you know what i mean 

Recording: (2643/ 9621) 
to do that 

Recording: (2644/ 9621) 
whoops 

Recording: (2645/ 9621) 
i should not be having to clean quite as much as i do now i would say by 10 they should be able to help me prepare a meal or be able to pretty much do most of it by themselves i know i did it 10 and to be able to do their laundry maybe definitely help out a lot around the house 

Recording: (2646/ 9621) 
center of all things evil in the world 

Recording: (2647/ 9621) 
and my oldest sister started a school out there

Recording: (2651/ 9621) 
especially the guys yeah 

Recording: (2652/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (2653/ 9621) 
like i know like i was a fouryear member of student council and like did that went that route in high school and i know we always tried to involve other people but like they would look at us and be like that is so lame i would never do it 

Recording: (2654/ 9621) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (2655/ 9621) 
i said man why are they pulled over like that there must be something going on he goes oh we ai not going to worry about it right now i am going to get back up there 3 oclock in the afternoon and i look over and there is this big old white swirling cloud comes down it is about two miles west of us i am coming just out of my screws here i am just going

i was thinking of grandchildren 

Recording: (2657/ 9621) 
right well and i am right now i am 45 years old so i have lived in or around columbus for most of 44 years excluding times when i was away at school 

Recording: (2658/ 9621)

Recording: (2659/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (2660/ 9621) 
and as a way i put it it is kind of new agey and i do not like new agey stuff but you know it is the best example is moths from the dark when you flip on a light the moths will go right to it a child like that a young man like that is very impressionable very young still and these bad spirits will be flocked right to him 

Recording: (2661/ 9621) 
well i have not read enough to know i saw a preliminary saying that they were going to protest but i am not informed enough to give an opinion on that 

Recording: (2662/ 9621) 
yeah okay see the way i look at heaven myself is that i have a chance to meet all my acquaintances i had over the past 

Recording: (2663/ 9621) 
you know how to modify like i give in services all the time at my school for the regular ed teachers and i show them they go well that is going to make more work for me and i say how is telling the student to do every other problem instead of all 40 of them going to make 

Recording: (2664/ 9621) 
i am just kidding 

Recording: (2665/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (2666/ 9621) 
do you know what i mean 

Recording: (2667/ 9621) 
yeah one of my friend is cousins went to that fraternity i do not remember what the cause was of his death but i mean like i said i mean it definitely is a dangerous drug to be using and i mean not to say that they should legalize it or anything i mean obviously that is pretty extreme to do but like i said i mean it is something more where people should know the risks of it and know what goes into it i mean it is sort of like if you saw something laying on the street and you decided to eat it or whatever 

Recording: (2668/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (2669/ 9621) 
well my family is so funny because my parents are so you would never put them together now back then you know my well you saw my mom no you did not see her she is cute she is got a little haircut she is all like

Recording: (2673/ 9621) 
you know yeah 

Recording: (2674/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2675/ 9621)

Recording: (2676/ 9621) 
ha ha ha ha ha ha 

Recording: (2677/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (2678/ 9621) 
and it is like a car has a computer but it does not know if it is monday or 2050 it has no idea it means nothing it is not date sensitive you know 

Recording: (2679/ 9621) 
no the only germans i ever saw were pows 

Recording: (2680/ 9621) 
and partying sound pretty good so 

Recording: (2681/ 9621) 
i like it better than a magazine 

Recording: (2682/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2683/ 9621) 
it was for me and a couple other people that was it 

Recording: (2684/ 9621) 
but 

Recording: (2685/ 9621) 
well among the people i know i think it is a pretty tolerant city i know a lot of people who live down in old town you know in a very diverse environment and you know i just do not personally know any racists i do not think 

Recording: (2686/ 9621) 
mmhmm yeah so was there more of like actual dating would you say no no there was more just getting you know going out you know what do you do on saturday night nothing you want to go out yeah all right we will just go out you know and maybe get a kiss or something you know or go out and bid your cop is bill you know 

Recording: (2687/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (2688/ 9621) 
yeah or more you know i do not even know because it is just such a huge problem and it is gotten so out of hand it is going to be everybody all together that has to work it is going to be the teachers and the government and everybody but they all have to have one common thing and it cracks me up because we are so concerned about elion this poor little kid everybody knows who he is but you know you look at our own kids we do not even care about our own kids as much as we care i mean here is this little kid everybody knows who he is but you know you look at our own kids we do not even care about our own kids as much as we care i mean here is this little kid who still has a living parent and i do not understand that at all i mean that is just so i think the government gets involved in totally you know way out of line and 

Recording: (2689/ 9621) 
cry 

Recording: (2690/ 9621) 
i like this stuff as opposed to sitting around and playing computer games first of all because it is more interesting it is a lot more practical it is a little more problem solving less running around and shooting things it is like problem solving type little puzzles it is not as much sit in front of a tv and be entertained it is you create your own entertainment 

Recording: (2691/ 9621) 
hide in your basement again and i mean you can 

Recording: (2692/ 9621) 
no i do not see that kind of racism at all 

Recording: (2693/ 9621) 
it is interesting too because when she had her other child she was at otterbein then she made arrangements that she might have to be in the hospital taking a final with one of her teachers that baby was born in march i think she got the finals right in it is just too much stress for me to even think about 

Recording: (2694/ 9621) 
even though i knew better at the point when i was faced with that at 17 or whatever i wanted to be loved so bad that it was something that i you know what i mean and i knew better but you just you know and it is like well i was not that strong granted but i was probably the normal teen and i think most of the people i knew at that age were lost at much younger than 17 you know okay 11 12 it is like who we would look alike forget it but yeah so i think i think birth control would be good 

Recording: (2695/ 9621) 
i do not have a plane ticket yet i have a url pass though 

Recording: (2696/ 9621) 
mmhmm he did some assistant coach work at the osu for osu he really liked that 

Recording: (2697/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2698/ 9621) 
because apparently they get really fascinated by the fact that the lights are moving around right in front of them so i would do it right in front of their face and they would be like dude thanks 

Recording: (2699/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2700/ 9621) 
mmm 

Recording: (2701/ 9621) 
i was married but i did not have any kids once you have kids you are not going to be able to do that kind of a schedule but yeah so i did not take off any time and then when i got my master is i ran into an old friend of mine who teaches in worthington and he said oh i am the special ed director up there now we need a resource room teacher why do not you come up and interview for this position or that position when i went up and interviewed for that position got another position but anyway it all worked out 

Recording: (2702/ 9621) 
yeah yeah just sit on it she is not allowed on the couch but we had caught her last winter on the couch you know you come home and it is warm and hey there is a doggy bone up here hmm 

Recording: (2703/ 9621) 
even they do not get facts right a lot of the time 

Recording: (2704/ 9621) 
and i could not be a part of a veterinary practice that did that 

Recording: (2705/ 9621) 
um there were one or two 

Recording: (2706/ 9621) 
oh sure yeah 

Recording: (2707/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (2708/ 9621) 
well that is what i am saying 

Recording: (2709/ 9621) 
so it is really weird because uh 

Recording: (2710/ 9621) 
right right and it seems to me kind of a questionable thing to tell a teacher i am supposed to get an a what is wrong with you what is wrong with you 

Recording: (2711/ 9621) 
你呀 

Recording: (2712/ 9621) 
hmm 

Recording: (2713/ 9621) 
and of course that never happened 

Recording: (2714/ 9621) 
so it worked out well 

Recording: (2715/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2716/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2717/ 9621) 
and as more and more people are getting older and older there will be more need for it there is gonna be a lot of things there is gonna be more need for as people get older 

Recording: (2718/ 9621) 
no i feel funny that i am i mean i wish i was married if i was married it would be so much simpler in life but you know it just did not work out you know i was with his father for like nine years since i was 16 and he just did not grow up once we had him he did not change like i changed and so 

Recording: (2719/ 9621) 
i do not want either of these people 

Recording: (2720/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (2721/ 9621) 
yeah he is a real nice guy 

Recording: (2722/ 9621) 
yeah you should be well aware because the school has a big impact on the children and sometimes not all that positive right now so you know but you can tell how your child is doing of course 

Recording: (2723/ 9621) 
17 and 19 

Recording: (2724/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2725/ 9621)

Recording: (2729/ 9621) 
heh heh heh 

Recording: (2730/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (2731/ 9621) 
but at the same time i do not dislike him or anything for it it is their choice the fact of the matter is it does not have any effect or anything on my life 

Recording: (2732/ 9621) 
i picked up one kid he he had been in he was only about 15 he was adopted and he ran away 

Recording: (2733/ 9621) 
no i mean like said i think a little kids are going to be a little kids if that stuff was not to be there still gonna act the same way there is no going to be walk around with toy guns things like that playing war whatever 

Recording: (2734/ 9621) 
i mean that is a lot of money for having a good time you know 

Recording: (2735/ 9621) 
i am telling you some people go nuts with the name i worked at a children is hospital when i was in college at the ear nose and throat outpatient clinic a couple summers and i am telling you i had to put some names on the books like you would not believe ima darling that was her name ima darling and there was a little boy named ephraim zimbalist jr cocacola franklin i am supposed to fit that in a space like that no i am telling you 

Recording: (2736/ 9621) 
my name is 

Recording: (2737/ 9621)

Recording: (2738/ 9621)

Recording: (2746/ 9621) 
when i started dating at almost 17 so no i think you learn a lot from your family and the way their relationships are i personally do not think a school can do it 

Recording: (2747/ 9621) 
you know i mean i liked earl bruce and i waited on him a couple of times at a restaurant i worked at he was the nicest man and when they did that i do not know if you know about that when they fired him the day before the michigan game for having a nine to three season three years in a row they fired him the day before that game

Recording: (2760/ 9621) 
i went to it is the new high school there 

Recording: (2761/ 9621) 
i have gone to one but i had a back problem that is how i dealt with it and it worked 

Recording: (2762/ 9621) 
i do not i mean there definitely is that image of dallas and dynasty i think it is worse i think for the image of the tourists like basically they think anyone who can afford to be over there must be absolutely loaded and that was sort of another thing when i went to school there is i had a scholarship that is how i went there i worked the whole time i was in high school and college and all this kind of thing but it was just like people just thought oh you are american you are here therefore you must have lots of extra money to throw around they just sort of do not grasp the fact that you can have made sacrifices to be there but i do think also in films i remember actually being in bristol in that film california with brad pitt and julie lewis and they are in the trailer and everything else and their accent and i remember a bunch of people were sitting in this sort of lounge room watching this and they said like oh you know something like is that what they talk like or is that what it is like in the south and i thought oh my gosh you know what an image to have of like the south and you know i was just kind of shocked at this but i think that they are you know with people who are going to university there and things like that there is not necessarily that opinion maybe you know in a certain sector like when all you have heard is the consumption and everything else there might be more of that idea but i think most people like me or whatever well i should not say like but people who have more education not even without having to really think about it but there is not just that blatant view i think that it is the consumption thing i think a lot more realize now that i think americans have this reputation which is totally true for spending spending spending obviously when you give that a closer look so many i mean i think i just saw something else in the news that said you know across the board we do not even break even we are like negative one or something 

Recording: (2763/ 9621) 
oh you are kidding 

Recording: (2764/ 9621) 
yes mucho es money 

Recording: (2765/ 9621) 
people drive by and look at my little house there in the middle of it all 

Recording: (2766/ 9621) 
but it is another thing that they are in their own in the house where the parents are every night and not going into the garage and finding things 

Recording: (2767/ 9621) 
i have a decoder card what it does is it decodes the dvd right away rather than sending it through the processor so it is a lot faster it does not depend on my processor time the movie does not skip or anything it just goes straight through so what do you do do you have meetings and then talk about computer stuff or are you able to go to trade shows no no nothing like that twice a month we have our technical modules which are we hook up these tiny little green screen computers the little old keyboards from like 1985 i sit there and tinker around on those 

Recording: (2768/ 9621) 
i live at 161 in cleveland area an apartment up there 

Recording: (2769/ 9621) 
i always hate it when people name their kids jamilia kenesha and i am like 

Recording: (2770/ 9621) 
and now they live in gay relationships 

Recording: (2771/ 9621) 
they went to private schools i certainly did not want them to go to public schools even when going to ohio state compared to miami university i see a difference in the standards of the students but i believe and i have seen it with my son going to ohio state that his morals that he is gained through his precollege years are staying with him and i am very grateful that there is a spiritual guidance i keep telling these guys my daughter and son that they would come to me for answers i do not know that is probably the other problem sometimes the siblings or the children do not have a parent to go to but again let me reiterate we do not have a smooth marriage they saw us have difficult times and they saw us our spouses crying together forgiving one another arguing with another just as much as you can have be in a human relation they saw that they saw the love for one another they saw overnight where i would start caring for my dad because my mother died instantly you know like short term an hour and now he had a stroke i did not know whether i saved their lives and had learned all that and i had to take care of him but then i saw my wife taking over some of my role at home so we swing him that is what i said a team player we knew what we had to do my son might come home and say well gee you know he might smart off my wife would say hey that is your dad give him respect 

Recording: (2772/ 9621) 
and decisions are happening to her without her making them and i think she needs to have as many facts as she can get her hands on 

Recording: (2773/ 9621) 
do whatever i want to some degree 

Recording: (2774/ 9621) 
but she does not believe it yeah yeah she is very pragmatic she could probably 

Recording: (2775/ 9621) 
and pretty much stuff like that and he would try to quote the bible and i would have a bible there with me and i would look it up and it would not be right at all 

Recording: (2776/ 9621) 
yeah exactly so i said well you know i went to padre island i said well i did not want to get you know it is in texas 

Recording: (2777/ 9621) 
actually he in the 50s he had a jazz club and it was real popular it had food and live music peggy lee sang there and some kind of name people i was not around but and also he had a private club that is it was similar to the bunny club it was the key club where people had to pay a membership and it was in a real nice area downtown here and he is also owned he is a he is a broker he sells liquor licenses and things so he is owned several kinds of bars but originally owned the open the top steakhouse which is real popular in bexley and then sold it like three years later so mainly clubs and businesses but two really good restaurants 

Recording: (2778/ 9621) 
she did my exwife did i would have preferred her to continue going to school but she had some problems with some students and stuff 

Recording: (2779/ 9621) 
and 

Recording: (2780/ 9621) 
well actually anybody can try there is a civil service exam you have to take and they place you on a list from that say if you have an 80 well everybody that takes it after you that gets an 81 is going to get hired before you do so you can take it again but if you score lower you have got to keep that lower score so sometimes people are kind of apprehensive about doing that but once you pass that and then they say the government goes ok we are ready to hire a thousand people throughout the united states well each region there is regions in the united states they may get like 30 for the great lakes region so they go down the list the first 30 and they call you know they write each one of them and say we are offering you a position do you want it or not and you know some of the people have said well i have been on the list for two years and i have a job and i do not want it it now those people have to go to oklahoma city to the academy and go through a screening program which is really hard at one time only 40 of the people were making it through that 

Recording: (2781/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2782/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2783/ 9621) 
and you need to have the violence and stuff like that i have never heard and you know i am just using pot right now 

Recording: (2784/ 9621) 
we went back to our room and we watched a movie my roommate that she was talking to played around on his computer 

Recording: (2785/ 9621) 
no i have never been to that one that one has a big reput 

Recording: (2786/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (2787/ 9621) 
one of those 

Recording: (2788/ 9621) 
see ya 

Recording: (2789/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2790/ 9621) 
we should be getting pretty near 

Recording: (2791/ 9621) 
i think 

Recording: (2792/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (2793/ 9621) 
but it takes away that big trip we have been and then his brother got married in hawaii so we went out there so we have just done the honeymoon at disney world the albuquerque a couple times in hawaii but we have plans to go to europe he wants to go to england and things like that and i want it we are looking into greece 

Recording: (2794/ 9621)

Recording: (2795/ 9621) 
girlfriend works for hell also known as ameritech 

Recording: (2796/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (2797/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2798/ 9621) 
buh 

Recording: (2799/ 9621) 
but that is how i see the only regular crop they had when they were out there my parents was kids 

Recording: (2800/ 9621) 
wow i did not realize that 

Recording: (2801/ 9621) 
especially if you are waiting to go into combat 

Recording: (2802/ 9621) 
i think that is too young to talk about birth control methods and everything but with aids and as rampant as it is now and there is so many more women that have it start off it was mostly men women have got to know at an early age about these different diseases and things 

Recording: (2803/ 9621) 
i remember a time when i was a brand new teacher i was maybe fifth or sixth year of teaching that is still pretty new i said john what is your last name he said guess i said i do not feel like guessing tell me your last name he said guess i said john i want to know your last name and he said guess i am like oh sorry thank you 

Recording: (2804/ 9621) 
that was part of the reason 

Recording: (2805/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2806/ 9621) 
but in the winters when you know i mean i do not exercise that much 

Recording: (2807/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2808/ 9621) 
it is a clinical study where we are seeing how treadmill training affects ambulation in people with spinal cord injury 

Recording: (2809/ 9621) 
i appreciate your opinions but were you asking have we seen a change in the politicians through our lifetime was that particularly your point 

Recording: (2810/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2811/ 9621) 
mmm 

Recording: (2812/ 9621) 
do you think there is a heaven 

Recording: (2813/ 9621) 
i think it is harder on him because he is demanding of my attention and i think that is a little harder because he was an only child for nearly five years so it is been an adjustment for him but he loves his baby brother it is really he nurtures him too so that is neat to watch 

Recording: (2814/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2815/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2816/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2817/ 9621) 
here in columbus yeah i have always lived in columbus 

Recording: (2818/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2819/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (2820/ 9621) 
i went to ou for about three months but i just got out of school you know how it is 

Recording: (2821/ 9621) 
i would just tell him that is just a feeling he is going through i have went through that where you look at a woman and she is attractive to you but that is just something that is going through your mind i think that is like the devil getting into you because i would never sleep with a woman i would never do it even though i might be really would have been real drunk and just you know i would just tell him that is something he is going through and that is wrong for him to do that he you know he is a man and that would tell him god did not put two men on this earth and if he would choose to do that that i would not hate him or disown him or anything like that 

Recording: (2822/ 9621) 
the opportunity to serve one another and that is the downfall of our society because we are thinking more of ourselves instead of others and i think as we become older you start thinking about how much your weaknesses are but really your weaknesses are the strength that you pull from your faith it is not the materialistic things that the university here professes to be the thing 

Recording: (2823/ 9621) 
i know and you know and the thing is you are going to have a great time with your kids and it is just it is it is it is almost like if it had to be like that for me to realize it and have it like this it is worth it 

Recording: (2824/ 9621) 
mmm 

Recording: (2825/ 9621) 
you had it 

Recording: (2826/ 9621) 
i do it so 

Recording: (2827/ 9621) 
he will basically tell you he do not have no father except for me 

Recording: (2828/ 9621) 
well i 

Recording: (2829/ 9621) 
as it turned out he expected us to play the solos we did not play the whole piece we only played one movement of it i thought it came out pretty well to have a recording of it for a while there i was worried that we did not get a recording of it and i was really upset 

Recording: (2830/ 9621) 
right you can not really ignore i have heard people say i refuse to read the dispatch well you gotta know what is going on locally i am sorry 

Recording: (2831/ 9621) 
and so that is a whole different that is real different from the way it used to be even though it looks the same 

Recording: (2832/ 9621) 
yeah up on bethel road 

Recording: (2833/ 9621) 
if you did not own let us say on a school levy you pay taxes i always because i rent and i always get very upset and very angry when people say well you do not have to pay school taxes yes i do because every time a school tax passes my rent goes up it is built into the rent at least it ought to be or i have a pretty dumb landlord and i have never lived any place where my rent did not go up after a school levy passed and usually in direct proportion and beyond of what the levy was so that would be the first thing i would say and then i would also say that you know because a number of reasons that people do not vote for school levies now is because they do not have kids in the schools but education is the foundation of a democracy and if you do not have an educated citizenry your democracy could go down the drain that was why thomas jefferson founded so many schools or the university of virginia and believed in education because he said without an educated citizenry you will not understand the issues but it is very difficult today to get to people i have talked to some almost collegeage students and they do not see the relationship you can talk logic to them all you want and it is not like the logic gets to them and you can talk history all you want and it does not mean anything to them and i do not know why i wish i did but i do not know why 

Recording: (2834/ 9621) 
i had considered that yes 

Recording: (2835/ 9621) 
mmhmm yeah i think basically that goes back to you know the parenting and everything you know there was something missing in the child is life you know that he was not getting perhaps attention those kids in particular i do not understand how they could be building bombs and in their basement mom and dad not know what was going on you know i mean it is just a tragedy i had a friend when i was a kid too that we were like i do not know 11 years old or something like that well an accidental shooting and then and another friend of mine from the same class you know he pulled a gun and shot him you know and did not know the damn thing was loaded and they were talking about another thing about that you know where some kid i guess that happened just here in town a couple about a week ago or something like that you know guy shot another guy but i mean those things are just senseless crimes really who is really to fault who is really who is guilty i do not know i would like to have not to say they ever would have but if one of the two that you columbine if they would have survived i would like to have seen today ever would have but if one of the two that you that columbine you know if they would have survived i would like to have seen what was going through their heads you know but that is something we will never know 

Recording: (2836/ 9621) 
she did not say anything i mean they would not let her 

Recording: (2837/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (2838/ 9621) 
uh huh 

Recording: (2839/ 9621) 
yeah well there is too many situations out there to have everybody fit into certain ones every one of them is different 

Recording: (2840/ 9621) 
what is different is my old neighborhood is just exactly the same and so from that angle i mean still is my elementary school sitting there i went to for nine years and then north is not being used as a high school but it is there a block away olentangy village i am right in where i always was i mean i was raised on como avenue and i live two blocks away from there now so i made a full circle there but columbus has changed in the downtown area and it is really neat you know compared to any other cities of course i loved oregon i was very rural for 18 years 

Recording: (2841/ 9621) 
oh no 

Recording: (2842/ 9621) 
it is in education it is top they produce a lot of graduate and undergraduate education business schools coming up like they are building a new building but i will be gone by the time it is done if i decide to stay so it will be so as far as education like for a small school and they just opened up their phd program in education and they are also known for political science but it is a real conservative political science and it it is a real conservative school and that does not really match my views on a lot of things it is dry they have real strict visitation policies things like that my thought is if you are considered an adult enough to move away then you should not have that many restrictions i can understand some because i remember when i was a freshman in college we did crazy things but still 

Recording: (2843/ 9621) 
south pacific 

Recording: (2844/ 9621) 
made you well aware of 

Recording: (2845/ 9621) 
i do not think that divorce is a bad thing i think that if you are married and you realize that you get to a point where you and this other person are not in a positive relationship for each other or for anybody else in your family that it is better to just say look this is not working we both deserve to be happy and go your own separate ways i think for me personally i would certainly try very hard to be in a situation where i would not end up getting divorced just because i think it makes things a little bit more difficult as far as coordinating coordinating things and i know that sounds kind of petty but just i mean i do not think it is i do not think it is bad but i think that that if you can find a way obviously to continue to make a relationship work that you should but my parents are very different 

Recording: (2846/ 9621) 
yeah you can take yeah i mean 

Recording: (2847/ 9621) 
everyone loses their funding 

Recording: (2848/ 9621) 
they said well since you are getting that we will cut your pay back to what you would normally draw under the apprenticeship program 

Recording: (2849/ 9621) 
i think yes especially this season 

Recording: (2850/ 9621) 
down on the golf that is nice beach but nothing that probably would compare to yours in australia gosh 

Recording: (2851/ 9621) 
she is interested in physical therapy is that what your wife is oh okay 

Recording: (2852/ 9621) 
it was not a huge shock it was not my first encounter with homosexuality 

Recording: (2853/ 9621) 
yeah i mean i can not say that there would be any difference with them 

Recording: (2854/ 9621) 
just mount tapes do printouts monitor systems if people have problems help solve them 

Recording: (2855/ 9621) 
오케이 

Recording: (2856/ 9621) 
and notice how they keep changing packages of your favorite article every now and then i said but when you get down to the meat of it it is the same thing and i said and that is where it comes down to the catholic church for example they can put all you can get folk masses you can do all this superficial stuff on a thing to make it more attractive and they do every religion makes it more attractive for it oh it is usually more comfortable well yeah but the bottom line is you are trying to still if you are a christian focus back to the bible 

Recording: (2857/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2858/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (2859/ 9621) 
and then there was another girl who i really did not think was that smart she is kind of inner blonde and she got in yeah 

Recording: (2860/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (2861/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2862/ 9621) 
you can find it all over the place 

Recording: (2863/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (2864/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2865/ 9621) 
and you went ahead and did it 

Recording: (2866/ 9621) 
so if i spend time away from cher i become unpopular 

Recording: (2867/ 9621) 
he was from brooklyn 

Recording: (2868/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (2869/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (2870/ 9621) 
my 

Recording: (2871/ 9621) 
it is weird i wish they would make it i do not wanna say free well i think they do make it free and i hate to say it but a little bit easier access because i do not think it will cause people to have more sex i think they are gonna have it anyhow so it would only be better and safer for them 

Recording: (2872/ 9621) 
oh we do too we make vegetable soup and chili 

Recording: (2873/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2874/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2875/ 9621) 
you know what i mean 

Recording: (2876/ 9621) 
to some extent yeah but to some extent no because see when i was in the service it was a different time 

Recording: (2877/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2878/ 9621) 
right right 

Recording: (2879/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (2880/ 9621) 
you have spelled every name you have read every name you have written every name practically there are not any that you have not heard of 

Recording: (2881/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (2882/ 9621) 
yeah well 

Recording: (2883/ 9621) 
i do believe i do believe and i think maybe i will ask you because you are one of the younger generation have not you had as you have grown older have not you looked back sometimes and said boy mom was right about that dad was right about that i think the older a child gets and that includes us too now that we are our age because we are i am almost as old as my mother was when she died i am older than my father was when he died i do believe i see now where just living life if you keep your eyes and ears open and your mind you got to have your mind open to receive what your eyes and ears are like i guess you learn things that you cannot possibly learn in a book in school they help they help you to teach that you should always keep your mind open in school but there is a lot of things you are just not going to learn except by actual experience and living life and i believe that that is a lot of right there because i know i started to say well you know i do not think i finished it i myself have these once getting only what i need versus all these little wants and desires because i grew up in the depression and did not have these things consequently i have got a doll collection a teddy bear collection an angel collection record collection you would not believe a whole one whole wall of my room with books and books in another room but then the books i started when the kids were little because they did read at home and the libraries were not near as easy to get to as they are nowadays and consequently i have kept the and it is amazing but some of those grandchildren almost all of them they come over to the house and if they get bored they will go over to the bookcase and start looking for something to read so it is good to have it available for them in the home to a certain extent now however my one son is gone too far he is got one room completely lined with books and a hallway full of books and i do not know if the kids ever go and pick those up or not because they are always going to the library so you see it is what is taught at home that really counts but we do not need all those material things and now i am sitting back and thinking well which one of my kids which one of my grandchildren are gonna keep this or shall i have an auction and spend the money and travel you see what i mean you change your opinions change as you get older and you begin to look back i do not think i was ever a spendthrift to the point that i did things foolishly some things i did do foolish but i mean you know on an overall basis 

Recording: (2884/ 9621) 
can you go up and like feed him 

Recording: (2885/ 9621) 
just general manners 

Recording: (2886/ 9621) 
and that is the generation i am talking about those are the generation that went through the depression and so forth they were the cash i feel sorry for your generation which is my daughter is generation and probably my son is because i do not see how in the heck wages are not going up that much prices consumerism is going up somewhere along the line the consumer is going to have to start getting a little wiser and say 

Recording: (2887/ 9621) 
it is very hard 

Recording: (2888/ 9621) 
oh the white ones okay 

Recording: (2889/ 9621) 
anything that was foreign in my bed and not knowing it it would wake me up especially i mean i think you kind of have a different level of awareness when you are a mother and you are sleeping in the bed with your infant because 

Recording: (2890/ 9621) 
oh you vacuumed oh it is so nice in here thank you and that is pretty good there are a lot of people out there that would not even notice of course then there are the days when i do not get around to it i know you must notice 

Recording: (2891/ 9621) 
yeah but it is their stupid laws 

Recording: (2892/ 9621) 
i said i did not want to see that i would much rather have my own opinion of what it is going to be like and go by what other people said 

Recording: (2893/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (2894/ 9621) 
oh okay 

Recording: (2895/ 9621) 
my dad is the only weird well some of his brothers and sisters are kinda out there too but 

Recording: (2896/ 9621)

Recording: (2897/ 9621) 
yeah there were some of them end up dropping out 

Recording: (2898/ 9621) 
trying to get that job 

Recording: (2899/ 9621) 
hmm 

Recording: (2900/ 9621) 
who can help you with that 

Recording: (2901/ 9621) 
is new stuff everyone can allow because a lot of the people in that group are paid i get paid it is kind of a semiprofessional aspect thing where you get paid per service but let us see so they have to balance the number of rehearsals they can pay people for with the amount of music that they want to do and this last year we played a movement of a schumann concert piece for four horns and orchestra and i was a little bit flabbergasted when i saw that on the schedule at the beginning of the year because it is really hard to play and i thought is he expecting us to play this the solos or is he expecting to bring in somebody 

Recording: (2902/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2903/ 9621) 
difficult exactly getting 

Recording: (2904/ 9621) 
hmm 

Recording: (2905/ 9621) 
yeah both my whole family all graduated megan was first in her class joe is ranked first my brother phillip is ranked first i was not however you know but they are all straight four point 

Recording: (2906/ 9621)

Recording: (2907/ 9621) 
i know it is amazing

Recording: (2909/ 9621) 
no it is in the ag college but why it is there i do not know it is a matter of how they fit it in there but it is dealing with construction management 

Recording: (2910/ 9621) 
but even so we were on this and the germans were up on the mountains all around us where they could again look right down at us so we did not go out in the daylight hardly at all

Recording: (2922/ 9621) 
been to do that 

Recording: (2923/ 9621) 
you are allowed to have guests of the same sex like i do not live in the dorms but assuming i did if i had a girl come from home to visit me i would have to either sneak her in and just hope we did not get caught or have her stay at a friend is 

Recording: (2924/ 9621) 
my roommate 

Recording: (2925/ 9621) 
the ultimate would probably be a parttime thing but neither one of our positions offer any type of parttime work we have some friends that do that where they only go two days a week or something which is they get a little bit of both the worlds 

Recording: (2926/ 9621) 
she is always trying to recruit people to come and visit her but it is like a two hour drive and then everybody is busy that is four hours of driving and i do not know it is just too hard to keep everybody in touch that way 

Recording: (2927/ 9621) 
i was at eugene and i was not even in eugene it was a hundred thousand you know and i loved that but then i came back and i live in olentangy village which is right on the river and it is very very scenic very beautiful 

Recording: (2928/ 9621) 
yes um-hum yeah i do miss that but at the same time i have you know i had a lot of opportunity to be there and to do those things so and i mean there are you know it is obviously you can not compare it but you know there are cultural things to do in columbus and it does sort of make me mad when you know people are kind of like oh columbus you know there is nothing to do there i find myself defending columbus a lot more now than 

Recording: (2929/ 9621) 
home ec yeah i am sure that was useful for people that did not cook or do anything showed them how to turn an oven on or 

Recording: (2930/ 9621) 
mmm yeah it was in 69s when i went in so you know you can kind of figure that it was that 

Recording: (2931/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (2932/ 9621) 
because there is no fear of being caught by the parents 

Recording: (2933/ 9621) 
so they sort of send them on their way or whatever and she did have the opportunity to come back 

Recording: (2934/ 9621)

i can not believe you came back 

Recording: (2940/ 9621) 
mmhmm um-hum 

Recording: (2941/ 9621) 
i talk to her every day 

Recording: (2942/ 9621) 
well i am lucky in that way because i get to travel a lot and so if there is something i really want to see chicago is not that far washington is not that far i do not get to new york that often but i still have access to a lot of stuff if i want to go to the trouble 

Recording: (2943/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2944/ 9621) 
so that is frustrating for me when you look at both of the candidates and you think i do not want either one of these people there should be a none of the above if there is that option i am sure a lot more

his daughter is 12 

Recording: (2947/ 9621) 
ah probably 

Recording: (2948/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (2949/ 9621) 
but now it seems like people are just like i do not know why that is a trend i mean my dad said he grew up in the bronx 

Recording: (2950/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (2951/ 9621) 
that is 

Recording: (2952/ 9621) 
so i almost bought one a couple weeks ago in fact i went into contract on it with this guy this dear old man it was for his mother who was in her 90s in a retirement home it was on royal forest which is north and i made this low offer and i never thought that they would i did not want it was kind of like i felt like i had to do this because if i was gonna get this house i should get it but i did not really want now because i have the baby coming and we are going to be busy and i did not want to get involved in it and so i made this offer and then he countered back you know i offered him 92 and he was asking 999 so he counted back at 96 and i said you know i thought i have to worry about he is never going to come to it so i wrote back and said you know i appreciate your offer but 92 92 is almost not feasible for me and 925 was really the only thing i could do and i did not even give him a time to respond because i just assumed i was just bowing out of it 

Recording: (2953/ 9621) 
i think it is probably some of both i think it is probably more social but i mean obviously they are gonna have different views on how things work but i mean for the most part i can not see that as being too big of a problem obviously there are more like violent guys out there and things like that than there are women but at the same time i would not say there is anything too overpowerful as far as the number of guys being out there that are violent i mean it is something that unfortunately does happen but it is more how you are brought up whether you can control it or not 

Recording: (2954/ 9621) 
mmm 

Recording: (2955/ 9621) 
oh that is almost as bad as rosie cozy i have a 

Recording: (2956/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2957/ 9621) 
i just was going down like 

Recording: (2958/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2959/ 9621) 
and you kind of knew everybody around the neighborhood but i think that that is still the same for the neighborhood that my family lives in so i do not think me personally other than the fact that maybe there is a couple more things to do there is bigger more comfortable movie theaters and that kind of stuff it has not really 

Recording: (2960/ 9621) 
usually she is looking for something to eat you know 

Recording: (2961/ 9621) 
sometimes i think it is been a very bad influence on certain aspects of life on others i think it is been very good because at least it lets us know what is going on in the rest of the world and if it were not for that some of the things we would not know and i think that as you increase your knowledge you are far better off than to stay in this little hole over here and this is all i want to know about 

Recording: (2962/ 9621) 
yeah now 

Recording: (2963/ 9621) 
parties did not change at all

it is really cool yeah yeah 

Recording: (2968/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (2969/ 9621) 
i think they can help but i think it has to be something that society in general our family 

Recording: (2970/ 9621) 
put bathrooms and kitchens and stuff 

Recording: (2971/ 9621) 
i think columbus is really interesting how it develops compared to i do not know just how indianapolis how columbus is a real standard midwest city just how it is designed and laid out compared to philadelphia or just when it was settled and when it was made just how more the streets are more it is all planned out more as opposed to in philly or places like that that more east coast it is like the roads parts of them are real small and like and other parts are all hilly and curving around and stuff and so that is kind of interesting i mean i think it is also i like the urban sprawl of columbus how this is just the suburbs develop and how it is like more of a metropolitan area as opposed to a centralized area that is really big like columbus downtown is really odd too i mean there is nothing to do down there it is all businesses and like the couple shops that are down there close at like six i mean there is like a couple restaurants or something but i mean it is different when you think of other cities you know it is more of like a downtown is where you go to hang out but here it is like campus or more of a 

Recording: (2972/ 9621) 
but i mean it was nothing too serious or violent 

Recording: (2973/ 9621) 
so everybody is trying to be like everyone else 

Recording: (2974/ 9621) 
oh you do not ask an easy one do you that is really a 

Recording: (2975/ 9621) 
they do not wear like the loud hawaiian shirts and the shorts and the cameras do they 

Recording: (2976/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (2977/ 9621) 
not that they could have stopped it but they should have known what was going on i really think if they were close with their children they would have known something was wrong especially with these kids who are so removed and do not talk to their parents and start dressing certain ways you know that they are going to turning a different you know i just i blame them though 

Recording: (2978/ 9621) 
yeah i hear 

Recording: (2979/ 9621) 
yeah which is good for me because i do not ever go there anyway 

Recording: (2980/ 9621) 
and you do not have to worry if she writes her name backwards like a mirror image 

Recording: (2981/ 9621) 
and then once a month we will have a leadership module which is the business ethics part and you know goal setting and that type of thing and then once a month we will just have like donato is pizza and like just discuss basic and just general things like events coming up we had we planted the flowers at muirfield last weekend and the weekend before i do not know i can not wait for it to start just because i want to watch it on tv i am like i planted those you see the jack nicklaus golf statue in front of the clubhouse i planted the flowers around that no i do not want to watch it for the golf at all i just want to turn it on and see it occasionally 

Recording: (2982/ 9621) 
nobody around nothing but land 

Recording: (2983/ 9621) 
i would not 

Recording: (2984/ 9621) 
yeah i do i really do i mean these kids are getting guns a lot of them is from their parents but it is amazing how many guns and they say that the police are selling guns to people and they do not realize you know they are old guns that they confiscate and they do not realize where they are going i mean that amazes me but there is always going to be the underworld in different ways that kids and people can get guns and it is sad i do not know how we could ever limit that but there is so many millions of guns in the world that you are wondering where are they all coming from but i think laws can help especially with children and they have these new guns that not just a safety lock but it is like an identification thing 

Recording: (2985/ 9621) 
oh really 

Recording: (2986/ 9621) 
oh that was a football game deal 

Recording: (2987/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2988/ 9621) 
and yet we sit down and negotiate for it and then on top of it those people that participate in the sponsors are just as bad 

Recording: (2989/ 9621) 
excuse me well typically what i observed is conflict you know with mom most of the time well i think a lot of times when there is a stepfather involved you know that becomes a problem for some of them but they said you know you might run into a case where you know the family is abusing the child you know but i did not run into that 

Recording: (2990/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (2991/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (2992/ 9621) 
that is why it is mainly appealing to instate people they pay you to go to school 

Recording: (2993/ 9621) 
you know and they did want the children 

Recording: (2994/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (2995/ 9621) 
this fall is the first time i will be submitting my portfolio 

Recording: (2996/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (2997/ 9621) 
no i do really believe that if they would have something like that instead of some of the even those shows are no good even for older people to watch they aggravate me sometimes i turn them off for some of the stupid things they do 

Recording: (2998/ 9621) 
great yeah it was like oh this makes sense and he might have these other wonderful things that i am used to but he is got all of this so i will get that little slice and take the rest so that worked out 

Recording: (2999/ 9621) 
watching it for a while period and then since deep space nine left i needed a little star trek fix every once in a while so i started watching it i also do not have cable so it is on upn and 53 does not come in terribly well so i mean sometimes it is like i do not want to kind of see what is going on 

Recording: (3000/ 9621) 
i was interested in going out to california and i have been out there several times but it was supposed to be tight why was not i interested in moving out with my mother

heh heh 

Recording: (3005/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (3006/ 9621) 
we should look at it as a sport 

Recording: (3007/ 9621) 
yeah yeah because if she was there charging her two bucks down there and i told her i says you need to really not get $20 out at a time because i said you need to get like 60 or 80 because it says you get 80 bucks out you are gonna pay $8 for it 20 bucks at a time but if you get 80 bucks out you are gonna get two bucks and she goes but if i have $80 i will spend it and i says well you have a footlocker with a lock on it put $70 in there and have 10 on you and oh and i said the only reason i know that is because that is what dad is got to do i said i can not carry money or i will spend it you know 

Recording: (3008/ 9621) 
that he remembers he remembers the stepfathers and that kind of thing it is just not a good stuff 

Recording: (3009/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3010/ 9621)

mmhmm 

Recording: (3013/ 9621) 
it was like five or six different doctors so she is learned a lot more now the cancer because she is never been in oncology at all so it was always just trauma patients or open heart bypass patients things like that so it is been a whole new learning experience for her too 

Recording: (3014/ 9621) 
here 

Recording: (3015/ 9621)

um i am a lutheran and a lot of what he says about everyone going to hell 

Recording: (3020/ 9621) 
so i think she is getting a better education than he did but it is because she is doing the work and she knows she is expected to and has to my son is the kind he would rather play than work and so he wrote a lot 

Recording: (3021/ 9621) 
that is it 

Recording: (3022/ 9621) 
i was only on the op a few times but one time we had a second lieutenant up there who was very congenial i guess is a good word is not he

well you can carry a weapon here in columbus i can carry a weapon right now as long as it is out in the open 

Recording: (3027/ 9621) 
yeah a lot more 

Recording: (3028/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (3029/ 9621) 
took a lot of time 

Recording: (3030/ 9621) 
yeah yeah i think it was just a political thing 

Recording: (3031/ 9621) 
now parked over here on the a section goes back and 

Recording: (3032/ 9621) 
like there would be kids saying yes maam yes maam yes maam in class and then they are out there smoking at the cars or cutting school and stuff 

Recording: (3033/ 9621) 
and it would take like years i would think to implement the program successfully 

Recording: (3034/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (3035/ 9621) 
mmhmm life skills 

Recording: (3036/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (3037/ 9621) 
so like there is not a lot you can really do with that 

Recording: (3038/ 9621) 
no then you would not be too familiar with everything 

Recording: (3039/ 9621) 
or crazy 

Recording: (3040/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3041/ 9621)

i have no idea where he was and at the time my motherinlaw was in a nursing home and had alzheimer is and my fatherinlaw was in the hospital 

Recording: (3043/ 9621) 
they have a whole listing of numbers of reasons why you do not want to do it most usually i just put location i do not want to go certain places 

Recording: (3044/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3045/ 9621) 
i think it is because when i was a sophomore in high school before it dawned on me that tab a and slot b had any relation to this stuff that we were learning with the charts and the diagrams but i think kids are a lot more aware now because of what they are exposed to in movies and everything tv just daily life they are a lot more aware they go into it with a lot of myths and misapprehensions but they definitely have thoughts about it and i think they need to know 

Recording: (3046/ 9621) 
yeah like when i need things and i call him up i need diapers i need wipes i need $20 yeah he is there for me for that financially yeah he is always been there for me 

Recording: (3047/ 9621) 
with their eye or the car accident 

Recording: (3048/ 9621) 
like on a fairly regular basis even 

Recording: (3049/ 9621) 
it is about the size of a very small hotel room and then it is got a separate bathroom with a big bathtub there is a little box on the wall about this big that has some smelly stuff coming out of it there is enough room where people can come in and sit down there is a foldout couch bed for whoever is in there with you and they keep the baby right there in the room with you after it is born 

Recording: (3050/ 9621) 
it was during school you would go there you went there for two years your junior and senior year and like your junior you would go in the morning and your senior you would go in the afternoon but it took up pretty much your whole day half of your day actually you are at the career center then you go back 

Recording: (3051/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (3052/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (3053/ 9621) 
just because it was more like they seemed like they wanted to be there as opposed to i am just doing this because i do not know why or whatever and it seems like too i hate it when people it is obvious that if they did not have the textbook they would not know how to do it where if people did not have their notes they would not be able to do it themselves so i think and like you know put a lot of effort into making it not the same every day and not just like a lecture and when we do homework and turn it in like you know it is like we do like like a history class we do like role role playing things and like 

Recording: (3054/ 9621) 
yeah exactly which is one of the things i ran into architecture where i mean we only had you know one or two papers we had to write 

Recording: (3055/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3056/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (3057/ 9621)

Recording: (3058/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (3059/ 9621) 
but it is a smaller catholic school in st louis 

Recording: (3060/ 9621) 
they just can not single out what i should attend to and what i should screen out so they attend to everything equally the train going by out here the teacher talking up here the kid over here shuffling his papers this kid back here picking up his pencil and so they get a little bit of everything and they do not learn anything 

Recording: (3061/ 9621) 
and there is people like that today still but i think people should go to retirement centers and sit down make a visit to them every week make a part of their life and develop a friendship 

Recording: (3062/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (3063/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3064/ 9621) 
yeah i think they are trying to do more i am hoping they will

no commitment if these guys have commitment and you see the guys out there they want to go further possibly in their careers and professionals others want to maybe fulfill something whatever it is you ask each individual what it is that drives you and that is the thing i get so perturbed with interviewers they ask somebody and somebody comes back and says you know what i mean yeah what did he no get inside the guy is mind what did he mean you know what i mean yeah no i do not know what you mean play dumb pull it out of him what do you mean michael red what do you plan on doing after school when i was growing up they used to give the grade point average and the major of the student athlete

Recording: (3088/ 9621) 
oh sure 

Recording: (3089/ 9621) 
you are doing fine 

Recording: (3090/ 9621) 
i probably would like said just mainly more for the education standpoint of it 

Recording: (3091/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3092/ 9621) 
i am not 

Recording: (3093/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3094/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3095/ 9621) 
and i have got friends that do that and i just i do not feel right i do not wanna see my kid seeing all these different guys coming around and stuff there is no way uhuh 

Recording: (3096/ 9621) 
mmhmm yeah 

Recording: (3097/ 9621) 
i know those are your hauls 

Recording: (3098/ 9621) 
so we are kind of doing that and then i figure i am probably going to wait tables at night and finish going to school during the day 

Recording: (3099/ 9621) 
well he is exporting cars illegally 

Recording: (3100/ 9621) 
i was raised 

Recording: (3101/ 9621) 
that is yeah it is developmental because by the did you know the reason they picked the age five to start school is because that is when some expert thought that one hemisphere or the other was dominant but now they found out that the full dominance does not take over until about age eight 

Recording: (3102/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (3103/ 9621) 
that is a big growing period you know from junior high to high school is when you really learn and try to decide what you want to do with your life my mother was always home she was which was good to come home to because i had friends whose parent mothers were not there and they had to clean they had to start dinner and they hated it you know i mean and they feel that they kind of missed out on things but i think you know kids a lot of them who have when parents have money and both parents worked i am not sure if the combine if both parents worked but i do not think just the mother being home there would have totally helped no 

Recording: (3104/ 9621) 
death 

Recording: (3105/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (3106/ 9621) 
ha ha ha 

Recording: (3107/ 9621) 
but her mother stayed with us for several two or three years and she was the babysitter for our oldest boy 

Recording: (3108/ 9621) 
and it really is not though because i think it is actually it is really freeing not to have to drink and all these things so you just kind of i feel like i can get along with any people and so it does not really exclude you from anyone unless you would let it i guess and nobody is perfect i mean everybody has their prejudices i guess and fears so getting over that is part of life for everyone 

Recording: (3109/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (3110/ 9621) 
yeah so did you see pain you just sort of followed somebody around yeah i saw the patients in the morning 

Recording: (3111/ 9621) 
i am a freelance artist illustrator in fact marketing communications for ohio state is one of my big clients and i also have various parttime jobs for the medical insurance 

Recording: (3112/ 9621) 
i know it is connected to england because i guess england owned it once 

Recording: (3113/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (3114/ 9621) 
it did not hurt me none you know i think just depends upon like i said a lot of factors you know it is your neighborhood your neighbors most kids do not have nothing to do in their neighborhood even you know how many empty lots do you see nowadays it still comes back to like when i was a kid we had gokarts we had many bikes we had all that kind of stuff 

Recording: (3115/ 9621) 
there is a lot more in college college it is seven nights a week 

Recording: (3116/ 9621) 
mmhmm and some conservative values too you know that the republicans are supposed to represent but i do not think they are doing a very good job of that 

Recording: (3117/ 9621) 
it is not a presidential issue a candidate issue as far as i am concerned 

Recording: (3118/ 9621) 
yeah or him so was this guy who took the necklace was he black or was he white 

Recording: (3119/ 9621) 
i do not see any reason for it myself but that is interesting when the time began according to my what i believe in and everything it was man and woman got married and the reason they got married is because of procreation to keep the population going i think that is the way it was set up originally so i have no problem with a man being with a man or a woman being with a woman but if that was the relationship for everybody 

Recording: (3120/ 9621) 
motherly instinct towards you know and they are like oh eric you should have one and you know and he knows that one i just knew at a young age i have always loved the animals 

Recording: (3121/ 9621) 
katie really 

Recording: (3122/ 9621) 
see and i can not eat seafood but i tried some once when i went to las vegas with my dad and we did not really have it my mom did not cook it at home which i am kind of glad she did not the smell of fish always kind of bothered me but until i tried some crab meat and lobster and within five minutes i broke out into a rash i mean it was like a heat rash i mean it started on my neck 

Recording: (3123/ 9621) 
so i figure it is much better to be nice to them because there is also times when everybody makes errors and maybe one of these times you make an error and i tell you to turn one way and you go there is an airplane over there and i tell you to turn that way and i really meant for you to turn left instead of right and you may come back and go do you mean left or right there and i go yes that is correct turn left so everybody helps you know i feel kindness goes a long way and the pilots the same way most often they are you know pretty decent 

Recording: (3124/ 9621) 
well i used to 

Recording: (3125/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (3126/ 9621) 
yeah to me that is sort of a slap on the wrist and you tell the parents what you have done that the kid did and you do not want him to do it again and let it go they suspended him i do not know if of course i will probably say this i got this version of this story from the columbus dispatch so it is probably not the whole story yeah it is 

Recording: (3127/ 9621) 
it is that is why i quit 

Recording: (3128/ 9621) 
it is like we do not have one at home because we are worried 

Recording: (3129/ 9621) 
yeah because i have a problem with getting to know people i am shy at first 

Recording: (3130/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (3131/ 9621) 
mmmm 

Recording: (3132/ 9621) 
yeah that is pretty much what we was made to do back in the pioneer days you did not have this crap with the kid going get fix me some canned ravioli you gave that kid a shotgun he went out there and killed his own meals that is an interesting thing i just saw in the paper in the newsweek i was reading that and 

Recording: (3133/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (3134/ 9621) 
and psychology 

Recording: (3135/ 9621) 
which i feel has been completely devoiced in america because of the effects of the cold war i have inherited this world where there were of where am i going with this i mean the generation before us had like vietnam they protested against it i mean they were in many ways protesting against the generation before but when it came down to it i mean what was the protest really about i am not being clear because i am not exactly sure where i am going with this i am very cynical about the world i have inherited because i see a world in which my political views have been silenced by 50 years of international politics and propaganda that says to be left of a certain point is bad like among conservative circles the word liberal is like almost like calling someone a communist in the 40s whereas i am very cynical about that because i feel that it was not it is been a cultural process that has been developed and now i am being handed this current situation which which i see as completely unfair i mean i think the reason that our generation is cynical the reason i am cynical is because we are handed a world in which we see the injustices of the past or not the the hypocrisy i mean i guess injustice also applies in terms of things like the cold war and stuff that is why i am cynical i hope that answers your question at least a little bit i do not know i feel kind of preachy like this is my position 

Recording: (3136/ 9621) 
taking classes hopefully that is when you go to the dentist and you know you catch up on all that stuff too 

Recording: (3137/ 9621) 
no no that is where have you been shit 

Recording: (3138/ 9621) 
i am 

Recording: (3139/ 9621) 
was a man 

Recording: (3140/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (3141/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (3142/ 9621) 
that is number three i have a very general opposition to this kind of i do not think we should be helping anybody else to which is the largest one in the state of ohio now but i am talking places like washington courthouse which maybe have 15000 or wadsworth which maybe have 18000 this kinds of things being developed on the peripheral of the cities is just totally destroying those and a consequence i feel it is breaking our society down to the point where we do not know our neighbors at all anymore it is quite common anymore that if you go three houses down you have no idea who those folks are how they feel what they might do for you or you can do for them and that all applies to the polaris question as i see it and i think also that it is a very very major financial gain for the developers who are doing it and it is going to therefore harm the many many areas that it affected such as north north north north north what is the name of the shop north what northland yeah northland i can not even say that okay 

Recording: (3143/ 9621) 
i was a kid that had battles with the bands at the mall 

Recording: (3144/ 9621) 
oh boy they are just really fun people to deal with 

Recording: (3145/ 9621) 
yeah because i mean five years went by like 

Recording: (3146/ 9621) 
now 

Recording: (3147/ 9621) 
hehe 

Recording: (3148/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3149/ 9621) 
well that is right now a lot of it 

Recording: (3150/ 9621) 
they will go over well oh we do not care how we are going to do that we just want five guys out there in the court and so forth but we are not going to nah we lost one two academics this year i do not know why but we have got four guys in the class that is ok that is divorce that is our attitude 

Recording: (3151/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3152/ 9621) 
mmhmm yeah 

Recording: (3153/ 9621) 
and i understand that mentality now because i went back but i will tell you the reason i left was it sounds stupid but he took my teddy bear which i loved and i have had for not since i was a child but at least five years at that time and he just he knew i loved it 

Recording: (3154/ 9621) 
that is going to well it might make national news i just 

Recording: (3155/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (3156/ 9621) 
you were past ready yeah 

Recording: (3157/ 9621)

well i mean i would not i would not say it was an hour at a time but yeah and he loves playing on the computer doing cd roms and loves watching the magic school bus 

Recording: (3159/ 9621) 
oh because i was going to say when you are talking about traveling you will be able to get him to have a job where he can do lots of traveling i know i am like my husband goes to europe and goes to california every month and he goes as little as possible but the point is if we wanted to be traveling he could be going a lot more a lot longer now he just goes for a couple days time just to get back here because i do not like him to have to go he does not want to be away from us but your husband you will be in a position he can latch onto something where you will be able to have lots of opportunities to travel 

Recording: (3160/ 9621) 
plus the mental health aspect of it and everything 

Recording: (3161/ 9621) 
sort of make their own decision when they got older what they wanted to do or they wanted to go with it 

Recording: (3162/ 9621) 
no i worked at the library when i was a student 

Recording: (3163/ 9621)

Recording: (3168/ 9621) 
mmm 

Recording: (3169/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3170/ 9621) 
yeah yeah it is right around here 

Recording: (3171/ 9621) 
yes i just do not i am not comfortable with another man being around my son like that so i mean if i dated i mean you know i am just taking it i just i do not know i have not felt i have went out a couple times but i will not let it get serious or you know no same night nothing like that goes on 

Recording: (3172/ 9621) 
but then he disowned me so it does not matter 

Recording: (3173/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (3174/ 9621) 
the simplest things 

Recording: (3175/ 9621) 
well we figure in a few years he will 

Recording: (3176/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (3177/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (3178/ 9621) 
well i think they tried to get some kind of a deal with when they were planning this thing with with the high state to you know like had the shot stain center down at down closer to downtown or or something like and play happier ball games there or something like that but but i do not need that you know they got their own stuff so 

Recording: (3179/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3180/ 9621) 
well i do not think they should be responsible i think kids go to school and they need role models good teachers and i think schools have gotten a lot better about that it seemed like in the late 80s early 90s you know the schools a lot of them were really bad i think finally the education department or whatever is realizing that parents need help with their kids they can not do everything and they just need really positive things when they do go to school and i think teachers are a big part of it i really do you remember when you have a good teacher and that you have learned a lot and i think through education because it is hard all these schools in so many rural areas and everything try to get good teachers and then you know it is always has to do with money and them not making enough money which the teachers do not make enough money and they are overworked in all these big large classrooms it just seems to me when kids start dressing and getting in a clique together you know it would be hard for them to intervene and say oh what is going on in your life what is your what is the problem you know that is that is not really should be their role but if they care enough they should call their parents and say look we are worried about your son he misses a lot of school or he is starting to dress really you know sometimes and it should not be that dress has a lot to do with it but it seems when kids go a different way it does involve dress and just you know turning against the norm of the society you know and if they do not want to be in sports that is fine there is so many different things that they can do in school and learn about arts and music and you know but unfortunately i think a lot more pressure is on schools to more or less pick up the slack of what the parents can not do but in some ways it is always kind of been like that i mean it was like you went to school and they took care of you until you got home you know i mean 

Recording: (3181/ 9621) 
getting so congested that is what i do not like 

Recording: (3182/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (3183/ 9621) 
and it is like i like how it is like i thought about going to antioch but it was really expensive and like i do not know but just because it is in schools more of a nontraditional type where they give you like evaluations and you do not get grades so then that is what i heard it is like in antioch where the professor writes a couple page paper on your performance on the quarter and that really shows that i mean that is a lot of work work for the professor but that really shows that he is really involved in noticing what you are doing as opposed to just some kid in his class 

Recording: (3184/ 9621) 
well there is been quite a change in the attitude of the general public i think as far as women working away from home is concerned and i do not know i am glad that my wife was able to work there at home well actually she worked in an office when our first boy was just small 

Recording: (3185/ 9621) 
well in 

Recording: (3186/ 9621)

Recording: (3190/ 9621) 
uh huh 

Recording: (3191/ 9621)

Recording: (3192/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (3193/ 9621) 
yeah i could 

Recording: (3194/ 9621) 
it is where bioinformatics was about a year or two ago 

Recording: (3195/ 9621) 
and i tell them writing is not an event it is a process it is like getting your braces put on you go in one time and they might pull a couple teeth and you go in the next time they might put that little wire on and you go in the next time they might put the lower ones on or part of them and the next time then they put on more and then one time they will tighten them a little but it is a process that happens over a period of three years it is not an event they think they can sit down and write okay i am done i am like i do not think so writing is a process 

Recording: (3196/ 9621) 
for the medical insurance 

Recording: (3197/ 9621) 
but it is like a democracy over there in australia they do not have a king and queen 

Recording: (3198/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (3199/ 9621) 
yeah and there is a certain amount of gun laws that i actually did not get into until i saw that here in ohio it is with a long gun or a handgun you have to be 18 but other places like texas there is no minimum age on owning a rifle or a handgun you are looking like god man you pack just imagine this little six year old walking into the store packing oh man 

Recording: (3200/ 9621) 
i do 

Recording: (3201/ 9621)

Recording: (3205/ 9621) 
before that i worked at channel 4 tv station for about five years 

Recording: (3206/ 9621) 
or been around but i think doctors should more look on that avenue that possibly it is something else like that i have never had a doctor well now with the forms you fill out with your physicians and they ask you if you know about allergies and usually it is prescriptions and things that you have taken but i do not know i think a lot of things have to do with food allergies anymore i really do 

Recording: (3207/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (3208/ 9621) 
ok now i have dover ferry to bruges belgium and then train

he never said a thing again like okay we went for the big bucks we went for the time off everybody makes their choices now you got to live with them 

Recording: (3211/ 9621) 
politics i mean we grew up or came of age after the cold war was over i am very cynical about this i have a fairly leftist political stance 

Recording: (3212/ 9621) 
it is but that was good for new albany to have that i mean i think it was great to have it there and i think a lot of people did enjoy going there because there is not very many women is tournaments that come around here 

Recording: (3213/ 9621) 
she would pamper the kids and well from where we lived we lived just off i do not know whether you are acquainted with the north end of columbus but anyway indianola avenue is one of the main thoroughfares and we lived about a block and a half off of indianola and then just another block was a small shopping center where there was a drugstore and a barber shop and a tencent store theater i forget a couple other shops and when orin was about i do not know five or maybe six or seven years old he had been explicitly told that he was not to go up there at all so one day grandma gave him i do not know a quarter or something and that burned his pocket till i do not know whether he went up with another neighbor kid or whether he went up on his own but he went up to the store and i think i do not know whether mary went up and got him or what anyway she found out he was up there so when i came home she told me what had happened i said well that just can not be so i took him downstairs and paddled him there had never been anything more said about it since then 

Recording: (3214/ 9621) 
it behaved that way as a result of the way it was being treated by human beings so i mean there is i mean yeah the animal therapy is a very good thing my dog has been very supportive and very you know like you said the unconditional love part you know i mean how you could you could you could leave for a week and come back and they are they are like okay i am glad you are back you know 

Recording: (3215/ 9621)

Recording: (3219/ 9621) 
i was not born here but i was raised here 

Recording: (3220/ 9621) 
so that is basically what we have been doing we have been progressing for 15 years and i am proud to say that our state agency is probably the only agency other than maybe this highway patrol we work a lot with them but i think we are the only ones that have their own wiring cable people 

Recording: (3221/ 9621) 
or grow up and discover boys either way 

Recording: (3222/ 9621) 
i mean you kind of suffer your own consequences more rather than having society like yell at you for it 

Recording: (3223/ 9621) 
see you in smallpox 

Recording: (3224/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (3225/ 9621)

yeah 

Recording: (3227/ 9621) 
saw a lot of stuff like that and met a lot of people 

Recording: (3228/ 9621) 
and if i was in the same situation i would be doing the same thing 

Recording: (3229/ 9621) 
इह हूँ 

Recording: (3230/ 9621) 
i think it was more just a family preference i preferred family

and that was pretty done 

Recording: (3232/ 9621) 
gear your writing for a fourth grader and everyone will that you everybody that is going to read the memo will be able to read it

yeah he says a lot of racial slurs like that he is really homophobic 

Recording: (3241/ 9621) 
yeah i thought that was interesting so it is a values you know the christian values thing i do not have a problem with it we had little problems like my son had to learn the hail mary and we had to find somebody to teach it to us write it down for us because we did not know and they wrote it down wrong so he learned it wrong and he got marks off and we did not know yeah little things like that but it was not a problem there was a problem with my son for a while because the priest they had there would not let him take communion and all the other kids were taking communion and that is pretty much the priest decides that and he felt singled out and he was i mean he was the only one and he was uncomfortable with that but it has not been a problem i am not a religious person myself but i am not against it and maybe i have justified it to myself by saying well they are teaching values 

Recording: (3242/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3243/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (3244/ 9621) 
although janet you just said yesterday that people are so overweight in columbus because there is not very much to do that actually 

Recording: (3245/ 9621) 
yeah and because i back when i was in high school in my ap government class i was paying attention a lot you know like i read the columbus dispatch every day and i read us news and world report for my economics class and i was totally caught up with everything

Recording: (3254/ 9621) 
and that is essentially what the supreme court said in their last decision on this two three years ago what they said was whether we think it is right or wrong whether we think the previous supreme court was right or wrong it is been a part of this fabric of this country for more than 10 years and to reverse it would create too much too many problems for people you know which i thought was a nice way of saying sorry folks but you know it is too late 

Recording: (3255/ 9621) 
i do not know maybe i think maybe if teachers just their status in society is not real high when it should be it is more i mean i have heard that garbage men get paid more than teachers you know and how but it so it is just like people always talk about education for the you know we gotta think about our child is future or whatever but really teachers are paid crap and do not really get a lot of respect from anybody professors and stuff get more of a respect but it is just the teachers that you have especially in elementary school in critical periods in your life especially in adolescence too really influence how you are as a person people do not take that for granted a lot if you have bad teachers in one subject you are going to hate that subject if you have good teachers you are going to love it it really influences what you want to do with your life and people do not really acknowledge that too much 

Recording: (3256/ 9621)

Recording: (3257/ 9621)

Recording: (3260/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (3261/ 9621) 
and he does have a responsibility but i think there could be a line drawn to how responsible he is and how capable the other half would have been you know 

Recording: (3262/ 9621) 
because the mother he played her because he was with me and you know if and she just was like forget him i do not want him to be around my child and the other one she is older she is they she is like 10 and he says that because his daughter do not call you like she only calls for when she wants things so he does not you know he will get whatever he can for when she calls but he does not spend time with her

Recording: (3267/ 9621) 
plays and just things that are different my sociology and psychology teacher he was the same guy that taught history and he was real good too it was really crazy obviously but it is just interesting the sociology of high school and having a sociology class about it

into the hilltop area 

Recording: (3270/ 9621)

yeah 

Recording: (3273/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (3274/ 9621) 
i am not sure yet at least based on money raised it looks like george w could trample almost anybody but george w had not gotten out there in the fray yet and given too many answers to issues he talks about compassionate conservatism and i do not know what that means i want answers to specific questions as to what does compassionate conservative mean but i do not think that i am average in that i do not go for the slick image it bothers me he has the potential of trampling gore i think that gore will be the nominee no matter what bradley does gore has it sewn up because he is the insider 

Recording: (3275/ 9621) 
oh i was going to say it would be interesting 

Recording: (3276/ 9621)

Recording: (3281/ 9621) 
in most school districts it is comparable to any other job now it used to always be low but like a beginning teacher in worthington starts at i think 268 or something of course worthington is one of the three highest paid districts in ohio but it used to be that teachers just got paid lower than a starting fireman or a starting policeman you know in a sense you are out there risking your life every day too 

Recording: (3282/ 9621) 
you know guards up there looking down the watchtowers yeah you could feel it and to see it different is really cool you can look it up and say has anybody got their sights on me yeah yeah because that is like the world war ii stuff there is like remains i am sure but it is like if you get to see the wall it is like there i mean i am sure there is like there is from what i understand it was like you know that is like the world war ii stuff you know there is like remains i am sure it is like you get to see the wall it is like i am sure there is like from what i understand it was like you know concertina wire and barbed wire and all those like a big big brick wall and whatever you can actually you know still see it unless they tore it down okay just like to preserve the history of it okay wow so you actually it is neat like because you were like a part of that history at least when you were over there you feel like wow i was you know something to tell your daughter who is like i was there she goes scotland see now i am like i am like depressed because like man i guess i gave you a few months here now i want to just get you know it is like when you get psyched up i have not decided okay because i for a while yeah there is a lot of places to teach english overseas i might not be coming back anytime soon really not in australia they have it pretty a native speaker and apparently people have gone there and made just lots of money they teach a lot they make tons of money save it all and then they go travel again and then after the money runs out they come back and then start up teaching wow that is fantastic so that is not a thing you do not have to have you have to have a doctorate or any sort of credentials whatsoever as long as you can talk the talk yeah if you have a master is they will pay you more but usually you get a master is in english teaching it costs a lot of money but they will hire people as long as you speak english really they will teach you the teaching part they will give you materials well they would not put you in front of a 250person lecture hall would they well i do not know how to teach it but i would have a teacher class or another language class that would be hard that would be a challenge so yeah it is not a shame they are going to be like spanish instructors no i never thought about that some people studying spanish into like teaching classes but i was like well i did not know if that was like true or not that you can actually teach around the world because i have heard stories you know yeah you can people will pay i am like but why but it is like yeah like a 40 hour week where you would be okay okay so you think it is just like one on one where you just like sit like us doing or it is like in a classroom setting you just have like a group conversation okay okay so there is definitely work available if you want to pursue it did you visit spain while you were there because that is one of the places i want to 

Recording: (3283/ 9621) 
and socially too i mean mostly adhd and ld kids are emotionally immature as well so like the songs that their friends are listening to and their friends are maybe ready to think about girls and they are still acting like a fifth grader you know they are not interested in girls and they are still listening to music that younger kids would like they are just generally socially they mature a little slower it takes them longer to catch up

Recording: (3347/ 9621) 
he was tough but he was always tough and we did not realize it for years we did not have anything to compare it to he is the only one kid we got the psychologist told us that we were talking about things that happened when he was growing up he said you must have had a terrible time growing up raising him because he was not an easy kid we did not know any different

Recording: (3370/ 9621) 
yeah oh and that is good for the baby too 

Recording: (3371/ 9621) 
maybe we are beyond that we should not always be saying that

that is really hard to say if she was a younger woman and ran the campaign that she ran negatives do not work in columbus columbus really does have a heart and that just does not play in columbus what plays in the state and the people who ran her campaign ran voinovich is campaign and betty montgomery is campaign and that negative stuff worked statewide it does not work so well in columbus i think even a younger woman who ran that particular campaign would have lost and i like to think that age does not matter but she came across as old to me also and i like to think i am not prejudiced on any issue but if there is someone who had been right on on the issues i do not care if she was old i would have voted for her she just did not support the issues i supported she was wrong on i did not like that she tried to use the police chief in such a negative way by saying that coleman had voted for a raise for the chief well yes he voted for a raise for a chief but he voted for a raise for the police officers it is just that you know the police chief was tied to his and i do not like people who try to manipulate facts and that was manipulating the facts i did not like that she was against the tif in polaris once it was voted i thought it was more important whether it was right or wrong wrong and i do not think it was wrong to begin with but once it was voted and in place i thought her reputation was on the line and for her to try to use another divisive issue just to get elected did not sit well with me so i do not even if she had a lot of charisma charisma does not mean as much to me as a person is standard 

Recording: (3452/ 9621) 
mmm

Recording: (3483/ 9621) 
yeah i bet you i am sure those kids probably had problems because i mean i was like the very i was a very depressed kid too when i was a teenager like always wanted to kill myself and stuff you know i just maybe i am not sure because i do not know how their parents were it could have been could have been the people they were hanging around that you you know 

Recording: (3484/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (3485/ 9621) 
and actually in order to get in my room you have to be tested by the school psychologist and you have to qualify as a learning disability kid in other words the way you qualify in the state of ohio is you have a 30point discrepancy between your actual iq and your daily performance in other words let us say you have 100 iq but in all of your classes you are performing like a 70 iq person would so if there is a 30point discrepancy in there and people see that you are bright but yet you are just not getting it you are not able to write answers like you could say or you are not able to read things that other 7th graders can read that kind of clues us in and then the regular ed or somebody refers the child for testing and then if they qualify for help then we you know they go to my room for certain classes most of my kids i have them for reading and english 

Recording: (3486/ 9621) 
they had one i was just heard news this morning they were talking about some guy who is like 77 years old for kenyon college or something was throwing erasers at there

mhm 

Recording: (3490/ 9621) 
so do you hate microsoft now i mean there are operating systems that people have not even heard of that were the thing in their days i mean a lot of people know what a commodore 64 is they have heard of it but they really do not know what a brilliant system it was at its initial stage and it just got bowled over because you know something better came out something better will come out than windows microsoft will eventually go under it is just going to take a while oh yeah i give it probably about six or seven years before somebody comes out with a system that is just as good as microsoft do you think linux is going to linux i do not know i think linux will be around forever just because it is such a stable system it is a no a lot yeah it seems like it did not do as good as nearly as good as they thought it was gonna do if it did okay it is still around it just did not do as good as i thought it was gonna do dumb morons what idiot does not put a three and a half drive on hell it is so slow i got a micron i bought the computer from micron and my motherboard sound card video card all of my network cards the case the only thing anymore that is original is the hard drive the cdrom the 35 the 128mb ram chip and the cpu it is the only thing that is factory anymore no they probably would not so what are your plans for the future going business for yourself contact with a day trading firm down in west virginia and they are starting an intern program sometime i do not even know when but if that opens up i will probably seriously consider going down to west virginia they are in richmond west virginia richmond i have been saying west virginia have not i they are in virginia sorry their home base is in richmond virginia is there a richmond in virginia okay their home base is in richmond virginia is there a richmond in virginia okay their home base is in richmond virginia and if they open up the intern program like i am hoping they will then i will go down there and join the intern program because i would love to learn how to day trade i have always been good with stocks i have always been good with them but where am i going in the future i do not know i know eventually i am going to go back to law school and get a law interesting would you be interested in trial stuff i do not know trial stuff i also would not mind doing since i will have a business degree i would not mind doing some sort of financial laws stuff like being a lawyer for somebody who wants to sue the crap out of another corporation oh plenty of money in that i do not want to be an ambulance chaser i just want to be somebody who helps screw all the big giants one giant wants to beat the crap out of the other giant 

Recording: (3491/ 9621) 
but that is what they go through 

Recording: (3492/ 9621) 
well i did not necessarily want to but that is where my family started me out they are alternative to the public schools supposedly just more i do not know exactly how to explain it the only thing that i know is that i never learned to do anything 

Recording: (3493/ 9621) 
not to sound like a broken record but i really think it is our backslide on family units i think it is too easy to stay and i have been married and divorced so i have unfortunately had that experience to me that it is too easy to get divorced people do not really go into marriage with commitment and lifetime and have that i do not want to say oldfashioned values but just the value of this is very important because let us face it to me love is a choice because there is times when i do not love my husband i want to smack him and he is being a little barney but i choose to be in love with him because i made that choice and then that passes and lo and behold an hour later a week later whatever it takes i am in love with him again i mean really you know what i am saying and i think it is just too easy to get divorced i do not believe in staying in a marriage for the sake of the children but i think if you really make that commitment and actually work on it you can have a great relationship you can have kids and bring them up in a more stable environment unfortunately i think that is the problem parents are a either getting divorced and then they get caught up in their petty little things and start pitting the kids against each other you know using the kid as a medium or they are too selfish and do not listen to their kids or they did not i do not want to say selfish but let us face it like we said you know even having a dog take some time out of your schedule and not spending enough time with the kids they are working whatnot and it takes a lot of effort to raise kids these days and actually listen to them and get to know them and let them grow and things like that and i do not think enough families are doing that 

Recording: (3494/ 9621) 
no i do not work for politics 

Recording: (3495/ 9621) 
so i gave myself a long weekend yeah it is i wish i would been last weekend it was real nice last weekend so i gave myself a long weekend and just catch up sleep a little bit run around my daughter is getting ready to go to italy so that is

they try to limit the 

Recording: (3498/ 9621) 
money is not everything it is too bad sports have ended up this way 

Recording: (3499/ 9621) 
or on your hard drive because this really for all the world looks to me just like a rough draft or i will say to my students have your mom look it over have your sister look it over have somebody else proofread it because you are not going to see the mistakes because you are too busy thinking about the content of what you wanted to say and you are not going to notice them spelled thim or they thay yeah or a sentence that is too long or a sentence that is a fragment and it is not a complete thought you are not going to notice that because you know what it was supposed to say so give it to a friend or somebody and let them just on your rough copy just let them circle anything they do not understand and that will really help you oh well i had a 

Recording: (3500/ 9621) 
yeah i guess so i mean people spend hours on computers doing this type of thing let is go down there and see what they can find 

Recording: (3501/ 9621)

Recording: (3509/ 9621) 
we now run under gregorian and that sort of thing but back to your question i think you were asking 

Recording: (3510/ 9621) 
well in the lower grades i believe that they are because i think they should have some male role models 

Recording: (3511/ 9621) 
that goes with the disorder they know who is button to push and when not to push a button and how far they can go and where the line is and they push you always that is why teachers they drive the teacher up the wall 

Recording: (3512/ 9621) 
mmhmm

Recording: (3521/ 9621) 
and i have kids that say i do better when i listen to my music honest i do mrs m please let me listen to my headphones but then they can not hear you when you say ok the time is up stop now or whatever you are going hey poke him so i do not usually let the kids listen to their headphones maybe the last week of school in june or something or maybe right around christmas time but most of the time i do not because i get too out of touch with everything that is going on in the room i do not have a regular size class i will have five six seven kids at a time believe me when you have got seven hyperactive 

Recording: (3522/ 9621) 
after i had asked about coming to this city with all this thousand people and they are all different every year they are all different people and that did not happen back home i keep meeting people and it is just really fascinating yeah it is this endless flow of people and you are like wow and man there are some good looking people down here man there is some good looking chicks down here in columbus let me tell you yeah my freshman year i went out with any of them the opposite of charismatic is the serious oldtime protestant church where they put numbers up on the wall and you open up your hymnal to those numbers you sing you stand up when everyone tells you to stand up you sit down when everyone tells you to sit down yada yada and then the protestant sorry the charismatic is the exact opposite of that when you think of charismatic you think of the black churches where there is all sorts of organ playing and praise the lord and hands in the air and singing and dancing and people falling over and she really introduced me to that and then we dated for about three months and i both of us decided okay this is we accomplished what we were supposed to accomplish in this relationship you have introduced me to something and i have introduced you to something and now we are gonna go our separate ways and so we separated and then i found my current church and got plugged in there and i met someone there in january of this year we dated for two months and then i got really tired of the fact that within two weeks of knowing me and dating me she said oh william you are the person i am gonna marry and that 

Recording: (3523/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3524/ 9621) 
in his own mind regardless it is part of that bad spirit that people have created not the devil not satan to the native people he does not exist and to me he does not exist he is a piece of shit but he is real 

Recording: (3525/ 9621) 
and she would not have learned that a whole day kindergarten here 

Recording: (3526/ 9621)

Recording: (3527/ 9621) 
these editors are so paranoid you know what i mean they are more worried about stopping 

Recording: (3528/ 9621) 
we wanted it to keep on going but they just did not need to do like that and then i think once they noticed that the commons were going to open without them they realized that the university is functioning or was functioning fine without them 

Recording: (3529/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (3530/ 9621) 
more like that right 

Recording: (3531/ 9621) 
reality strikes 

Recording: (3532/ 9621) 
what is called high school 

Recording: (3533/ 9621) 
it makes me wonder because i do not see a lot of movies so a lot of this is just from reading reviews and stuff but it seems like last year two explosions would do the job this year you have got to have five explosions and two car chases and mutilated bodies it just seems like you need more and more sensationalism to sell your product and it is scary it is really hard to do to talk about morals without bringing religious background or something into it i think i think the way the schools should approach it is that if you get pregnant it is going to ruin your life so you do not want to do that do you that sort of thing 

Recording: (3534/ 9621) 
so i mean it is something i am comfortable with 

Recording: (3535/ 9621) 
now 

Recording: (3536/ 9621) 
now what kind of impression is her kids getting 

Recording: (3537/ 9621)

Recording: (3548/ 9621) 
well we were in north africa first for the north african campaign when romel was still roaming and then that ended up in the summer of apollo 1942 i believe and then we were sent to italy i was in a field artillery outfit sixinch guns 

Recording: (3549/ 9621) 
every stage of parenth wonder what causes that it seems pretty random your parents knew of your parents and i walk to my friend is house and half her friends if she is going over to play they got to drive them almost because they are all around so it is not the neighborhood thing as much and you can not let them run around as much as we did we rode our bikes everywhere we rode to the pool we rode down to the store and now you are scared to let them ride around anywhere because you are afraid they are not going to come back so yeah it is so many different things so what was it like being in the military oh it was not bad i enjoyed it a lot oh yeah i watched the first open heart transplant i saw the first liver transplant 

Recording: (3550/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3551/ 9621)

Recording: (3552/ 9621) 
just my wife and i this time 

Recording: (3553/ 9621) 
just how like to there is no real like everybody conforms to their own set of norms in each group you know it is like people no matter like you know even if ted kaczynski is out like on you know wherever and like his little shed you know he is still a part of society like how you can not get away from society and just how like how society develops in general like how high school is like is is kind of true to to life but then really different too on how life is it is just more of a closeknit thing so it is more apparent how segregation works or whatever 

Recording: (3554/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (3555/ 9621) 
cool 

Recording: (3556/ 9621) 
what are they expecting she is worked you know really hard and my son he is a senior he is 22 he is a senior here i do not think he is going to graduate in 2000 because he is a new senior he wants to go to law school he does a real law school he is like an honor honor honor everything you know but that is all you know on him he did it you know 

Recording: (3557/ 9621) 
so that to me is very like that is ridiculous like the governor he could have made a stay or you know what i mean and they have openly admitted that they have killed people that were found to be innocent later 

Recording: (3558/ 9621) 
so i do not know 

Recording: (3559/ 9621) 
and the state of ohio is definition of gifted child is anyone who scores 70 or higher on some test that they give well they have seen half the students in columbus schools are gifted students it is impossible gifted students there is 14 different characteristics to look at you can not just look at one thing 

Recording: (3560/ 9621) 
well in some ways i guess it is necessary but it is just reminiscent about the way it used to look and i was just at a place last night i was at this public comment meeting for the little darby national wildlife refuge that they are planning for madison county and there were some talk about that and it seemed to me there were people that were in favor of the refuge and there were people that were opposed to the wildlife refuge mostly people that lived there near their farmers but it seemed like the one thing that almost everybody there agreed on was they did not want to see the place go to be overrun by condos and housing developments and that we somebody was talking there about the difference between development here in the united states and in europe and how development in europe tends to take note of the fact that space is not limitless so you will have more people living in one house or one apartment building and they will go up rather than across just to take up space and you know they are conscientious about preserving space and preserving wild space 

Recording: (3561/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (3562/ 9621)

Recording: (3567/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (3568/ 9621)

Recording: (3569/ 9621)

Recording: (3571/ 9621)

Recording: (3572/ 9621)

two for country one for state or province 

Recording: (3598/ 9621) 
right well kind of like just because everybody else is doing it this way does not mean it is the right way and yeah you know i really struggle with that because i come more from i think the family should teach it but let us be realistic how many families are gonna do that or have the mentality to do that it seems like i sound like my dad but it seems like these days most of the people a lot of people that are having kids should not be 

Recording: (3599/ 9621)

yeah you just set the computer and key the data in or well the system we are doing now is you can put in the address the url for a web resource and it goes out and extracts data analyzes what is there and comes up with subject terminology and call numbers and presents it back to you and then you can edit and do whatever you want with it so it is doing some of that some of that the automatic assigning of subject headings and call numbers we are doing a lot of research on that it is got a ways to go it is getting better 

Recording: (3623/ 9621) 
i do not think that really matters honestly i mean it is i mean by the time you get into the boy scouts you are usually 8th grade or something like that 7th 8th grade and up and i think by that time most kids have at least a general idea of who they are and what they like and do not like i can not see i can not see them actually looking at like their leader or whatever as being too much of a role model figure anymore obviously it should be someone they respect but i can not say that they would be like oh well he does it so i am going to have to do it too or whatever 

Recording: (3624/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (3625/ 9621) 
i had always maintained that back in the day darth vader was a tragic hero of the star wars thing it was not about the innocence of luke skywalker and rebellion

Recording: (3631/ 9621) 
death of protection 

Recording: (3632/ 9621) 
does not that get back more or less to the thing about everybody being me me me now and therefore they really do not so much care about where they came from and what they are and who they are 

Recording: (3633/ 9621) 
or you know the things that we learned when we were kids because our mom taught them or we learned them at church in a game or something they all look at you like christopher robin who is that piglet who is that you know there is a whole generation of kids now whose moms did not stay home and read to them and all that fairy tale stuff and nursery rhyme stuff they do not have a clue what you are talking about 

Recording: (3634/ 9621) 
well i think they got that all off of the tv i mean that influenced 

Recording: (3635/ 9621) 
right at the age that they were 

Recording: (3636/ 9621) 
she said well you have to take a foreign language i said look i am not taking any more foreign languages we are going to figure out how to avoid this no you have to take a foreign i said look lady there are 60000 students in this university and if you think that i am going to believe for a second that they all take foreign language classes after having seen the college of foreign language you are insane there is another way to do this experience what is it well you have to take a foreign language i said ok we are going to change the question a little bit here you have two options now tell me how to avoid taking a foreign language or tell me how to talk to somebody who is not you because that is apparently all i have gotten available she said well you have to take i said how do i talk to somebody else she said well you have to talk to me as long as you are in this college i was like where is the form 

Recording: (3637/ 9621) 
you are from where 

Recording: (3638/ 9621) 
i am not sure that the federal government has the ability to convince enough people to do it and i do not think it is i think the people that are going to be ready to accept it and go with it are i do not think you are going to get a good cross section of the population i think the people will be willing to understand it and go with it more they are going to be the more educated and that sort of thing then you are leaving out a larger part of the population so i am not sure it is going to give valid results anyway 

Recording: (3639/ 9621) 
yeah yeah exactly the last three outs everyone is like yeah let us hope he does it but until then you are like ok this is ridiculous 

Recording: (3640/ 9621)

Recording: (3644/ 9621)

yeah like have someone come and tell them you have this much time or i would not recommend you stay on this program this long and i know there is programs that if you get on it and they pay you you have to pay that money back after you get on your feet well i mean i think someone should be able to come out and tell you about these things and let you know what you can and have to do to do this 

Recording: (3666/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (3667/ 9621)

well one of the things i am doing is i am applying for a number of research grants to go to germany and continue my research so hopefully i will get one of those i think i am in pretty good shape to get one of those so that might cause me to put off grad school for a year but i do not think the grad schools will mind if i 

Recording: (3683/ 9621) 
from our friends that have gone yeah their discipline is expelling the child from school well they are expelling them to a home where the parent is working where they are just getting three days of free play i mean pretty much to get in trouble and cause more trouble they really are not learning from that 

Recording: (3684/ 9621) 
staggered backbeats and stuff so i can play bass and i have a processor thing and stuff that i fool around with just doing stuff like that some of my friends play on drum machines and stuff like that so i just do stuff like that more like it is not like you are playing you are not spinning records it is like making 

Recording: (3685/ 9621) 
it is like each neighborhood is got a little different personality 

Recording: (3686/ 9621) 
yeah i have been a fan forever pretty much i did not really have any other teams 

Recording: (3687/ 9621) 
subjective right 

Recording: (3688/ 9621) 
yeah just ridiculous amounts of stuff i am like i do not want to do that 

Recording: (3689/ 9621) 
serious illness that needs to be helped not just you know well stick them in a place where they can just concentrate on it even more so we have got a long ways to go there 

Recording: (3690/ 9621) 
mhm 

Recording: (3691/ 9621) 
i did have a job like that when i worked full time 

Recording: (3692/ 9621) 
am i dressing crazy 

Recording: (3693/ 9621) 
because it is hard for us to deal with 

Recording: (3694/ 9621) 
yeah and i can say there are some drugs that i do not really consider to be too threatening or that i am really too worried about people using like i mean just the whole idea with marijuana things like that i mean it does not really bother me so much i mean cigarettes and alcohol basically do the same thing it does 

Recording: (3695/ 9621) 
ha ha ha 

Recording: (3696/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (3697/ 9621) 
take that away 

Recording: (3698/ 9621) 
exactly 

Recording: (3699/ 9621) 
i mean my middle brother was always around he was not very social in high school 

Recording: (3700/ 9621) 
i told him that he gets no guarantee that i will come back and in exchange i do not get health coverage while i am gone that seems perfectly reasonable to me and i go okay super 

Recording: (3701/ 9621) 
and so i think i will probably end up changing i do not know what to it would probably be more towards the education line 

Recording: (3702/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3703/ 9621) 
whether it is a written goal or not that is what they are doing 

Recording: (3704/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3705/ 9621) 
and 

Recording: (3706/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (3707/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (3708/ 9621) 
or board games or just anything that happens to appeal 

Recording: (3709/ 9621) 
because i thought you know basically the city is been ran pretty well basically you know as far as cities are 

Recording: (3710/ 9621) 
yeah where are they needed right 

Recording: (3711/ 9621)

Recording: (3714/ 9621) 
that 

Recording: (3715/ 9621) 
i do not know i guess that is one way to get you into the business but i do not know how do you prepare yourself for teaching in front of a large audience that is something i would have to anyways ease myself into 

Recording: (3716/ 9621) 
i do not know just exactly where the others are but they are here in the columbus area 

Recording: (3717/ 9621)

Recording: (3724/ 9621) 
or sustaining heat when heated by a fire 

Recording: (3725/ 9621)

Recording: (3727/ 9621) 
i knew we would not go into this city where all these terrible things are dance clubs drugs homosexuality and you are going to go the other direction you are going to lose your faith but it christians and before i left for college my freshman year my dad my dad knows me real well mainly because i am doing almost a mirror image of what he did when he grew up aside from the faith that i have i am very much like him he wrote out a list of seven things seven predictions for william is freshman year and every single one of them was accurate it was really really really funny william will lose something expensive by the end of the year and i had my bike stolen great direction and i knew one way or the other what happened because i am the type i mean my roommate my freshman year for the first quarter was a drug dealer oh yeah it was real fun real fun i discreetly got him kicked out of the dorm he still does not know it was me but yeah he still does not know it was me but he and i are still on speaking terms which is fascinating but you know i mean our first day i walked in he said hey i am tom you ever smoke pot before i was like no he said hey we got a whole year together and i am directly quoting that is the first thing he said to me that is the first thing he said to me no no he is not but he and i hung out a lot and i knew that one of the things was gonna happen i was gonna follow him and start doing all sorts of interesting and wrong things within my own mind every time i would have done them i would have known they were wrong or i was going to the opposite direction and i went the opposite direction i got plugged in with some christian groups on campus made some christian friends and hung out with them and grew a lot grew a lot in acceptance of other people i mean you do not really run into homosexuals in a small rural christian community and if you do you do not know it because they will get shunned out of the community so fast that it is crazy but where was i going with that okay 

Recording: (3728/ 9621)

Recording: (3761/ 9621) 
well westerville yeah so that is difficult for us to deal with 

Recording: (3762/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (3763/ 9621) 
that is where we are in our evolution on this one 

Recording: (3764/ 9621) 
well definitely it just happened to me when i was in the third grade two of our friends went home after school and we were playing with a gun and everything and one of them shot and killed the other one you know accidentally it just goes to you know my dad always had the gun he did not have it locked up all the time but it was not necessarily in the same place all the time either so if you were not really looking for it you would have to just happenstance onto it or something i believe nowadays that perhaps with the guns the availability and more people having guns that should not have them apparently you know they should be under lock and key and as for the parents somebody is responsible for it you know but see then you get into catch22 because of the legislation i mean you can not require i do not see how you can require a guy who buys a gun to buy a lock and then buy a safe for the gun and do all that stuff because that in the case of a burglar comes into your house which is why you have a gun anyway you have some fear of something like that happening otherwise you should not have one unless you are a sportsman then you know it is not gonna be worth it to have the gun in the first place 

Recording: (3765/ 9621) 
so i pretty much it is not stressful at all it is really easy it is not challenging 

Recording: (3766/ 9621) 
yeah he is yeah he is 26 

Recording: (3767/ 9621) 
probably it is you are right i asked him what language did he have to learn to get it 

Recording: (3768/ 9621) 
i have a great employer and i got hired in one of the opening lines in the interview conversation is hi i am and in this particular month i am going to europe and i may or may not come back you want to continue talking he said sure let is keep talking i said okay and then we continue talking so it is up in the air 

Recording: (3769/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3770/ 9621) 
and he was always like really red faced and the kids would say you know he went out at lunch and got drunk and came back and that was one of the better schools in columbus and you know i just saw a lot of that i just saw a lot of principals driving big fabulous cars 

Recording: (3771/ 9621) 
by the time being since nanny which the prochip killed and uh you 

Recording: (3772/ 9621) 
and it is really unfortunate for the good workers in there and the people at mirror lake are so great 

Recording: (3773/ 9621) 
i teach a class on thursday nights how to play with computers i play games on tuesday nights 

Recording: (3774/ 9621)

Recording: (3776/ 9621) 
oh yes i did vote 

Recording: (3777/ 9621) 
and i do not know i think having the word honors gives some kids enough prestige that they do not totally freak out about not going ivy league 

Recording: (3778/ 9621) 
boy i do not know i am thinking you know of the divorced people i know who have had children involved and boy it always seems to me by the time they get to that step it is already you know they have already been to counseling they have already tried a lot of other things and that they are i do not know whether some kind of courtordered thinking about it heavy thinking would 

Recording: (3779/ 9621) 
that is true books reading well i think it is normal to read books and stuff but you are sitting there or you are reading a magazine did you know what this guy did look down at him did you see what this guy did 

Recording: (3780/ 9621) 
and it is really sort of interesting 

Recording: (3781/ 9621) 
yeah but i mean that is civilizationwide 

Recording: (3782/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (3783/ 9621) 
and eventually he was all right with it he got used to it 

Recording: (3784/ 9621) 
a lot of them they do not want any better they do not want anything different that is all they want 

Recording: (3785/ 9621) 
but you know i knew that they had already made that promise and there is a lot of businesses that could move out of that area you know and half of those taxes come to columbus even if a business is in westerville half the tax the employees tax are going to westerville and half are coming to columbus 

Recording: (3786/ 9621) 
gun locks were easy to pick you can break into anything but when i was a kid too we used to go out to turkey shoots and i would go hunting all the time so i was pretty familiar with guns my kid he grew up he was familiar with guns but he also knew not to touch them 

Recording: (3787/ 9621) 
yeah i do not well we just sort of started making a big splash in australia in about the last three years so they may have 

Recording: (3788/ 9621) 
i am trying to work on my license for skydiving now 

Recording: (3789/ 9621) 
that you would need like in the old days you know to melt metal they used air pumping it through 

Recording: (3790/ 9621) 
not yet i mean he will pull himself up on table and he will like turn around like hey 

Recording: (3791/ 9621) 
but yeah i hope to at 49 i have learned a heck of a lot a lot of things i would not want to know but i think they have been really good as long as you turn them around and make them a positive statement for you but that is why i would really like to have a bookstore just down around campus people can come in and go over there and relax you know and um-hum 

Recording: (3792/ 9621) 
well when i came back from oregon my father was very ill and so i did not want fulltime work and i started substituting out in licking county which paid terribly low there is all these little districts that have a superintendent well no they have two elementaries one middle school and one high school and a superintendent which they do not need you know so they hire straight out of college always and there is a law that you have to pay for your accumulated time so i could not get a job out there because i had about six years experience they had to pay me for so i came back into columbus and it is a lot harder to work in columbus public but i know the territory i know where i am going 

Recording: (3793/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (3794/ 9621) 
well basically it is the same thing here but some of your management is real good i have seen people that are super but i have seen people that are bad the problem is you get a bad management and it can make your life hell i do not care who you are 

Recording: (3795/ 9621) 
so he is learning about the computer now it is going to be kind of a hobby type thing at least it is not a work thing but i know we can do a lot of things for our house 

Recording: (3796/ 9621) 
and i hate hearing myself on tape too 

Recording: (3797/ 9621) 
i you know maybe i am oblivious to things but i mean it seems like there is a lot of worse places 

Recording: (3798/ 9621) 
i do not know if i could trust them you know 

Recording: (3799/ 9621) 
video 

Recording: (3800/ 9621)

Recording: (3802/ 9621) 
i could see that thing he would be ducking them you know 77 years old i can not imagine being hurt by him you know 

Recording: (3803/ 9621) 
yeah you can not say a noun is always going to be orange and it is going to be slippery you know i mean language is so much more abstract than math and science so the abstract areas like history and english and reading and literature that is where these kids have their problems because their disability is usually rooted in somewhere in the languages they either can not write can not read can not spell can not do all three or are not very good at any of them once in a while you will see a good speller because he can remember the order in which the letters come but he might be a horrible reader and a horrible writer even though he can spell yeah and his comprehension of the words of other kids his age would not be what it should be generally speaking my kids are two to four years behind 

Recording: (3804/ 9621) 
it is 

Recording: (3805/ 9621) 
i did not really start out as a teacher i started out as a speech and hearing therapist but they kept giving me these kids that i could not keep them in the chair long enough to do the speech therapy with them so i got interested in the hyperactivity and so i started taking classes about kids with adhd and stuff and little by little for co i had my master is in learning disabilities it was mostly just so i could learn how to keep the kids in their seat long enough to do the speech therapy then when i found out there were so many openings in special ed so and then i found out later that speech therapy is a very good background for ld because a lot of these ld kids have language deficits and language problems they can not you know like express themselves on paper or they do not process things correctly auditorily so that is the perfect background to work with ld kids i did not know i was doing that at the time 

Recording: (3806/ 9621) 
sure well that and they like tuesday when we were blessed with the turn of events of weather there she came in and i did i was reading a book and i let her out and i let her back in and i started reading again and i am looking around and here is mud so it is kind of good in a way because it kind of well you know you live here it is not that big of a deal you know because i know my sister would freak 

Recording: (3807/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (3808/ 9621) 
well it was just communication was not there 

Recording: (3809/ 9621) 
well i think it is more capable of being violent because of the information available to people about bombs and stuff like that you know or before you know somebody get mad at somebody you know you might they might shoot them or something but not kill 100 innocent people for no reason 

Recording: (3810/ 9621) 
to abbe house 

Recording: (3811/ 9621) 
you know like you know typical american tourist 

Recording: (3812/ 9621) 
yeah i love that show i have nearly every episode on tape but this past season i have been really disappointed with the simpsons 

Recording: (3813/ 9621) 
which is not fun and number two you know the diseases and things like that i think that is a good idea to teach just that it is not all fun and peer pressured stuff i know i kind of got off track there but 

Recording: (3814/ 9621) 
hehe 

Recording: (3815/ 9621)

Recording: (3827/ 9621) 
his mom even signed for stuff i think 

Recording: (3828/ 9621) 
you know just always just active and he is always been very active in sports but when i put him on the riddle and he was laying on the couch you know just zombie doubt 

Recording: (3829/ 9621) 
to make money on the side all through the government that is what i mean it is too easy to get away with stuff nowadays 

Recording: (3830/ 9621) 
i think they should too i do i really do and you are right that is not fair because then that is a waste 

Recording: (3831/ 9621) 
i do not know do you know anything about unix 

Recording: (3832/ 9621) 
you could call the operations over there and say is this airplane on the ground 

Recording: (3833/ 9621) 
and they set the ammunition on fire they just shot our gun position up pretty good and that night finally they well i do not know exactly how we got a hold of back to our headquarters but anyway we did so they sent the prime movers the trucks which we moved the guns with out and we hitched what was remaining of the guns on them and went back wondering now they gonna put us in infantry or something we do not have any artillery guns but i do not know what it was but a couple or three days they had more guns i mean more artillery pieces up there for us to use and then one other time after in italy or when we were in italy they moved us into a position that we should have never been in we were you know let us say we come around a mountain like there is a mountain here 

Recording: (3834/ 9621) 
hehe 

Recording: (3835/ 9621)

i am looking for a parttime job as we speak i have been like doing temporary on and off the thing with that is you can work you know for four or five months and then nothing and then like that so right now i am looking for something permanent 

Recording: (3840/ 9621) 
so i think 

Recording: (3841/ 9621) 
her little boyfriend who was the captain kirk commander riker stud persona i see in many ways i mean i agree in deep space nine i am a big deep space nine fan it is like i do not dislike voyager i just do not like it to the same degree in deep space nine they had major kira who was a soldier and a revolutionary and i thought in many ways she completely broke out of traditional gender roles i also like deep space nine in that they address the issue of different people living and working together different people of different i mean these were aliens rather than different ethnic denominations of humans but it approached that from a less from a more realistic standpoint instead of having like an old star trek everyone gets along then we come to people who do not get along and we look at the problems it was centered on that i am getting off topic i wanted to go back to voyager what you were saying with the generals i liked at first having captain janeway being a female in the leadership standpoint but i still think that the women on the show particularly seven of nine are used as sex objects for the viewers 

Recording: (3842/ 9621) 
oh were they they were already in the garage did they not buy them themselves 

Recording: (3843/ 9621)

you 

Recording: (3849/ 9621) 
sometimes it is even easier to understand them because they enunciate so well but that is something we have never understood if we can fake that accent 

Recording: (3850/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (3851/ 9621) 
a while 

Recording: (3852/ 9621) 
i know i know but you know there is three of the family three of the children have children and they each have two and each one the girl is the oldest and then the boy the second and that is good though and i hope and i know my son who is not married right now he is 31 i know that he wants children very badly so i should probably end up with about 8 or 10 i would imagine so 

Recording: (3853/ 9621) 
i know yeah i know it is ridiculous i am just i find that just crazy 

Recording: (3854/ 9621) 
so do kangaroos actually bounce or is that just you know

yeah things that are like simple chord changes and you can just fool around with on them and stuff 

Recording: (3860/ 9621)

are 

Recording: (3862/ 9621) 
little bit 

Recording: (3863/ 9621) 
fire hazards 

Recording: (3864/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3865/ 9621)

Recording: (3867/ 9621) 
yes i did 

Recording: (3868/ 9621)

yeah i did telemarketing for a while but that is terrible people yeah i got tired of people yelling at me like you interrupted my dinner and blah blah blah but it was okay because the place i worked at did not monitor our calls so you could just yell at them and you would just be like i do not care 

Recording: (3874/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3875/ 9621) 
well there is plenty of stuff yeah well it is not like sex it is a little bit safer but it is kind of just go out with your equipment and if you catch one you catch one if you do not then you do not but i have caught plenty of dinners lunch breakfast all that

Recording: (3900/ 9621) 
just travel to australia maybe you hear these stories you ever go to europe you ever do the backpacking bit 

Recording: (3901/ 9621)

Recording: (3935/ 9621) 
it was a really long time ago everything is fine but i guess for me i do not know it was just a little more than i wanted to see but the classes i think were helpful but would you ask me 

Recording: (3936/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (3937/ 9621) 
oh yeah i have been there 20 over 20 years so yeah i am enjoying it it is always changing 

Recording: (3938/ 9621) 
see i live close to a 

Recording: (3939/ 9621) 
i am sure the fact that my parents my mother tries really hard but my father was an alcoholic he was a working alcoholic so that he insisted he could drink on the weekends and never miss work et cetera yeah there was no problem but the biggest problem is the fact that he and i i have always expected to have some sort of a respect from them and because they always wanted me to grow up and be independent and think for myself and so i am exactly what they always said they wanted it is just that they can not handle that and so when i was in seventh grade and i got in a lot of trouble about the whole racial thing because i am from a school where i was mostly white students were 

Recording: (3940/ 9621) 
but you can make them aware if somebody as an adult steps over that line or makes them uncomfortable there should be some kind of a system to where these girls the slightest bit it is anonymous it is you know 

Recording: (3941/ 9621) 
yeah my brother did not know what the heck to do with a checkbook 

Recording: (3942/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (3943/ 9621) 
mmhmm we actually were from columbus and we moved down to athens and they moved back up here when i was in the service air force i was in 6972 so then i was in two years reserves basically an electronic engineer not an engineer but an electronic assembly and stuff like that a missile systems analyst is what it was called but they have got these big names for things 

Recording: (3944/ 9621) 
to tell you the truth the school i went to sucked 

Recording: (3945/ 9621) 
would be interested in i mean not just for the kids sake but would be interested on their own behalf in teaching the child what 

Recording: (3946/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (3947/ 9621) 
어 

Recording: (3948/ 9621) 
she was but i admired her more because until the moderates get control of the republican party again that is gonna be the litmus test it was just like back in the 60s and the 70s when the extreme left wing had control of the democratic party they would nominate such people as mcgovern who i voted for but had no chance of winning over the years i have moderated my hardline left of center liberal stance for more of a moderate middle of the road because it is easier to get that sold to the american public so while i think dole was correct i think yeah she shot herself in the foot she would have never gotten the nomination as long as the party remains the way that it is being controlled by the extreme right wing which is a problem for the republicans they need to move towards the middle which i think george w is trying to do whenever anybody tells me that i tell them yes and i am an indifferent liberal 

Recording: (3949/ 9621) 
and they have met the couple that is going to adopt the baby which seems kind of odd to me 

Recording: (3950/ 9621) 
he has not for about four years he refuses to live with us because we have rules 

Recording: (3951/ 9621) 
i keep thinking about that all the time but i am like i want something where i can be off during the summer so i can take my kids and we can go out west or you know because my wife is in the same boat she will retire two years after i do and our kids you know will be young i am a fiveyearold and i only have six years to go so we are talking 11 years old 

Recording: (3952/ 9621)

Recording: (3954/ 9621) 
i have heard it it has not been as i have heard it from less reputable sources 

Recording: (3955/ 9621) 
okay i am thinking people who backpack are pretty cool 

Recording: (3956/ 9621) 
i do not think forcing prayer on somebody if they do not believe in it i do not think that is the right thing to do 

Recording: (3957/ 9621) 
no because they are going to learn that on their own i personally think that it is a choice i do not think you are born that way because i have friends that are homosexual and i do not believe in what they are doing but i do not do everything right every day so i still love them and they are my friends and blah blah blah but i have also known people that were that way and now are heterosexual and are much happier and they realize that it was just a choice they made and things like that so it is in today is day and age they are going to learn about it quickly 

Recording: (3958/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (3959/ 9621) 
mm hmm that is a bunch of that is just one of those myths i think that is to make people feel guilty or something 

Recording: (3960/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3961/ 9621) 
yeah well i think it would be good if it expanded out a little bit more i mean it is smaller compared to most downtowns i mean you know it seems like you just drive through in two minutes and you are out so i do not think that would hurt anything and then to live there if they made it more affordable that would be nice so 

Recording: (3962/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3963/ 9621) 
biology experience

Recording: (3972/ 9621) 
it is it was very much high school 

Recording: (3973/ 9621) 
but right now with his attitude the way it is i would say that me and my family are better off not having him stirring up a bunch of conflict or whatever 

Recording: (3974/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (3975/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (3976/ 9621) 
but go on 

Recording: (3977/ 9621) 
so there is always something going wrong with the wiring or the plumbing or the something it seemed like a good idea about 25 years ago to get a house an older house but no not anymore 

Recording: (3978/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3979/ 9621) 
they never saw it they never said anything about it 

Recording: (3980/ 9621) 
i do not know it just sounds like it would be something that i would have to have it is just necessary

mhm 

Recording: (3987/ 9621) 
a whole lot 

Recording: (3988/ 9621) 
because like i said it all came together because i do not understand how people can let their kids be hurt 

Recording: (3989/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3990/ 9621) 
what they should do is just tell people that their kids do not get to go to school i bet the attitude changes pretty fast 

Recording: (3991/ 9621) 
i do not know if there is any particular i think if someone knows if anyone knew of something like that going on they would 

Recording: (3992/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3993/ 9621) 
and i think if we could just keep that going into middle school 

Recording: (3994/ 9621) 
yeah i could skip any program i wanted to you know just show up at the parties basically

i hate to be in the predicament of having to change anything it would be hard to change for one group and not another 

Recording: (4002/ 9621) 
as opposed to what the catholic church actually thinks is correct 

Recording: (4003/ 9621) 
yeah it can be a problem if you get hit 

Recording: (4004/ 9621) 
oh i think the society in general is declining in a lot of ways our morals are declining and our intelligence level maybe not level i mean iqs are still high but people are settling for less i have a big sign in my room that says never settle for less than your very best because i really think people are getting lazy even adults we do not even want to wait 25 seconds for microwave popcorn we are getting impatient 

Recording: (4005/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (4006/ 9621) 
oh is that right 

Recording: (4007/ 9621) 
probably northwest area 

Recording: (4008/ 9621) 
oh really i was like whoa milk and twizzlers 

Recording: (4009/ 9621) 
and some of them did and some of them were just complete idiots but you find that anywhere 

Recording: (4010/ 9621) 
the tail okay 

Recording: (4011/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (4012/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (4013/ 9621) 
the accents sometimes but they are okay no big problem but the accent sometimes it is like a sort of a running joke i do not know if i should say this but it is like if i can talk like this and talk all the time like this why is it that they can not talk like we do if i could talk that way because we do have pilots that do talk like 

Recording: (4014/ 9621) 
it is like let us go come on well yeah because i had lots of epidural because they induced me my doctor said hey it is time we can do this so i got it lucky even though i kind of wanted it to have it normal 

Recording: (4015/ 9621) 
all right 

Recording: (4016/ 9621) 
oh okay 

Recording: (4017/ 9621) 
issues so you know that is one thing that i hope that they work on 

Recording: (4018/ 9621) 
well it would have been something that they would have supported and something that i would have probably been pretty good at 

Recording: (4019/ 9621) 
hmm 

Recording: (4020/ 9621) 
what is bad about where i work at it is not so much racism as whereas if you are my supervisor i am just using this example and i do something wrong 

Recording: (4021/ 9621) 
she read my notes and all that 

Recording: (4022/ 9621) 
so i made a lot of stupid you know you look back and you see things you are like this is real obvious but at the time i think youth i was like a i can either change them or if they love me we can communicate and change things and you know that type of thing 

Recording: (4023/ 9621) 
and then you come here you know what i mean you see people stand out on street corners with signs work for food 

Recording: (4024/ 9621) 
oh yeah i think it is possible it would have to take the right combination of someone who can appeal to the party people and get the nomination and appeal to the people i think dole would have been a good candidate i would have been hard pressed some of her issues i do not like but when she came out and said her famous thing on the abortion issue when she came out against guns she went up a couple of notches in my estimation because i was not sure where she would be i thought she would have to sell herself as hardline with the hardline republicans and then i would not have been able to vote for her 

Recording: (4025/ 9621) 
and she is very determined she has said that being pregnant and having these babies made her focus on things a lot differently she does not want to go back to being the way she was before she does not want to go back to the drugs and the smoking and the drinking 

Recording: (4026/ 9621) 
great guy but he sure liked to get drunk you know and the problem was he would turn into such a jerk 

Recording: (4027/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4028/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (4029/ 9621) 
right right yeah yeah 

Recording: (4030/ 9621) 
yeah being a nurse the wife that helps a lot because that is what that thing was really functioning around was nurses getting them some good daycare because they work all these wild shifts and stuff so that is how it first started before it was not even on campus it was over on like 4th or summit in a church when it first started but it is just not people were always saying i can not believe how much you pay for daycare and i am like but look what we are getting you know people take their kids to somebody is neighbor is house and the lady can be sitting them in front of the tv 

Recording: (4031/ 9621) 
then they were raised and they are but i told her i you know there is i will never be married if my man is gonna be cheating on me i will not marry him 

Recording: (4032/ 9621) 
and he just pretty much cut ties with all of his old friends we still see them a lot and we were close with their parents 

Recording: (4033/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4034/ 9621) 
oh i see well that would be a good way i would think 

Recording: (4035/ 9621) 
a whole lot more places to live it seems like everywhere i turn there is construction and you know you go down one road and then you wait a couple years if you do not go in that area and it is all changed it looks all different so and that is mainly like looking up bethel and 315 knorr things like that 

Recording: (4036/ 9621) 
yeah ok 

Recording: (4037/ 9621) 
get it from us 

Recording: (4038/ 9621) 
i defended my stepmother against the rest of my family immediately following my father is death because there was some bitterness between the rest of my family and my stepmother so my sister and i defended my stepmother against the rest of my family stepmother eventually shafted us and so stepmother is evil 

Recording: (4039/ 9621) 
right and then they wonder why you know i do not know what is happened it is the other person who is changed you know and if you start changing your behavior you can usually get the kinds of changes i always figure if you treat people the way that old golden rule thing if you give out what you want back you get it 

Recording: (4040/ 9621) 
i play lottery once in a while if i have a couple bucks on me and uh well football games we will not even start with that

Recording: (4064/ 9621) 
i do not know those kids are they lack something in their upbringing and i do not know what it is thank goodness none of my kids ever took that sort of attitude i would like to think that my wife and i set them a good example my wife was a very conscientious hardworking woman she established a secretarial business there at her home for several years and anything that went out of there was right i mean and she did quite a lot of typing for students over here graduate students 

Recording: (4065/ 9621) 
and then one day my two sisters older and i bernice and frances and i were outside playing and bernice i do not know whether it was bernice or me but one of us said well let us go down and wade in the lake

Recording: (4080/ 9621) 
hmm 

Recording: (4081/ 9621) 
the parents have so much responsibility but the kid has so much responsibility and then society has so much responsibility so you know what i mean basically all i have ever seen is well like these kids that get in the house they go to their house they find a gun and they want to hold the parents responsible yes and no on that if the parents had the gun in the house and they had the ammunition locked up say in the trunk of their car what if the kid brought the ammunition from somewhere else and picked the gun lock off the gun 

Recording: (4082/ 9621) 
or i got to drive you know further north there is not any like really good businesses right around where i live that is the only thing so i think they need to come in you know read you know get the downtown going when i was a kid i loved to go downtown 

Recording: (4083/ 9621) 
i am not afraid 

Recording: (4084/ 9621)

Recording: (4102/ 9621) 
i would either go back in languages or actually i am a psychology undergraduate so yeah 

Recording: (4103/ 9621) 
because like i think it is archie griffin that went to a really crummy school in columbus and to me no matter how bad of an area you live in and bad a school you think you are going to if you want to do it you can because really in columbus public schools if you have a learning disability or if you have problems reading or you have problems at home there is a psychologist or a tutor or something to help you and in like worthington and westerville dublin you know they do not have the money to throw away and like catholic schools they do not have the money to put on those programs so some of those people kind of get pushed aside and so you know as you can see i am staying in my soapbox here i do like columbus public schools but you know i hate when people say you know look at these test scores because it really does not reflect what is there because it is like saying all kids carry guns to school they do not you know the media says well what is there been like maybe five or six people who have taken guns to school and killed people what about the millions and millions of kids that go to school every day do their homework and you know do community service and stuff well it is just too boring we do not want to hear that stuff that irritates me 

Recording: (4104/ 9621) 
we did a lot of searching when we bought our house it is hard to find what you want in a house and get the school system to you get into arlington you get into grandview places like this or bexley and the price range we were in you were gonna have to dump 50000 into the houses just to get them up we had a list of what we wanted in a house and our house was only 17 years old when we bought it but it had everything we wanted fireplace full dry basement you know two and a half car garage you know all the stuff that we wanted when a lot of the older houses wet basements garage burned down you know the lots were packed so we live on a golf course and have a creek in the backyard and so is really yeah i do not yeah they play in the creek they do not play golf yet

clinton is position on it well he sort of backed down from what it was going to be and then just hoped that it would drop and i mean what you hear and read lately is that it really has not changed much but again that is i think part of that too is society is not ready at some level to accept that and gays in the military is one thing but then people are talking about gay marriages and 

Recording: (4111/ 9621) 
correct

and what they say that we have done to the language and everything else and you are not a typical american but you know and then the next hour and a half they just say how bad americans are and you kind of think well thanks for the exclusion but you still have been insulting me for an hour and a half 

Recording: (4116/ 9621) 
yeah well it is gotten a lot worse when i say a lot worse because you say you do not have kids i got a kid 23 years old and there was no place for him to play 

Recording: (4117/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (4118/ 9621) 
well it is not just in the schools it is in society i mean violence seems to be an answer to a lot of things it is hard to imagine that there is an easy fix or if there is a fix it is kind of frustrating because you can not point to one thing and say this is what needs to be fixed again it is pervasive i is like the i do not know if you heard about this in the news a woman two women were having an argument one of them set fire to the other one 

Recording: (4119/ 9621) 
did he really 

Recording: (4120/ 9621)

Recording: (4121/ 9621) 
he never said much about it except he told about one time when he was in a hospital up in japan after he was burned he said that he was in a ward with a bunch of other burn patients and he said that some of them him included were able to get up and walk around so theand i can see their philosophy the medics had the guys that could walk help wait on the guys that were bedbound and he washad been helping one guy that was pretty bad off this guy passed away did not make it and so they started to put on get on to do something else well some of the other guys i am through i am not working anymore with him he told him and it is why yes you are what are to do send me back over to vietnam but they sent him home but he was not a very enthusiastic soldier i do not think at any time and especially after he came home 

Recording: (4122/ 9621) 
and that was very stressful 

Recording: (4123/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4124/ 9621) 
and so shortly after he was healed enough to go back to work they were married 

Recording: (4125/ 9621)

Recording: (4153/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (4154/ 9621) 
okay fine and the family probably said okay we want your advancement we want your goodwill the problem is you ran into culture differences culture differences over here and so forth and then we became a little more promiscuous and so gee you know mom dad and so forth they do not know what is going on here in the west coast with us you know and so forth and they think everything is going okay because we did not have communication as frequent and then all of a sudden you find out and usually mom found out geez something does not sound right through the airways or through the writing something is mysterious going on here and you found out they are having difficulties well divorce became acceptable before it was a nono now it is acceptable and then you had the celebrities becoming more known oh hey we do not get married anymore no okay then we have the idea of doing away with cash gold metallic the metallic backing i think it was kennedy was the one that did that and said we will just print promissory notes and so now we keep credit we buy ourselves out of every dilemma in the world and saying well hey we will just pay you more we pay you more country then fine but every time they print more it makes the money in your investment less but hey who cares huh that is what they have 

Recording: (4155/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (4156/ 9621)

Recording: (4159/ 9621) 
i am not sure 

Recording: (4160/ 9621) 
ha ha ha ha 

Recording: (4161/ 9621) 
excuse me 

Recording: (4162/ 9621) 
i was like a rebel it was not really my cup of tea actually i had a pretty decent job i worked four and a half days a week basically in the electromechanical type of things remove and replace what they do a lot now with cars they put a thing on a machine and it says take that out try it and you put that in so in hindsight you know it was cool but i had i liked the long hair it was back in the 60s so you know 

Recording: (4163/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4164/ 9621) 
which i mean is not necessarily a bad thing but it is definitely something that is noticeable in there 

Recording: (4165/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4166/ 9621) 
i do not think that i would have them go to any i learned things like how to speak french how to set a dinner table how to throw a hot tub party that kind of stuff was a lot more focused than i mean i did not even i do not think anybody even taught me how to write in cursive other than my parents so i mean it was interesting i mean it was a lot more cultural kinds of things you do a lot of things with nature and that kind of stuff it was the the 70s too so i mean you have to look at the time what we are talking about but i feel like i do not see why i would not send them to public schools 

Recording: (4167/ 9621) 
do you 

Recording: (4168/ 9621) 
the public transit system i mean i know they are doing the best they can but i do not see how we are ever gonna get out of this without light rail and i am really bummed 

Recording: (4169/ 9621) 
yeah avoiding mistakes is pretty much what they need to do better decisions that help 

Recording: (4170/ 9621) 
the 

Recording: (4171/ 9621) 
hmm 

Recording: (4172/ 9621) 
if there were any germans in there i will bet they are scared 

Recording: (4173/ 9621) 
yeah yeah i do not see figure that out i think it is all fixed 

Recording: (4174/ 9621) 
from high school and i won in that original group of kids that i had never did pass them all but i guess he is not worried because he is going to work with his dad and his dad is business so he is going to be okay but he never did pass the reading and the writing he passed everything else but and the questions are not the same i mean there is several different forms every time they send out the test it is sealed in a box and nobody is allowed to open it but the principal and then he has to distribute it to the teachers and so the questions could change 

Recording: (4175/ 9621) 
do my billing and stuff microsoft money 

Recording: (4176/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4177/ 9621) 
well then i think she probably took her girlfriends out to the mall you know and partied a little bit with their mcdonald is and everything that is one thing i see about kids doing nowadays a lot too is socializing like at shopping malls and things of that nature 

Recording: (4178/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (4179/ 9621) 
yeah hoosier yeah so things pretty much in columbus public schools they do not actually sit down with you they automatically assume that once you get to this level you are ready for this level and you go on 

Recording: (4180/ 9621) 
yeah i had a cousin that went on she was in school for that and as you can tell i like to do office work 

Recording: (4181/ 9621) 
that is what i was actually thinking of where he takes the pictures on the corner 

Recording: (4182/ 9621) 
now and it was just taking her out of her you know where she you know you grow up hearing those lies and 

Recording: (4183/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (4184/ 9621) 
how appalling oh yeah yeah my my family my mom especially is just like when are you going to stop doing that yeah because he is 16 months now and i think he is tapering off quite a bit so i think that he will be done soon but i am not pushing him so 

Recording: (4185/ 9621) 
you should you should be organized i am not i have this stack of like groceries maybe about a foot high sitting next to my bed i just remember when i went out and bought groceries and then the commons opened again 

Recording: (4186/ 9621) 
i mean you just never know how freaky 

Recording: (4187/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4188/ 9621) 
i am sure yeah i mean he does not throw women in her face no women call the house or anything you never know what she does not you know question him about where he is been or anything like that she just i just can not believe that i just think that is terrible 

Recording: (4189/ 9621) 
oh that is it 

Recording: (4190/ 9621) 
and it is it is it is kind of an oasis in the middle of the city 

Recording: (4191/ 9621) 
yeah not me it is too expensive 

Recording: (4192/ 9621) 
it is more feasible than a sixyearold 

Recording: (4193/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4194/ 9621) 
yeah exactly so you know once you get to a certain degree of frustration you need to relieve that somehow so that is pretty much why we moved 

Recording: (4195/ 9621) 
i have always thought that it ends up being a personal decision 

Recording: (4196/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4197/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4198/ 9621) 
mhm 

Recording: (4199/ 9621) 
and they see the same thing smeared back to them because we are making christ is images and we can not say no to him that is what heaven is like that is what we should go to bed at night thinking what did we do positive today and build on the positive it may have been the smallest part of that sheet of paper 

Recording: (4200/ 9621) 
but she was never interested in boys or in sports in high school or makeup and clothes and things like that you are setting yourself up for ridicule in high school for that and that is what happened she would come home in tears because kids made fun of her and stuff and finally she just stopped going and within a couple of months she got her ged 

Recording: (4201/ 9621) 
how old were you there and so what do you stop i was going through divorce parents both parents passed away my ex moved to st louis and did not tell me anything about her foreclosure on the house and that is how i found out she moved and just a bunch of shit i just started screwing up so they wanted to put me on probation and my rebellious attitude or whatever said i quit that is pretty stupid really 

Recording: (4202/ 9621) 
now 

Recording: (4203/ 9621) 
yeah they are really good about that 

Recording: (4204/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (4205/ 9621) 
those were the good old days that is a good day that is when you used to own them too you could trade them that is when we lost our rights there is some things that are traditional there capital t and some are low t low case t and you are talking about low case t i am talking about capital t 

Recording: (4206/ 9621) 
bye 

Recording: (4207/ 9621) 
i was going then relate to a comment that she made about i believe in the electric chair i believe in capital punishment but that was one comment she was talking about but then on the very very opposite extreme extreme opposite we talk about the love of the child from the day of birth and this may seem to be contradictory and i am not quite sure how to address that because some people would say now wait a minute you are talking out of both sides of your mouth the expression is how can you say over here you must have the love of this child in your arms arms and then over here you are saying you believe in capital punishment and electrocution 

Recording: (4208/ 9621) 
i think example is probably the best they see that you care and they learn to care i think my son john he is the youngest i think he is a very compassionate soul a very spiritual young man more so than his brother is and i always have tapped away that you know they say that sometimes you give because it makes you feel better to give and i sometimes try to weigh that if that is part of why i can not believe it is an attentiongetter because there is nothing to be gained by getting attention for the works you do but maybe just within maybe one feels and i think it is a matter of being conscientious too you know conscientious that there are 

Recording: (4209/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (4210/ 9621) 
it is quite possible but we picked the daycare that i thought was closest to well the one that was open that had the closest values that we had i personally would like a churchbased program but there are not any well there were not any open when we were looking for one we did have the option of going here to osu to their daycare and it has a wonderful reputation and everybody that i have talked to that has had children there is very pleased with the program but what i did not like was so that they were not imparting values on the children they do not celebrate any holidays at all so they just kind of ignore everything where he is now i still like getting my mother is day card i mean they are doing the trick or treat thing on thursday they are going door to door they get a dress up he would not have gotten any of that at osu and there are pros and cons to both of those 

Recording: (4211/ 9621) 
i beat to getting a second job 

Recording: (4212/ 9621) 
like it is okay i mean it is like a country school which was always over to as i was like me and my friends were always like the way because i used to have real long hair and so that was like i used to be like a big hippie or whatever and like um that was i guess weird kinda like being the odd people and in a small like in a small midwestern farming school is kind of odd i guess um 

Recording: (4213/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (4214/ 9621) 
yeah i loved 161 i loved it around there i loved all those cool restaurants and everything 

Recording: (4215/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (4216/ 9621) 
and getting back to the profanity and stuff that was another one was in the paper some of the parents are not leading the children right and it was about this mother and father was doing something all once their little kid maybe six or seven or eight walked in there and said what the h the four letter word it says four and the father is standing and looks at him and after the kids walked out says well where in the h did that child learn to talk like that so you see he gave himself away right away so you see it is the ones that are teaching the kids and it is all those things that i have mentioned before but i think that really it goes back to that what can we do to change it i think as i said basically everybody has to learn to think of the other person and what is good for everybody not just me me me 

Recording: (4217/ 9621) 
mmm 

Recording: (4218/ 9621) 
you know they can do whatever they want 

Recording: (4219/ 9621) 
the proficiency tests that they are now requiring you can not graduate from an ohio high school with a diploma unless you pass all the proficiency tests and that means you have to take one in citizenship which is like government and history one in math one in science one in writing and one in reading and you have you can try to pass the first time at the end of the eighth grade then you get two tries in the ninth grade two tries in the tenth two in the eleventh and two in the twelfth you can take them as many times as you need to take them but if you do not pass them all by the time you graduate you get this nifty little thing called an attendance certificate it is not a real diploma it is like okay i attended i did not learn anything but i was there 

Recording: (4220/ 9621) 
yeah so um-hum right 

Recording: (4221/ 9621)

i have become visually desensitized to the violence that i see in movies and on tv but i still see a distinct difference between that and real violence i mean in studying history i am exposed to a number of rather gruesome events in history that still are very i still find disturbing also hang out in little life bars and every once in a while there will be a fight and it still is disturbing to me i have a distinct difference in my head between reality and fiction and maybe kids are not making that distinction but i do not think so and i think if someone is not making that distinction it is i do not know i do not have any evidence to support it i just know that i feel that i have a distinct a very clear distinction between what is fact and what is fiction what is true and was imaginary and so for me i do not think that television has affected me in that way i mean one way that television has affected me is i am full of media references when i speak when i am hanging out with friends someone mentions a subject and i am like hey simpsons made fun of that at some point that is the effect that it sees on me i do not think that is too big an effect people are always used to you know like quote shakespeare or something i guess that is ten times more elevated so like references the shakespeare line or something but i mean it is a part of our culture and i am a part of it and

a nurse practitioner has more authority i guess to diagnose and see patients the state of ohio is i think the only state that has a given nurse practitioner is prescriptive authority where we can write our own prescriptions so we can see patients do the physicals we can suggest medications i guess per se but then the physician has to come in confirm our findings and then he actually writes the prescriptions

his speed was like say 70 mile an hour before and now it is going to be 20 because he does not know how to do it and that is the problem they are running into they have all these qualified people who know how to separate airplanes and how to get them in trail and everything but now they have got to do this extra part which is going to make their job easier down the road but everybody hates change so what they are doing now is they are having problems because people can not take the volume of airplanes because they are trying to keep up with the computer so it is making it even slower yet but once they get in the swing of things it will be okay but you are talking a while because it is not something that you can do overnight it would be like your dad learning the computer he is not going to do it overnight 

Recording: (4440/ 9621)

well his two main characters in his cartoons were willie and joe 

Recording: (4465/ 9621) 
oh yeah i think she really kind of knows that from conversations with me and stuff while she was growing up my values and stuff basically are more religious oriented than i would say my wife is so i think she knows what i value as being important what i value as being not important but on the rest of the question i would love to have been able to have been there every other weekend sounds good you know as far as 

Recording: (4466/ 9621)

and so i got to be the first graduating class of this brand new school that they built because the old one had just overflowed beyond all recognition 

Recording: (4472/ 9621) 
i can not say that really bothered me too much i mean it is the same thing as having a woman gym teacher or whatever 

Recording: (4473/ 9621) 
i was in 78 and then i have just i have stayed there and it is grown a lot and the work changes it is an interesting place to work because well first the job is almost a different job every year because so many changes are happening we are trying to stay out in front of what in front of what library innovations in front of web and net innovations and try to incorporate it all so it is kind of exciting because you are getting in on things that are really new and trying to master it the project i am working on now is trying to find a way to create data that describes web resources so that libraries can take this data and put it in their catalog and integrate it with their regular collection and we are doing a lot of it with it yeah it is it is a pretty neat project a lot of new things java and the web give us opportunities to do things that we have talked about before but could not really do very well so it is pretty neat 

Recording: (4474/ 9621) 
for people to read i think there is enough other resources out there if somebody is interested in getting that kind of information that they can do that i know for me just because i have so many younger brothers and sisters and my family and everything i know how i have got some some some pretty what i feel are pretty good opinions about how to handle different things and i know that my mom always consults me you know like my sister you know she got her a d in french which vanessa is just she is this girl is almost creepy she is so bright i mean she really is i mean it is one of those things where she just does not turn in her stuff you know and she is 12

Recording: (4481/ 9621)

Recording: (4482/ 9621)

Recording: (4483/ 9621) 
right the competition aspect 

Recording: (4484/ 9621) 
hmm 

Recording: (4485/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (4486/ 9621) 
yeah well like um 

Recording: (4487/ 9621) 
because we want to be because it is a privilege not because oh my god i gotta go to another play you know my daughter just did a play downtown with columbus junior theater and i ushered at 18 performances because i could see it free i did not want to pay 10 bucks every time to see it but if i ushered i could be in the audience every time you know and for my parents to have no interest in seeing seeing play baseball or swims for ohio wesleyan you know or in a play they do not even want to be bothered with that that is just to them and i can not understand that 

Recording: (4488/ 9621) 
yeah so that is pretty much what she likes to do 

Recording: (4489/ 9621) 
a year later uh-huh 

Recording: (4490/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (4491/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (4492/ 9621) 
true communism not as it was practiced in russia but where people share and share power and share money and equally but where we are in our evolution we are not ready for it actually when i was in oregon i did a lot of experimenting and i lived in an intentional community which was actually trying 

Recording: (4493/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4494/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4495/ 9621) 
oh okay 

Recording: (4496/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (4497/ 9621) 
hehe 

Recording: (4498/ 9621) 
so because he and i always discussed politics and stuff 

Recording: (4499/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (4500/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4501/ 9621) 
there generally tends to be at least one or two republicans i vote for each election sometimes i voted straight democrat because i just you know i even voted for dorothy teeter the first time she ran for county commissioner because i liked her style and i thought she was nice and i liked what she was saying but then her votes later on and her positions on some of the issues were against mine so i did not vote for her after that but the first time she ran for county commissioner i did it one because she was a woman and i like you know when possible i like to vote for women 

Recording: (4502/ 9621) 
and i had two little girls and i thought wait a minute you know i my whole life changed because my commitment was to them and to you know get all the opportunities that were out there for them and and it just did not happen that you know that we both had the same he wanted everything to be the same you know so i think that really changed everything it does your whole focus changes because everything you say somebody is listening and everything you want to do somebody is watching 

Recording: (4503/ 9621) 
you are coming with me 

Recording: (4504/ 9621) 
yeah well you get these you probably heard on the news these 15 murders or so since 1991 on the east side and then you got all these people you know i have been in the fights in my neighborhood well my old neighborhood and you know fights people breaking in stealing your stuff and just all out outlandish behavior i mean i caught i actually rode up on a couple people down the street from me having sex through a fence 

Recording: (4505/ 9621) 
i am so much more relaxed i mean the pressures that these kids these days have on them and you are right without families at home to give them the guidance i mean at columbine if i am not mistaking that was the one who had the journal who had somebody had made bombs in the garage and the family did not know about it and i was like how can a family not know that but if they are so busy and working and trying to provide sure 

Recording: (4506/ 9621) 
and then attending grad school 

Recording: (4507/ 9621) 
bar mitzvah 

Recording: (4508/ 9621) 
we are excited it will be fun 

Recording: (4509/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (4510/ 9621) 
yeah they are just so 

Recording: (4511/ 9621) 
yeah because they go back in three days 

Recording: (4512/ 9621) 
i am a big family yeah well as i mentioned a while ago i happen to have to laugh out loud and he said what is so funny of all the names i am looking for from all my family he is finding things for his family i said you know what i found one of them way back in what was it 1670 or something this boatload of people come over from england and they were the ones that had been deported from england because they had done something against the government or something like you know stolen or were the thief or something and i said would you read the only person i can find on my family is nothing but a convict you know you even got deported from the country i do not know why he was there and that is a ship he was on 

Recording: (4513/ 9621) 
took me like 

Recording: (4514/ 9621) 
425 

Recording: (4515/ 9621) 
i think if you had to ask i would say i was a straight midwestern suburbanite but there are people that i go to school with and ashland is 25000 like in the city 

Recording: (4516/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (4517/ 9621) 
it does not have to cost anything but you can go do it with your family or whatever 

Recording: (4518/ 9621) 
scoreboard they are always stopping something and they do not seem to move forward very well 

Recording: (4519/ 9621) 
no i do not either because i believe in the death penalty and i feel taking a life like that leaving someone there just to die 

Recording: (4520/ 9621) 
since she went back to them 

Recording: (4521/ 9621) 
that would be $200 a month 

Recording: (4522/ 9621) 
they really have no selfworth because you know i know a long time ago we went to a what was it it is like a seminar for the ivy league schools which i looked at their tuition and went you know there was no way but and i thought this is so stupid to be here but i listened to the man there was like four or five men talking and some women talking whatever and they said you know if your child makes straight a is and applies at our school we do not want them and i am like what he says we look at two children sitting side by side this one is making straight a is this one is sort of made b is but this one over here got into track when he or she was in freshman and noticed every track meet they basically were like last or second to last but they did it for four years 

Recording: (4523/ 9621) 
being goofy 

Recording: (4524/ 9621) 
you know stuff like that is always been around but it seems now that the guns are more you can get them easier well it is like me i could be carrying a gun right now what are they going to do to me 

Recording: (4525/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (4526/ 9621) 
so yeah i think as a whole we have all kind of gone our separate ways which is scary i mean we do not have the same belief system in anything anymore so it is kind of like oh geez 

Recording: (4527/ 9621) 
if they 

Recording: (4528/ 9621) 
and the safety of the neighborhood and there are a few things really that go into it 

Recording: (4529/ 9621) 
did you really 

Recording: (4530/ 9621) 
around more than somebody else 

Recording: (4531/ 9621) 
now i think that those four kids at least among my grandchildren are getting pretty much at the same training that i did or maybe better than i got my oldest son is two daughters are well they are good kids and they are smart kids but i do not think that they have the moral grounding that greg and beth is kids do you said this is all confidential 

Recording: (4532/ 9621) 
bye 

Recording: (4533/ 9621) 
and move on that is basically my fear but as one of the guys tried to help me he said well listen i am afraid of that too he said because right there in that pit there that is god now if you remember that there is nothing in here that can hurt you even as hot as it gets and when you think about that you try not to think too much while you are in there although it is hard to do especially if you are thinking about how hot it is but if you are listening to people praying and they are praying with their heart and i tell you because of how hot it gets in there you will hear people pray straight from their heart not a bunch of real fancy words in a real comfortable setting you know that heat 

Recording: (4534/ 9621) 
ugh hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe

Recording: (4540/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (4541/ 9621) 
yeah yeah yeah 

Recording: (4542/ 9621) 
no i never did i do not know many people that do but it was also for me i think if i know something is true i just know it and then as long as it keeps on being true over and over again if it is not just some exciting thing that for one day it is like oh this is great but like six months later it still has the same still ringing true and a year later two years later then that is how i feel 

Recording: (4543/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4544/ 9621) 
i just think it is a horribly biased paper they do not really take their journalistic unbiased integrity they do not take that seriously 

Recording: (4545/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (4546/ 9621) 
i mean yes some people

Recording: (4556/ 9621) 
well it probably would have been yeah but they felt that i would change and i have also been a vegetarian for 22 years and when i first decided to do that everyone said oh you will change wait till you get married you will you know and i do not eat any animals at all and it was just a conscious decision 

Recording: (4557/ 9621) 
i think it was the east side i think it was a while ago he has not been there for a while 

Recording: (4558/ 9621) 
hehe 

Recording: (4559/ 9621)

i had fun i enjoyed it it is one of my favorite classes actually for an elective 

Recording: (4562/ 9621) 
i am like you know what hospital is that you know what jury you know so a lot of the things you hear in movies and television about these multimillion dollar lawsuits are is a lie even the lady that i mean sued mcdonald is for spilling the coffee on herself because she put it in her crotch with the lid off you know there a common sense clause in lawsuits her own stupidity and then you get the attorneys trying to argue that well mcdonald is coffee is hotter than every other coffee 

Recording: (4563/ 9621)

Recording: (4568/ 9621) 
yeah pretty interesting everybody talks and frequently nobody is listening and yeah it is pretty interesting talking about how they do not have the money for this and they do not have the money for that and then somebody comes up with well let us spend the money over on something else and nobody acts on it and then they go on to something else 

Recording: (4569/ 9621) 
high school marijuana acid mushrooms 

Recording: (4570/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (4571/ 9621) 
because see i am his stepfather 

Recording: (4572/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (4573/ 9621) 
if they did not give him what he wanted i was like whoa and it was like oh we could get paid i was like no 

Recording: (4574/ 9621) 
off the thing a little bit cause that will be fun 

Recording: (4575/ 9621) 
not much 

Recording: (4576/ 9621) 
when we were in north africa there was one german gun that was firing on us and they could not figure where he was 

Recording: (4577/ 9621) 
you mean at osu 

Recording: (4578/ 9621) 
exactly 

Recording: (4579/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4580/ 9621) 
yeah i think so met quite a few people from cleveland and then my roommates from north canton 

Recording: (4581/ 9621) 
mother used to be a principal of mine in elementary school so uh he is like i think we should talk okay great kisses like a boy you are way too serious for this particular okay that is fine we knew ahead of time that this was all coming to an end do not worry about it so i i uh at this point in the story i should point out that the paper that i went downstairs for i do not know where that is i never found it never saw it never it is anyway not relevant relevant in all the story but it bugs me every time i told the story cuz does not exist anyway so then we come back inside and he is like well i have got some bad news and my sister is like what okay go ahead and he is like no i think you should sit down i am like all right 

Recording: (4582/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4583/ 9621) 
we have a yeah we have 

Recording: (4584/ 9621) 
the herbs the herbs 

Recording: (4585/ 9621) 
i used to when i was driving now especially when i was going through the going to 270 things you know i had people flip me off and stuff like that and the funny thing one time a guy flipped me off because he was going slow and i got all pissed off about it and went around him and everything you know and i go to work pulling an action chemical and he pulls in beside me but him i look over at him he looks at me like oh i am sorry i mean you know 

Recording: (4586/ 9621) 
it is supposed to be an alternative type to the public schools where they can hopefully get a little bit more of the discipline that they might have not 

Recording: (4587/ 9621) 
i think more what they need to do is instruct or just make stiffer penalties to people that carry the guns or that are involved in shootings and things like that because i mean for the most part i mean people really do not get too badly punished for things i mean if you look in other countries i mean like people in like the asian countries places like that i mean they they have really strict laws i mean if you even get caught for like vandalism you are still serving jail time and you get pretty badly punished for it i mean in some cases they will even chain you up and beat you in public for it and i think not to sound too vengeful but i think if more things went that way that there would be a much less problem with it i think just the fact that the jails are so overcrowded now that they know that they are gonna get good time and parole and all sorts of stuff that if you shoot someone you are not even gonna get 30 days in jail and you are gonna be let go i mean that is an awfully small price to pay for 

Recording: (4588/ 9621) 
i am just more of a conservative person i mean i am not sure exactly what his platform is but i have seen him speak a couple times and i do not know he just impresses me more than al gore 

Recording: (4589/ 9621) 
mhm 

Recording: (4590/ 9621) 
well it was rough 

Recording: (4591/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4592/ 9621) 
that is probably what i will do ignore it until like august or july and then start paying attention 

Recording: (4593/ 9621) 
i mean there is always been the nerds and i do not know when i was growing up in the 70s there really was not punk or anything like that and i think unfortunately i mean there is always going to be all different kinds of people to make the world but they have just pushed it to an extreme certain kinds of kids and you know they want to i saw you know i i watch all these shows dateline in 2020 and all this informative shows and how one was in texas run over one of the punk kids was run over by a jock 

Recording: (4594/ 9621) 
and decided to pursue the matter to the extent of marriage so that is where they met so what was it like coming to columbus have you been here a lot no uhuh i come down here two or three times just trips through going to the airport and other miscellaneous things but when i moved to the city it was a real big change because i used to live in the country and then i move into smack dab in the middle of a downtown area 

Recording: (4595/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4596/ 9621) 
what i am saying is 

Recording: (4597/ 9621) 
it is that is weird 

Recording: (4598/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (4599/ 9621) 
well i mean to me the whole thing is wrong regardless of if you are guilty or innocent to me there is worse things i would think than dying i know in israel the guy who killed yitzhak rabin he got locked up and he is not allowed to see it because under jewish law you can not kill 

Recording: (4600/ 9621) 
and i have a wife been married 13 years have two kids age 5 and 7 both of them one is in second grade and the other one is still in daycare at ohio state university 

Recording: (4601/ 9621) 
right and if he is openminded enough to do it eventually he will see the light and say well this will make it a lot easier but there are people who are like i will not do this you know so those are the ones that have to be drug screaming and kicking 

Recording: (4602/ 9621) 
it is saltwater fish 

Recording: (4603/ 9621) 
i mean at that point i certainly did not have any real knowledge about any of that sort of thing they covered the basics they did talk about condoms and contraception i remember we watched a film which everyone was very embarrassed by i mean i do not really they did send home a packet to the parents because i remember being really upset and not wanting my mom to talk with me about it 

Recording: (4604/ 9621) 
yeah the procreation part of what marriage is all about but i see marriage as more than just propagating 

Recording: (4605/ 9621) 
she ran a forklift into a pole and busted her nose and chipped her tooth she is a dangerous woman she gets a lot of tickets sometimes when she is not running into poles we will use them because they normally go to the movie store and just get a movie and bring it home we do that a lot too 

Recording: (4606/ 9621) 
you know the same thing you were talking about and we were only the third people to live in it and so it needed everything you know and it had gold carpet now gold is back but in those days everything was like gold and you know and green it was horrible and it was great fun we had a lot of fun we took the back porch and made it part of the kitchen and had another back porch put on finished the third floor and added a family room and another bedroom we put an inground pool and so i always joke because what i paid for it i now owe three times that amount on it 

Recording: (4607/ 9621) 
and the stern expression or the expression on that face can be equally effective as the smack on the bottom with a bare hand or a switch or whatever it may be i know the most effective penalty for me was my mother would go out near a tree and she would break a twig off and she would smack me across the shoulder and yeah it left marks but sure it hurt i mean it would sting and i understood exactly what was meant i think i grew up and i ended up being i think a quite successful person i think my mother had 13 of the 15 children who lived all pretty doggone decent kids and none of us were injured none of us were hurt and that was a basic method of penalty it was not something that truly hurt injured now today however i suspect my mom could easily be could have been charged with abuse child abuse because it left a mark across my shoulder where that green switch it was always a green switch because the old ones they would break you did not want them to break 

Recording: (4608/ 9621) 
i tend to fear that 

Recording: (4609/ 9621) 
yeah i get on her to make sure she sits down and reads with him because when i get home with him i sit down and do his abcs one two threes but he loves to read books so i try to get her to do that instead of just let them play all day 

Recording: (4610/ 9621) 
i would like to be you know but she lives i keep telling her i wish you would move down here but i am not moving to toledo i do not like toledo 

Recording: (4611/ 9621) 
yeah right 

Recording: (4612/ 9621) 
i am just an operator right now i have done production work too for them 

Recording: (4613/ 9621) 
i mean they did not really do anything too extensive on it that they basically as far as religion classes go they basically told what the catholic church believed about it and how they felt about it but i mean they did not really condemn or support it or anything like that i mean they they basically did realize that it is more up to the person i mean 

Recording: (4614/ 9621) 
interactive they are 

Recording: (4615/ 9621) 
well a little bit near the beginning and that was pretty miserable but it is been a while from there so that is not something that right now i have had anything like that 

Recording: (4616/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4617/ 9621) 
mmhmm yeah but but but many people especially the kid that young may not know what that really means and may is to be part of the group and part of it you know be cool may go along with it when really they do not like it i do not i have not made up my mind about him whether he is telling the truth or whether he has not or whether he was not 

Recording: (4618/ 9621) 
yeah it got boring it got frustrating because we get these new people moving in and you are used to everything being nice you know and then you get people next door breaking into you or upstairs from you breaking into you 

Recording: (4619/ 9621) 
oh my 

Recording: (4620/ 9621) 
we want a dog and we have kind of been waiting but i like both animals 

Recording: (4621/ 9621)

but the federal government and their lawyers have done that and the department of the interior still considers native americans on the same level as a dog they do not have rights there is something wrong there and that still goes on today after about 600 years and we got good people in this country that want to do something about it but unfortunately what i am finding everybody is got to choose their path 

Recording: (4639/ 9621) 
right right

Recording: (4647/ 9621) 
so now he is back in the lawn care until something else better comes along 

Recording: (4648/ 9621) 
and i know it sounds crazy but i would rather have 10 animals and take care of them and different kinds of animals than children i do not know why i knew at a very young age that it just was not important to me it would not be a part of my life 

Recording: (4649/ 9621) 
i know another thing about the kids nowadays is and devin i experienced it with her you know i sent her $100 one time you know just for her and she sat there and said i called her up a couple days later or about a week later or something like that and said what would you do with that what would you get with that money and everything she goes well you know i bought a gap tshirt and a cd and i said um-hum she goes what do you mean that is what i bought and i said you bought a cd and you bought a blouse 

Recording: (4650/ 9621) 
that is a real major question is not it no i do not think it is too bad i mean well we could go into the issue of the columbus board of education what is his name he is always 

Recording: (4651/ 9621) 
and they had a strong public support over there it is a really tightknit community it is quite different columbus needs to learn a lot from that area and it is a matter of just putting i guess your hands in thepracticing your faith which we 

Recording: (4652/ 9621) 
open to that tunnel and they fired a couple of our shells into the tunnel and then took off 

Recording: (4653/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (4654/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4655/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (4656/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (4657/ 9621) 
yeah so you know his friend lives on the other side you know it is like a duplex and his friend lived on the other side and he he also was broken into but they came through his bathroom window 

Recording: (4658/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4659/ 9621) 
and that is so sad for our city 

Recording: (4660/ 9621) 
um so they are coming up and there is been like divorce papers and stuff on it and i know that police officers are occasionally used to deliver important documents i do not personally think that divorce documents are that important but nothing is beyond the realm of possibility for people to take things way out way too seriously yes 

Recording: (4661/ 9621) 
well see we have real traditional breakdown of chores but only because that is just happened to be what we like the way we like it do you know what i mean and it is not because you know i consider my whole household a lot of feminists you know we are all real strong about that but the thing is since i have the luxury of being at home and peter is doing a job that he really enjoys and i am doing something i enjoy i really am happy to do all of those things that typically women do because that is my job that is my trade off i do not have to go someplace else i can go and have coffee every day with my daughters i can go and do whatever i want and i am happy to do these other things 

Recording: (4662/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4663/ 9621) 
i think that step would be really fun i have never done it but it always looks like so much fun to me 

Recording: (4664/ 9621) 
yeah exactly medicaid i think i think 

Recording: (4665/ 9621) 
every day the other one i do not see that much anymore 

Recording: (4666/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (4667/ 9621) 
i do not think that changed my mind about anything i mean i do not approve of his immoral behavior but it does not change the way he runs the country 

Recording: (4668/ 9621) 
โตกรี่ด้วย 

Recording: (4669/ 9621) 
yeah i contributed to too many people there is too many people there is not enough commitment it is too easy to get divorced and the competition i mean there is just tons and tons of just people everywhere and young people today i do not know what the statistics are going to be but i do not think they have a good idea of what marriage even is also before marriage was a commitment to a type of lifestyle and that lifestyle is gone everybody is independent everybody is going their own ways and if you happen to be lucky enough to find somebody that is looking in the same direction you are and is equally as independent then it might but who knows why each person gets divorced i mean each one of them was an individual situation 

Recording: (4670/ 9621) 
oh that is great 

Recording: (4671/ 9621) 
exactly 

Recording: (4672/ 9621) 
just kind of instincts i guess yeah actually there are quite a there is a pretty wellknown doctor that has a ton of books and i go to la leche league and that is kind of their philosophy in a way yeah just that breastfeeding is you know a way to mother and nurture and feed and you know it meets all of often their iqs are higher and it is just amazing to me that she actually read a study that they did from breastfed babies to bottle fed babies and they said the difference in their iq is equivalent to a regular bottle fed baby and a baby exposed to lead poisoning it is that much higher even so i mean it is just given them that much of a better head start on development so 

Recording: (4673/ 9621) 
yeah but some names are just like we had a friend once she got pregnant like after her two boys were almost grown up and they did not ever expect to have another kid and her mother died during her pregnancy so she named the little girl after her mother and the mother is name was harriet

where are you from 

Recording: (4679/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (4680/ 9621)

Recording: (4688/ 9621) 
i am just kidding 

Recording: (4689/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (4690/ 9621) 
it has a lot to do with the fact that the church 

Recording: (4691/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4692/ 9621) 
i think in fifth grade was the first 

Recording: (4693/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (4694/ 9621) 
i think that is kind of where i am coming from jan and i know you jan i mean what my sister does i just say to her i just really admire it i can not give as much as she gives i just do not have that same spirit she has but it is great to see i mean she is real she really when she is with the people i do not know i have this thing probably about me that you know you can stand on your own two feet and you can lead a better life but janet just envelops them with her kindness and probably has less expectations from the people she works with 

Recording: (4695/ 9621) 
oh i would be surprised 

Recording: (4696/ 9621) 
time to go all right i am done here 

Recording: (4697/ 9621) 
i do not think so now with the diversity that we have here 

Recording: (4698/ 9621) 
get back to god get back to believing in god and the values that the family should have i do not know how is that connected well god did not teach you to go out and shoot your neighbor and he did not go out and tell you to steal from him and he did not tell you to ignore him the rest of your life he did not tell you that they are down there bleeding to death oh walk and turn the other way i mean he taught you to help and be loving toward each other and it is lacking in a lot people today as i said that that is that old me me me me thing or iii or however you want to say i really think that that is most of it and i do not know how people i got a letter the other day and i can not remember the name of the personality that was doing it be sending out these things about how you can sign up to take him right in and say do not have these kind of tv programs on anymore where they use a profanity where they use the drinking where they use a dope and where they use the vulgarity and i understand this thing about him being a her and her being a him what is what is what word am i looking for right now that i have lost 

Recording: (4699/ 9621) 
collegewise i do not know anyone of college age that is gay

mbc 뉴스 김재경입니다 

Recording: (4709/ 9621) 
and come back in 

Recording: (4710/ 9621) 
a little bit north of north broadway right along the freeway there did not used to be a bad neighborhood but now it is just kinda you got the little kids growing up and doing shit that you know you picture yourself doing as a child one way or another you know now you throw rocks around and stuff and accidentally break a window run away 

Recording: (4711/ 9621) 
that is true sometimes we have trouble finding enough violists or something you know an instrument like that but they usually get enough to play a concert sometimes we have to bring in a couple of instrumentalists for last few rehearsals so we sort of have stringers i guess you would call them yeah we have actually been on wsu also radio on music in mid ohio our recording last year yeah of beethoven is ninth got on music in mid ohio yeah we used the otterbein college choir 

Recording: (4712/ 9621) 
well i would sit down and talk to her like you know if you want to have sex if you really want to have sex you should get on some kind of birth control 

Recording: (4713/ 9621) 
yeah well i played music and stuff with a lot of my friends i do not know basically just standard teenage stuff sitting around watching tv and i do not know just running around or whatever but in high school it was always just real like you put in a tiny little bit of effort and you get a b and that is good enough i guess 

Recording: (4714/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4715/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4716/ 9621) 
do this 

Recording: (4717/ 9621) 
sophomore year again and ended up getting married after i finished my master is 

Recording: (4718/ 9621) 
no yeah i guess it is you 

Recording: (4719/ 9621) 
during school but at the same time i mean as long as the parents love the kids it does not really matter what sex they are and they treat them well so i mean that is kind of a tough question to answer i mean it is almost it is something that they almost need to ask the kids but obviously at the age that they would be adopting them they obviously would not know how to answer that question yeah 

Recording: (4720/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4721/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (4722/ 9621) 
but how she got there she started out somewhere 

Recording: (4723/ 9621) 
yeah yeah yeah she probably got i do not know maybe even she sold drugs or you know whatever kind of way she made her money but it would not have been enough welfare wise to get a car and to 

Recording: (4724/ 9621) 
but it is mind boggling that it is because i came from a small community there were only 200 people in my senior class and you knew everybody and now you are talking two whole high schools two football teams it is just mind boggling all these people you graduate with no handful of people and do not know anybody else it is like a lot more of a tight knit group as a child so we had three elementary schools and one high school and that was it 

Recording: (4725/ 9621) 
because conceivably they wanted what was it a $2 raise or something and then they also get free tuition but only as i understand it only a very small percentage get that free tuition 

Recording: (4726/ 9621) 
well but see i think if you really try to tell kids and especially women that you know you should sex is something that should be between two people that love each other and unless you really feel love and really think it is love then you know you should not do it 

Recording: (4727/ 9621) 
right right well let me ask you about somebody else who is not that well known do you know john gorka have you heard of him he is really worth looking into he is funny he has good songs he is a folk singer really along the lines of maybe arlo guthrie or somebody i mean he does electric stuff sometimes but he also does acoustic and he writes most of his own songs yeah and if you ever see something by him you should get it or if you see it in a friend is collection ask to listen to it he has funny funny some of the songs are really funny and some of them are the saddest things you have ever heard yeah yeah just tragic things let is see funny ones are examples of funny ones are winter cows let is see i can not think too much of them right now but yeah 

Recording: (4728/ 9621) 
but just that freedom you know to do what you want to get some sleep to eat to take care of yourself to do a little investigation on your own to pray about it whatnot and then it is really clear but if you do not get that and you are always thrust back into it i do not think you can break free 

Recording: (4729/ 9621) 
i think 

Recording: (4730/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4731/ 9621) 
they have just gotten a lot worse like my niece my sister had moved in with me for a little bit when her husband was having problems and my niece is eight well she was in fifth grade and there is elementary school that we went to when we were kids and she just said they were cursing smoking cigarettes and everything and i just am like oh my gosh 

Recording: (4732/ 9621) 
all of creation into religion all of what spirituality is into one word religion you can not but when you say it is of spiritual nature that is still leaving the door wide open it is broad it is bigger than you or me but that whole thing is you know the people of the land had specific instructions on how to do things and i am not saying they were perfect either there were a lot of indian people and there are a lot of indian people out there that are crooked as a dog is eye and leg that is just the way it is they are corrupt the money has corrupted them the lack of money has corrupted them power has corrupted them they want to be a spiritual leader why i do not know to me it is an ego thing and this rainbow eagle guy had some kind of buffalo what do you call it a buffalo ceremony but he charged everybody native people do not do that i mean traditional native people you do not charge people that want to come learn about god there is some people in california that say certain ceremonies were a native thing and they buried a woman in the ground with a straw told her it was some ritual of proving and overcoming fear yet the lady was an asthmatic and she was clothed native american spirituality should be outlawed and if you look at any kind of spirituality or religion that is out there native americans are the only ones that have legislation actually saying what you can and can not have that there is blood quantums saying that if you have a fourth or a half

mhm 

Recording: (4738/ 9621) 
peace 

Recording: (4739/ 9621) 
by the time you get there you are all lagged out 

Recording: (4740/ 9621) 
god i have seen a few infomercials on stuff like that but i can not say anything too serious to come up from it 

Recording: (4741/ 9621) 
but you are working now janet 

Recording: (4742/ 9621) 
as much probably 

Recording: (4743/ 9621) 
i am not real up on this i know that he is done some things 

Recording: (4744/ 9621) 
did not i 

Recording: (4745/ 9621) 
but he just did not have a very high opinion of the army 

Recording: (4746/ 9621) 
everybody is code 

Recording: (4747/ 9621) 
so it seems the picture is kind of hard to deal with people that are into capitalism have a pretty good lives and they have what they want and they do not seem to have such serious problems so people who try to go against that current can get it their selves into big trouble so and capitalism has made the united states go i mean it has worked and we are ahead of the world there is no question about that in what the individual people persons have and how their lives go much better on the other hand you know i am actually what i would like if it would just spread all over the world true communism 

Recording: (4748/ 9621) 
of the people of this land there is a ceremony called an inipi which is a sweat lodge and a lot of people talk about sweat lodge it involves heating up stones in a fire and putting the stones in the lodge and pouring water over them and closing the door and singing songs it is not a sauna it is not a steam room 

Recording: (4749/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (4750/ 9621) 
how many times have you been in ireland 

Recording: (4751/ 9621) 
não 

Recording: (4752/ 9621) 
you know shoot him or whatever 

Recording: (4753/ 9621) 
he had a variety eighth grade is probably in some ways his better year he had taken computer class for a grading period it was not going well they were teaching keyboarding where he learned that when he was in third grade so we were talking to the teacher and i said well he is disruptive he is supposed to be doing keyboarding exercises and he is writing programs and he said i knew the first day he was in here he knew everything that i was going to teach this grading period well that kind of flew up a red flag to me can you give him other assignments oh no he is got to do whatever bounce is doing so we went to the principal and i was president of the parents advisory committee at the time so i had easy access to the principal he took him out of the class immediately and put him in the library and the librarian worked with him oneonone teaching database and spreadsheet applications to him but he had another teacher in the ninth grade who contacted us his english teacher and she told us she said he knows everything i want to teach so i want your permission to give him a separate curriculum and she did he was using reading books like invisible man by elliman ellison ralph ellison and elliman i guess it is anyway and writing papers on it he was reading like three books by an author and then trying to write a short story in that author is style and she still tested him with the other kids just to make sure he had not missed anything and he was using her grad school notes to write papers and stuff like this and he loved it and that is what he needed but when we got to high school and we would talk to teachers about this they said no they could not do that it was very frustrating 

Recording: (4754/ 9621) 
or american literature or anything 

Recording: (4755/ 9621) 
no no not at all she is not watching ashland 

Recording: (4756/ 9621) 
probably gonna lighten me again you know and then a lot of them i do not think are capable well in the present condition i know like the friend of mine i am talking about there is no way in hell that he could hold down a job 

Recording: (4757/ 9621) 
yeah it is great and they like it they sing a song they interact with other kids and learn to use the library nowadays people do not go to the library as much you either get your information off the internet or you buy books so we have felt that if we introduce them now that hopefully this will lead on later and this way you can monitor their television we let them rent a couple movies here and there but we see what they rent or take out compared to the cartoon network and all these crazy cartoons just seem so worthless nowadays but actually you watch some of the older cartoons that we watched and they seem more violent than some of the new ones you know daffy duck and the road runner and these type of things all it was was kill the fox you know so we are just like wow i do not know if we want to let them watch that either yeah and disney and disney is pretty strong i mean you know you think of disney and you think of kids but you still a lot of the with them sometimes that i think you will be all right oh yeah absolutely yeah it is tough sometimes read the paper at the same time yeah yeah like the fiveyearold is addicted to the tarzan he likes the tarzan movie that was out yeah he wants to we have kind of boycotted him the daughter wants to throw it away never do not have to watch that again 

Recording: (4758/ 9621) 
and she is kind of big chested she is my height but the baby is like all under you do not see it i mean unless you push her shirt down 

Recording: (4759/ 9621) 
they are just not getting it right 

Recording: (4760/ 9621) 
i plan at this point to pursue history to the phd level anything of course can happen 

Recording: (4761/ 9621) 
this is weird 

Recording: (4762/ 9621) 
well i know but you know it struck me as funny at the time because that is the way it was worded 

Recording: (4763/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (4764/ 9621) 
yeah well it was like i kind of just like stopped going to class and and like i just like ended up withdrawing because i would have like failed everything anyways but yeah then i was living with my friend for a while but and then like no no me and her and my other friend living down on maynard and 

Recording: (4765/ 9621) 
it is like right there 

Recording: (4766/ 9621) 
you have to go to dances you have to do that whole thing so i really do not know how they would go about doing that perhaps like i know we used to have like we had like the administrators actually allowed us to have a day where everyone like the whole class as a class could go have a picnic like in the practice football field and that was cool because everyone got along those days because you did not have to go to class you know you spend the second half of the day just hanging out so everyone got along that way and i think that would be a start you know but then that hurts the administrators in the sense that they are there to provide an education so it would be rough and like my high school they put up cameras and they had like they locked bathrooms like at certain times you could not go in them like it in like it was getting and they had like we are on the front page of the american journal because they had a lockdown where no one was allowed to leave their classroom and then they brought the dogs through and they found i was surprised they found a lot of drugs 

Recording: (4767/ 9621) 
they are prevented from doing much yeah yeah i just do not think that they can do much and i am sure it is very frustrating for them well and i know it is we had a friend who was a teacher she just retired a couple years ago she is about our age and it is very different now she said it is scary going into the classroom sometimes and before it was not that you knew that if you had a problem you could make a you know go and get something dealt with it now you can not get backing on it 

Recording: (4768/ 9621) 
so he will not have to pay for it 

Recording: (4769/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (4770/ 9621)

no no no it is not you can do whatever you want i have heard conferences where i have heard the prophet talk about how you should keep in touch with the people that you served in or the people that you worked with and that you knew and that they even if you can not remember how to speak just try and send them a letter and i have been really bad about that so i feel a lot of pressure to i need to i mean i just do not want to lose contact with them because you get these great friendships but yeah you can there is i know people that have married people from their i mean that is really not supposed to happen while you are on your mission but when you are done if you want to go back that happens too but it is really not looked i mean you should not that is against the rules on the mission if people want to get married when they get home that is fine but yeah it is another thing where you are trying to focus on your work and you are not allowed to date never alone but you can live where you served you can do whatever you want after you are done 

Recording: (4793/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4794/ 9621)

Recording: (4800/ 9621) 
right so a lot of them already believe that they have their own religion and they are really faithful so that was one of the main problems is that they had been so holding on to that for so long it is so strong they do not want to let go of and then the men their problem was usually that they would drink a lot 

Recording: (4801/ 9621) 
i had enough friends who said to me can you make money with computers and i said yes you can make money with computers and they said what could i make money with computers

Recording: (4843/ 9621) 
amazing how much the growth in delaware and different areas when i was growing up here and how marysville and it was such a farm town just the growth of the different cities and suburbs of columbus is amazing and the housing and 

Recording: (4844/ 9621) 
yeah i do not know why columbus was just stubborn about it until the last year they had not been able to get substitutes 50 of the time and so the teachers were screaming and they were splitting the kids up and putting them in other classrooms well i do not know if the parents made anything about it but i guess finally you know when you have 50 of your classrooms uncovered they came to it and it got so used to be nobody appreciated a substitute nobody the kids the principal or the other teachers but now it is like oh thank you for coming oh thank you for coming so i said maybe that worked a little bit but now just in the last two weeks i think a lot of the retired teachers who were not messing around with it have come back in so i do not know exactly what is 

Recording: (4845/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (4846/ 9621)

Recording: (4847/ 9621) 
do not waste like thirty dollars on the commemorative coins or something and i do not even know what they are doing or to like when it is really apparent that people should not be charging this on their credit card when it is like you put in one credit card and it does not go through because it is max h one i am like no do not do that like we can do that you can get in trouble or whatever and it is just funny how it is real weird at our office that um uh is it the first place that i have been to where you clock in that is kind of odd kind of like think of a factory like a punch card or something and just how there is this whole thing we can not wear hats in the building and this whole thing about trying to have a professional attitude and stuff it is just real funny to hear people speak like that and really believe it 

Recording: (4848/ 9621)

i have always heard and i am very clean anyways but when you have to vacuum a lot and everything and you are constantly picking up that dander rather than just let it sit and accumulate 

Recording: (4852/ 9621) 
and you are loving it too at least you are trying to convince yourself of it 

Recording: (4853/ 9621) 
well there is i mean pretty much you just keep making calls making appointments sending out slides it helps if you can get a you know if you know an artist who is in a gallery you know if you can use them as a reference but that it is mainly just you just have to knock on a lot of doors and be prepared for a lot of no is 

Recording: (4854/ 9621)

when i would run away from foster homes 

Recording: (4861/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (4862/ 9621) 
i think they should be i think they should be subject to the same rigorous scrutiny that hetero couples are you know with home visits and economic tests and all these kind of things but the gay people i know the ones that would want to be parents i think would make great parents 

Recording: (4863/ 9621) 
i think just having like such a low cost really helps

she was the rudest woman 

Recording: (4867/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (4868/ 9621) 
so family familiarity and just the community i think if you had to name three negative things about columbus what would you say what would you choose crime i think is going up and up traffic is horrendous but i mean you need to go through that right now because columbus is expanding so much that we need the orange brails and i guess the lack of publicity nationally i think we do not have you know like the national football teams and now with the hockey coming i think we are getting more recognition but when people talk about about columbus i do not think they know columbus ohio or columbus georgia or columbus where right 

Recording: (4869/ 9621) 
not doing anything my son you know with his disorder he would constantly be late for school and i called the school and told them this was in high school 

Recording: (4870/ 9621)

Recording: (4878/ 9621)

Recording: (4879/ 9621) 
some of the really hard questions why do bad things happen to good people people can not just accept that bad things happen to good people they wanna know why i do not know why i mean yeah i have a personal relationship with my god but we are not on a conversational i am on this side of the table you are on that side of the table why did this happen he does not see fit to tell me why something happens unless it pertains to me let is see what is another really hard one one of the biggest ones with people my age is apologetics apologetics which is going out and saying you are a sinner except christ everybody on this campus has heard of brother jed he runs around on the oval going slut whore yada yada yada and that is just i mean there are a lot of people within the community of christians who can not stand that we do not like what he is doing because yeah i am one of them because we have to go back anyone who has been influenced by him we have to go back and we have to undo all the damage he is done before we can really start in on them and helping them to understand what we are trying to tell them we have to undo what brother jed has done because he is just i mean yeah maybe his heart is in the right place but he is doing it the wrong way but one of the big things is right after you are done doing all of the spiel about why you think they should accept christ in their life they say okay that is good for you and that is the general feeling among people our age our generation i mean what generation are we anyways i am 20 so there is like the generation x they are the generation right after me and then there is generation y2k they are the generation right before me so we are stuck right in the middle i do not even think we have a generation 

Recording: (4880/ 9621) 
just kidding 

Recording: (4881/ 9621) 
yeah it is on olentangy down there north of there 

Recording: (4882/ 9621)

Recording: (4885/ 9621)

Recording: (4890/ 9621) 
because they like it they like school and that is why they came to college football was secondary 

Recording: (4891/ 9621) 
well the problem is like say every airline wants to go to new york city and they want all their businessmen there at 8 am well an airport has so many runways and so many taxiways and you know like say 10 airplanes every 10 minutes can come in and out of those airports well they end up shooting like 30 there so instead of letting them all get in the air and stand up there and hold while they are shooting them in what they do is they will like say going to ohare you have to call for release times to these different airports and they will say well he can not go right now but he can go like at 27 past the hour so they know by looking at the entire picture and how many airplanes are coming to that airport when he will fit in so it is not so much air traffic delays it is airlines that cause it themselves it is like you and i and 500 people want to get to this room 10 oclock today well rather than say why do not some of you come at 10 and another group come at 1015 and we are all trying to do the same thing at once and it does not work work you can only get so many people through that door and if you say i am going to take five at a time they can get in but if you say i am taking 500 at a time it does not work the airlines always go it is the government and regulations and that is why we are delayed and it is really them themselves 

Recording: (4892/ 9621)

well i am very much my baseline philosophy is thou shalt not kill and that goes really a long ways for me that includes being a vegetarian and most of our wars i would have said no let us not do this yet although on the other hand i have to admit that there has been some stuff that we have not been able to stop without it and that is too bad you know that things have been that bad in some like a world war ii i mean we did not really have any choice there but some of our wars have been unnecessary but you can get a philosophy but it does not always apply every single case you know what i mean i am against capital punishment the guy that they executed here in ohio last fall did you know about it 

Recording: (4909/ 9621) 
that is what i would think in that case i mean because the dominant culture is always going to be accessible to them 

Recording: (4910/ 9621) 
yeah but if you were the first state in the union to do it it will cost you millions and millions and it would be rough it would be so hard to

Recording: (4917/ 9621) 
yeah it is a change of pace and plus being around my sister instead of you know taking the 20 mile lag all the way up there just go a couple blocks over and there she is 

Recording: (4918/ 9621) 
really what did he tell you 

Recording: (4919/ 9621) 
and so basically they decided to build a new building adjacent to the church tacton and we they asked the choir for input 

Recording: (4920/ 9621) 
no it was more black than white to tell you the truth or it might have been even but now it is more black than white definitely now because i live in a neighborhood where it is mostly black than white and that is where i have always lived my whole life 

Recording: (4921/ 9621) 
it is like it is um it is like there is flyers and stuff that you see or whatever and you get directions to it and it will be in a bunch of different places it will be in a sports arena or something or it depends how big they are there is ones where there is like two hundred people there is ones where there is like five there is ones where there is a thousand there is ones where there are like three thousand and there is ones in can i did not go to one but some of my friends went to it where there is like fifteen thousand people there or something like that 

Recording: (4922/ 9621) 
and they do everything they possibly can to make me happy and it is like my oldest girl we are expecting our first grandchild here within a couple weeks and she and i see each other all the time my daughter who goes to chose to live at home because she just said it was just a better situation for her and it is not that these girls are not independent and can not do it on their own megan could my second daughter could have lived on her own from the time she was 12 i mean she is just very very mature very driven the only problem she has she did not have a job to support herself other than that she could have taken care of herself but she chooses to be still at home and be a part of our life and my son both those kids have four points i mean they really work hard in school because they know it is important and my son was he was the only one that was in seventh and eighth grade he took that time to do the maturing that most of his friends are doing at 16 and so i am really lucky that we had our difficulty at that point and it was minimal but to me having been used to everything being perfect it was like for him to have 

Recording: (4923/ 9621) 
i am just kidding 

Recording: (4924/ 9621) 
grandchildren mmhmm yeah 

Recording: (4925/ 9621)

Recording: (4926/ 9621) 
yeah dilutes there is only so much talent so it dilutes it

Recording: (4930/ 9621)

Recording: (4932/ 9621)

Recording: (4933/ 9621)

Recording: (4934/ 9621)

Recording: (4935/ 9621) 
very big differences stuck together on a small ship they just glassed over those and it became just like the next generation except for they did not talk to the federation as much anymore so i did not like that one so much 

Recording: (4936/ 9621)

Recording: (4940/ 9621) 
some of them are all of the above and some of them are not there is quite a few of them that have adjusted well to society when they came home biggest thing i think when what happened is that there was not any joy about like world war ii and korea you know it is like you came off got off the plane and nobody really cared you know 

Recording: (4941/ 9621) 
that is a rule coming down hand down

Recording: (4969/ 9621) 
it was like give them a license to be a screw up a lot of the nurses even who were former addicts when it came down to doing procedure and doing business the way it should be done they were not following protocol and of course me i would be the one saying hey you are not following protocol and they would say well i am a former addict i am allowed to do that 

Recording: (4970/ 9621) 
it is just a challenge to figure out how to make something work i am just incredibly optimistic i really feel like whatever happens to me it is my responsibility to help it happen take care of it deal with it i always have a backup plan 

Recording: (4971/ 9621) 
mbc 뉴스 김지경입니다 

Recording: (4972/ 9621) 
so you know downstairs there is five different sectors so they split the area up into five different areas and you know there are some sectors down there that get extremely busy and then sometimes it is just like you know you are twiddling your thumbs it is like feast or famine you know it is not like steady like if you are working at meijer running the cash register it is just kind of like steady it is like you look at you know you would be like sitting at meijer and there is no one in your line and then you turn your back and turn back around and there is like 75 

Recording: (4973/ 9621) 
i mean you know i have little thoughts of like i like to design i am maybe a designer but you know like i went to i was in police law enforcement 

Recording: (4974/ 9621) 
i come from the east coast 

Recording: (4975/ 9621) 
and the people that would be decent parent are not because of the situations and whatnot just my family nobody in my family my sister does not have kids i do not have kids we are in our mid to late 30s our friends just had one i do have some friends that have like more than one which is great because they are just great parents i know those kids are gonna be going in but then i have other people that like my other friends that just had one were trying to help a child in children is services that came from horror 

Recording: (4976/ 9621) 
yeah they gave us $9 a day it was like $925 for what meal plan i was on so then we bought like poptarts and that lasted for like a week of breakfast 

Recording: (4977/ 9621)

Recording: (4978/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (4979/ 9621) 
so this is my first time like a doggie so 

Recording: (4980/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4981/ 9621) 
well the opinion kind of like the general consensus around upper arlington is that osu is not a good enough school 

Recording: (4982/ 9621) 
hmm 

Recording: (4983/ 9621) 
this is the there is no faulting any of these folks but still there is nothing else to do and there is nothing creative in response to say this experience so you end up with your kidding again and again and again and you had two individuals who said you are kidding and then immediately following it out never mind pretend i never said that 

Recording: (4984/ 9621) 
sure 

Recording: (4985/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4986/ 9621) 
yeah there were white skinheads at our school that were racist against me for hanging around black people i guess i am sure there was black people that were racist too but not in school i did not have problems really 

Recording: (4987/ 9621) 
yeah i actually have a bunch of numbers here that i hope i did not lose yeah i got three people to call see about jobs there should be in within the middle of the week yeah because gas money is i can do construction cooking i actually took columbus public schools cooking test and passed it so i am technically a cook 

Recording: (4988/ 9621) 
right but how old is your kid 

Recording: (4989/ 9621) 
anyway 

Recording: (4990/ 9621) 
neither one of them is married or have kids my sister does have a boyfriend for probably like three years or so and there is talk about marriage and kids and stuff like that with them 

Recording: (4991/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (4992/ 9621) 
that is cool 

Recording: (4993/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (4994/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4995/ 9621) 
i like management here 

Recording: (4996/ 9621) 
those are your 

Recording: (4997/ 9621) 
hmm how would you end up in ohio 

Recording: (4998/ 9621) 
the food service and she knows that they are really bad and that is really sad but they are not doing anything about it 

Recording: (4999/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (5000/ 9621) 
right right well it is sort of a problem as well that you know those i mean it seems you know from what i have read if you wanted to make a bomb it is fairly uncomplicated you know so 

Recording: (5001/ 9621) 
that is right in other words it is so much me anymore instead of us and we 

Recording: (5002/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5003/ 9621) 
yeah it is not like a skilled profession to me 

Recording: (5004/ 9621) 
but see that is because i do not think americans travel as much as the europeans do i guess because europeans they have more public transportation accessible they get the trains the eurotrains and the buses but just by personal car you can go across the border you can go visit countries it is so condensed but here it is like we have got our oceans and it is like we gotta fly so i think that is why i think europeans are much more cooler in that respect they are much more cosmopolitan just because it is no big deal for somebody in europe to speak like seven languages right here it is like you who actually knows english you know so i think that is what i will find hopefully hopefully 

Recording: (5005/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5006/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5007/ 9621) 
yeah i think it is further east than where i was i was right in the ural mountains so it is like the border of europe and asia 

Recording: (5008/ 9621) 
so they are close but i try to avoid seeing them except my grandfather who is a nice charitable human being the others are all nice and sweet and stuff but do not have enough rewarding characteristics to make me want to spend lots of time around them 

Recording: (5009/ 9621) 
it is and it was world war two that brought them together my my dad was in at the end of the war he was in the army air corps he never had to go overseas but he was stationed in louisiana 

Recording: (5010/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5011/ 9621) 
not so much old star trek i like deep space nine of the new ones back when it was new i liked the next generation but once deep space nine came out and it had a grittier darker story that was not so cookie cutter in fashion there was a greater degree of continuity from episode to episode and more character development it was not like these perfect people on this ship going and facing bad people the characters themselves had flaws and that caused for better drama so i like that do not like voyager so much i see that when it first came out i had high hopes because i saw it as something that would be even grittier they had the potential for excellent intercharacter conflict but they glossed over all those immediately within the first season and that really bothered me ultimately this story they are trapped but they do not really pursue the issues of being separated from home and two factions that had 

Recording: (5012/ 9621) 
they settled in springfield ohio and then my mom met my father he was from petoskey they met here at osu when they were going to college and they settled here in columbus 

Recording: (5013/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5014/ 9621) 
you know she says something about you sure you are not a football player or something you know you got that significant signature there going 

Recording: (5015/ 9621) 
and i would definitely keep an eye out and figure out what is going on 

Recording: (5016/ 9621) 
you hang out like i do not know it is more of like a super like a suburban town as opposed to like a centralized downtown yeah it is just like you know like a half an hour i mean 20 minutes outside you can get to dublin or 15 minutes to dublin or something like that and i mean that is still like a part of columbus as opposed to yeah 

Recording: (5017/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5018/ 9621) 
yeah they have well ok they do have sales tax but it is added into the price before so you are not just sitting there trying to figure out what it is 

Recording: (5019/ 9621) 
hehe 

Recording: (5020/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5021/ 9621) 
right and all the babies in the hospital will be covered under my son is insurance and she is covered under her father is insurance so their medical expenses are not going to be very big 

Recording: (5022/ 9621) 
yeah you go to class in one building and you go across the yard to another and then you go to lunch and then you come across another and your locker and all that stuff it is just like a mini campus 

Recording: (5023/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5024/ 9621) 
so i do not know she likes it 

Recording: (5025/ 9621) 
yeah man i do not want to be over in the next county you know driving in the middle of the sky going yeah a couple people down there floating around under me 

Recording: (5026/ 9621) 
and it seems to be a fairly conservative university as well 

Recording: (5027/ 9621) 
i mean not that i do not want to be on welfare it is like a down when i want to go up you know 

Recording: (5028/ 9621) 
uh as well actually when i was at ohio state i worked for the newspaper 

Recording: (5029/ 9621) 
how would you do this to me 

Recording: (5030/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5031/ 9621) 
but that is because i am not home a lot and like i said my wife is here now her mom just moved to texas so she is living down in texas and she is got brothers and sisters all over the united states 

Recording: (5032/ 9621) 
um it is probably worse i mean actually just wait for my last experiments i heard a couple people talking about it talking about it 

Recording: (5033/ 9621) 
not this job no 

Recording: (5034/ 9621) 
bye 

Recording: (5035/ 9621) 
right and that is it they have not had a challenge you need to have a challenge that is put to you every day every day so you have more meaningfulness in life so that when you put your head down at night you are saying you know i am thankful for what i did gosh darn it i am still coming to you i need more help tomorrow because without something intangible there is going to be a motivation factor something is got to give you the adrenaline to get up tomorrow morning and say hey i am going to do a better job today than i did yesterday something lower the bar a little more 

Recording: (5036/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5037/ 9621) 
i do not know and well i do not know for a while we got it stopped the thing that is confusing to me is that sometimes we will get something stopped for 25 or 30 years or 10 or 15 and then we go back it is like hey we got moved ourselves out of that why are we going back to it now and i think you know the papers keep saying that our crime rate is going down and everything and so i think that is because we some people are you know trying to make it deal with these people as people who are ill or sick and try to help them with their you know it took us a long time to figure out that alcoholism is a disease okay so now we try to help alcoholics well certainly murdering is a disease 

Recording: (5038/ 9621) 
no this all started long before that actually just recently he seems to have accepted the idea that yes the baby is going to be born i think he just kind of tried to ignore it for a long time but i think it is all very obvious now and she is great 

Recording: (5039/ 9621) 
does your husband like that 

Recording: (5040/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (5041/ 9621)

Recording: (5044/ 9621) 
i mean i personally would not care if i was in a foxhole with somebody i could care less whether he was gay or not as long as he could shoot a gun to help me out if i was in trouble 

Recording: (5045/ 9621) 
i do not want to like i do not want to spin like i just want to like i am gonna try and do different things like like most music i listen to is like drum and bass where it is like bass lines and like 

Recording: (5046/ 9621)

Recording: (5054/ 9621)

Recording: (5068/ 9621)

if she could have become the candidate she might have been able to beat i think almost anybody can beat gore right now but in election times a weekend is a couple centuries a year is an eon so anything can happen between now and then but i think dole had a good chance of being elected because most americans are moderate and will go with the moderate candidate which is basically where clinton placed himself in the two elections he ran in most real democrats the warren beatties of the world and many congressmen and senators disliked clinton because they did not think he was democratic enough i like clinton because as i said over the years i have learned that extremes in either party do not get elected and that if you want someone that has your general interest at heart you have to find someone who is a moderate and can appeal to everybody i used to tell school districts when i went in to tell them how to put together a school levy campaign that basically you had the rule of 30s and that had nothing to do with my age but that there was about 30 of the people who were for you the yes votes 30 who were automatically against you the no votes and 30 in between i told them ignore the no votes just do not get them upset with you you do not want them working actively against you lock up your 30 that are with you make sure you do something with them but this group the middle 30s i called them you had to misogy them and that is what clinton did so well and that is what dole could have done i am not sure if george w is going to be able to because to get the nomination eventually he is going to come out and have to make his hard statements to those people which is i am antiabortion i am progun he is already said the progun and that is going against what most americans are saying dole i think represented where most americans are if you look at opinion polls so you know you have to find a way to moderate that stance whether you are republican or a democrat 

Recording: (5098/ 9621) 
yeah if i had stayed for the i did not graduate so if i would stayed for the fourth year when we did a lot would do a lot of making up a portfolio that kind of thing i probably then i would have started going to interviews and i probably would have stayed but it was

you 

Recording: (5118/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5119/ 9621) 
yeah i think the population in a way but i think it also leaves it open for all the things of having too many people in one area i do not know i think the main thing that affects me now and since i have been home i have been reading the paper a lot more and i am more aware of what is going on and i really am gonna be some kind of activist for i do not know a lot of the places that are coming up the gentleman is clubs and things like that i think that is going to be really bad for the kids and everybody around there is one off of bethel or no it is off of henderson cahoots and then there is the red hot peppers or something i saw the other day i can not even believe they are like right across the street from each other you know and it is funny because you read the paper and it seems like so many people are concerned about kids and education and all that but then they let all that stuff so i think it really affects it yeah try to go around and until they make a women is club so it will not be real equal 

Recording: (5120/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (5121/ 9621)

Recording: (5123/ 9621) 
so you have how many kids 

Recording: (5124/ 9621) 
we have been very happy with the osu daycare i do not know if you have any association with it but oh it is just unbelievable our daughter went there from six weeks all the way up to when she went to first grade and i mean when she got out of that daycare she could read she could write she could do computer you know it is an education it is not you know people you pay for it it is one of your hires but higher amount of money for 

Recording: (5125/ 9621)

yeah you are right 

Recording: (5127/ 9621) 
that is alright okay 

Recording: (5128/ 9621) 
it felt innocent to me and i like that because all the other times where they have started to kiss it is always been like stereotypic romantic da da da da da and that is like wow two friends alone it is new year is perfect it was not like they were gonna jump in the sack or anything like that 

Recording: (5129/ 9621) 
i do not know i mean i guess for me i just jason and i get along so well you know and we have been together for about two years and i mean i do not know i just i do i just really like him i do not know if i will feel that way in ten years from now but it certainly there is a lot of things that our families are very similar i mean we have a lot of the same types of opinions about different things and we communicate very well and i think those are a lot of things you have to look at from the beginning i know that i was in a relationship for about five years before i met him and his name was jason too but he drank a lot 

Recording: (5130/ 9621) 
that is true oh 

Recording: (5131/ 9621) 
oh really that is cute

Recording: (5133/ 9621) 
i got a lot of respect for the college kids the majority of them it is other people i do not have respect for 

Recording: (5134/ 9621) 
hmm 

Recording: (5135/ 9621) 
and oh she is snapping she is pregnant back off 

Recording: (5136/ 9621) 
oh no and it turns out it was the faceless aliens set a trap for the guys i did not like the way it was resolved but i liked the fact that it was not resolved the way that they set it up so i think that i mean we supposedly know about samantha 

Recording: (5137/ 9621) 
it is and it is not because i see where he is and he is really messed up and i can not do anything for him but i have you know i have i am open to a relationship with him

Recording: (5139/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5140/ 9621) 
you walk in and you are like oh my gosh do not you know the fire around that huh 

Recording: (5141/ 9621) 
okay well the reason i asked was it seems to me a lot of the impetus for going to church or going back to church for people is when their kid gets old enough to go to sunday school starting asking questions about religion and you are saying well i suppose i could answer all these but yeah 

Recording: (5142/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5143/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5144/ 9621) 
well and i think it really still goes back to the mom and the dad and what the kid thinks would make their mom and dad happy you know would i act this way would that make my mom and dad because until you are about five or four your parents are pretty important to you and what they think so that is when you know you have to instill that stuff you have to you know and they learn by watching you do it too i mean my son now i saw him when let us see he was 15 maybe he would run across the street when martha the 86yearold lady across the street was trying to bring her garbage down he would seen me do that he would go oh let me get that for you martha she is got arthritis she looks like she is gonna fall she takes steps about this big and i have seen him do that 

Recording: (5145/ 9621) 
you know with limited money and i live in a nice neighborhood i have lived there for 11 years i have never had any trouble whatsoever and the bus is right there you know the only thing that bothers me is if i want to you know go to a grocery store i got to go over to high street you know to clinton ville you know to the big bear 

Recording: (5146/ 9621) 
yeah you always still gonna have violence like when we were kids like me and you would meet we would get in a fight and then after that we would be best friends now you know i would be walking down the street and a 14yearold would scare me to death right now 

Recording: (5147/ 9621) 
before we used to have a system that only people in the back room of the libraries connected to and it was all mainframe and then people got pcs on their desk and suddenly the whole world of who could access any system and what they could do on their desk changed and now we have gone more out into the public what can the public see and do it is not just for the people in the back room and then the web you know people anybody anywhere can connect we only worked with libraries before now we are trying to figure out how do we deal with anybody who just wants to connect to us 

Recording: (5148/ 9621) 
i was actually looking at that riser military and they started popping up all this abuse stuff and i was like man darn it 

Recording: (5149/ 9621) 
yeah over the years we have had situations like that you know a pregnancy here and there things that people needed to get worked out or someone being worried about a neighbor being abused a child being abused and not knowing what to do about it so yeah but you know i am just lucky i am so lucky 

Recording: (5150/ 9621) 
i will also spend you 

Recording: (5151/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5152/ 9621)

Recording: (5153/ 9621) 
yeah i gave them to my sister and my mom and stuff like that 

Recording: (5154/ 9621) 
yeah i had a little gymnasium in it

aerospace industry my dad had a degree in engineering what kind of engineering drafting engineering i think and worked for in california and they asked him to move to the north american plant here in columbus out near the airport when it was north american before it became rockwell and that is why we moved here and that is why i grew up on the east side because it was close to there and when i was one year old we took a car trip across the country i do not remember much of it but that is how we moved 

Recording: (5159/ 9621) 
so now i am independent without family in columbus 

Recording: (5160/ 9621) 
wait even though it is an inanimate object it all kinda came together

and i would not be too opposed to do that myself if it would keep the cost down around here 

Recording: (5167/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (5168/ 9621) 
can get aggravating and when you get to be older you know some of those issues can be very aggravating 

Recording: (5169/ 9621) 
because they have enough money to buy new things and they do not want to necessarily send it down i do not think to the salvation army i think that they think that there is a better way of giving away and like goodwill they resell and salvation army they resell 

Recording: (5170/ 9621) 
um no which is i am very grateful he did like go past my parents house and things like that but then they moved here and even though it is public records like who owns a house luckily we have not had that because we purchased the house my husband and i before we were married and then moved in after we were married so the deed has my maiden name on it but no luckily

Recording: (5176/ 9621) 
all right 

Recording: (5177/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5178/ 9621) 
yeah and i think i am a firm believer that little subtleties like that to yourself are much better than looking in the mirror and going look at them hips and you go this way and you go i am getting a gut and you know it is like that is so negative to yourself would you tell your mom that 

Recording: (5179/ 9621) 
well we believe that that revelation that was there on earth was actually restored again through joseph smith because he had a desire in his heart to know what was true and he prayed and he actually had a vision where he saw god and jesus christ and i know this is all really i mean this is like deep doctrine stuff but and he was told that there were none of the churches on the earth were true that some of them had good things but they were not exactly hitting the mark 

Recording: (5180/ 9621) 
i 

Recording: (5181/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5182/ 9621)

Recording: (5187/ 9621) 
nah 

Recording: (5188/ 9621)

above it and periodically they would have to clean those out because the fan would draw in addition to fumes they would draw some lint off of this stuff so he was up on top of one of these rollers cleaning out the hood with supposedly nonflammable solvent 

Recording: (5193/ 9621) 
i have well that is a that is a tough one i remember when you know when we were we had you know some movies like that but they were like the bowery boys and stuff you know we are you pretty much knew it was all fake anyway you know but and to me that is fake and i never really thought about while i was growing up that it was what was real and everything i always knew that by i dare again you know by my dad being a hunter and everything you know i knew that when you shot something that died it would not it was not a game you know and i would hate to think that that would cause some kid to go off his rocker and shoot somebody else shoot another human being i mean that does not i do not even know why there should be any concern for it i guess on one side 

Recording: (5194/ 9621) 
bye 

Recording: (5195/ 9621) 
well i do not think that women should be on the front lines some women are physically able to do what is needed some definitely are not of course by the same token some men are not but as support groups i think that is all right 

Recording: (5196/ 9621) 
yeah i mean he 

Recording: (5197/ 9621) 
she is very bright she is very she comes from an extremely dysfunctional family her parents divorced when she was about four her mother is an alcoholic her father said he would take her with him and then after he got divorced he changed his mind so she is pretty much raised herself it is a big it is terrible things what she is had to go through and she is made it very clear that she will not live with an alcoholic and that that is helped straighten him out some and our feeling was never that the alcoholism or the drugs was not the problem and we have dealt with several counselors and that is all they wanted to deal with our problem has always been it is a symptom took the psychologist a year and a half but he finally agreed charlie he is very intuitive and even as a toddler he could do this he seemed to be able to give adults what they needed from him 

Recording: (5198/ 9621) 
that was real close to my home 

Recording: (5199/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5200/ 9621) 
but he would bring in a nutritionalist or whatever to explain to the parents blah blah blah 

Recording: (5201/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5202/ 9621) 
okay so it is just like an independent contractor for them 

Recording: (5203/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5204/ 9621) 
i think through education it is just going to only help kids because a lot of times maybe they do not get that at home so they are really looking to choose the right thing to do 

Recording: (5205/ 9621) 
yeah oh my uh i am in this uh venturing crew which is through boy scouts our leader has this like society totally planned out 

Recording: (5206/ 9621) 
back then i was working at a cycle shop but i was in the service while i was working there 

Recording: (5207/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5208/ 9621) 
crime and stuff i mean a lot of it is just a strong economy now that may have started during the republican years and carried over but people have been better off financially overall and i do not think he is made any major i would not say he is made any major mistakes policywise well yes his personal life he is made major mistakes policywise well yes his personal life just he is well yeah 

Recording: (5209/ 9621) 
i mean it goes back more towards the curious nature of kids where i mean i can not say there is anything really different 

Recording: (5210/ 9621) 
no that is 

Recording: (5211/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (5212/ 9621) 
i mean that is not to say that i do not like being catholic or whatever 

Recording: (5213/ 9621) 
it is just there we go again who is right who is wrong i have no idea 

Recording: (5214/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (5215/ 9621) 
but you had to work you had to migrate they started splitting the family up by saying sir if you want a job we are expanding to los angeles so they split the family up 

Recording: (5216/ 9621) 
yeah i think so i think in high school there was or maybe that was for the pregnant girls that were in our high school because there were pregnant girls in my high school 

Recording: (5217/ 9621) 
oh my goodness 

Recording: (5218/ 9621)

Recording: (5220/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (5221/ 9621) 
mm 

Recording: (5222/ 9621) 
it is like a mailorder catalog thing and uh so uh people are really really incompetent it is really funny like for some people uh i do not know how they had uh even some people who can speak english even one of our know how they got signed up for how they even have a credit card order and two you can tell especially when because people call from all over it is really funny to talk to people from alab south carolina i can never knew people from south carolina had such thick accents i never really thought of north carolina and south carolina being really southern even though i mean they seceded first you know i mean i just just that is different i always thought that more being east coast as opposed to so southern and man there is people people there who i can not even understand what they are saying and especially too how it is all like you have to give numbers and model numbers and stuff and type it in real fast and people go unbelievably fast when they say like a 10string number and then they get mad at you and like you can not type it in fast enough like if they just said it slow once it would save time and just how to how 3d8a and a bunch of numbers all sound the same like db38a all sound the same and people you know like a is an apple and they are like apple what what are you talking about something like that like for real weird and just how they are like where is my membership membership number and they can not find it and you are like all right all right look on the catalog where it says mem number that is that would be your membership number and people are like all right all right but i do not know like i really do not i really want to get a job that is like in a warehouse or something something real easy where i can just like load boxes or something because i never have time to really i mean like i try and do like can i try and do yoga but it is like we work to 3211 so it is like by the time you get home it is like you just want to sit and like not do anything and like you know working out is hard and stuff because you do not have time so i want to have a job where if i do not have time at the end of the day to work out it is like i am working out sort of during my job and i really hate talking on the phone now having jobs for a while where i talk on the phone makes me just not want to talk on the phone at all at home or too when i am on the phone at home then it brings weird flash flashbacks to work so it is like i will start like talking like i am at work you know so it is like like the phone like 

Recording: (5223/ 9621) 
yeah my dad is a chauvinist pig but that is he still is 

Recording: (5224/ 9621) 
but sisny is pretty much accessible 

Recording: (5225/ 9621) 
yeah well i asked the germans what stereotypes are prevalent in germany of americans and they said you know americans are cowboys and eat at mcdonald is three meals a day 

Recording: (5226/ 9621) 
i do not intend to ever leave here so 

Recording: (5227/ 9621) 
but i imagine your sibling has a similar worldview perhaps twisted in some 

Recording: (5228/ 9621) 
because i mean i have got a lot i have loved this man to death it is like and that might be something that was is holding me back from dating but you know it will eventually go away hopefully but yeah i would warn her i do not care if he is he looks like the perfect guy cause yeah i think he looks like he is a very nice guy and you know he just does not know how to stick with one woman i do not think yeah 

Recording: (5229/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (5230/ 9621) 
how to step by step of how to commit suicide yeah they have to be responsible i think because you know you put an idea into somebody is head and then when you give them the resources to carry those things out i think it has to be responsible for a lot of it 

Recording: (5231/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5232/ 9621) 
and i think that sometimes they do not even count all the votes or something and sometimes if they really wanted to go through bad enough even though the majority voted not for it i mean even though the majority does not want that to happen that somehow or other they will count it so it did or they will you know 

Recording: (5233/ 9621) 
if you just look at the nature of what they are doing it is just 

Recording: (5234/ 9621) 
i do not know if they still do that was a long time ago that is always kind of been known for that you know 

Recording: (5235/ 9621) 
the part now it takes about 50 minutes but to do all this stretching 

Recording: (5236/ 9621) 
right right 

Recording: (5237/ 9621) 
exactly 

Recording: (5238/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (5239/ 9621) 
i was just listening to music and i got a little sidetracked from this tree across the way it got destroyed by lightning i looked across and it started raining and the wind was a little heavy it was rocking me back and forth like this i got up all the way and looked around and said what the hell is going on here i turned on the radio and they said something about a thunderstorm coming through and it will be gone by 20 minutes or something this truck felt like it was going to tip over i got out of there real fast and started walking down towards it is probably about a good 20 mile walk to where the nearest 24 hour house of pancakes is you ever been down there the ihop 

Recording: (5240/ 9621)

Recording: (5305/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5306/ 9621)

Recording: (5307/ 9621) 
oh every day every day there was something it is like i felt like i knew more about clinton is sex life than i knew about my own and it was far more than i wanted to know about anybody else is whereas you know in the past there is been presidents who had a fear the press never acknowledged it even if they knew it at least that is what you know 

Recording: (5308/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (5309/ 9621) 
the government is always good for money 

Recording: (5310/ 9621)

Recording: (5312/ 9621) 
yeah i mean 

Recording: (5313/ 9621) 
or they use the bible to say well you know god specifically says in this chapter not to partake in spiritual activity well who do you think wrote that you know 

Recording: (5314/ 9621) 
and it was fun i met a lot of neat people in fact that is where i met the woman whose child i took care of she was one of the artists who came to me but nobody was going to make any money on it and it was the kind of thing that it was a project i started it when my youngest daughter started kindergarten because i needed a new project and i did not know anything about it i would never even been in a gallery i thought this will be fun i will just rent this space because i found this space and i was trying to think of something i could do with it so i thought well i will rent this space and then i know what i will do i will just put it out on the paper and i will find a bunch of artists and then i will set this business up and it was consignment so i did not need that money i just needed rent and we had art classes and that was fun and so once i got that whole thing all set up and all ready to go is not nearly as interesting once you know you i like i like to make it happen i am not really interested in just sitting there day after day waiting for somebody to come in and so when the lease was up on high street i was gonna get rid of it and a couple people came to me that were artists there and said could we please you know would you consider having some partners and i said sure if you guys are willing to come and sit in this place then i will have to come and sit here so we moved to grandview and it was doing much better over there and then the same thing happened the attorneys who were next door to us decided they wanted our space and when our lease was up they had more money than we did so we were going to have to move again and i just said this is not worth it and it and besides that i was ready that was about three or four years into it i was ready to do something else and i had already started taking care of jesse then so i used to take him down to the gallery with me i had a little bassinet in the back and people say is that a baby 

Recording: (5315/ 9621) 
it is open 24 hours so there is people that you know it is like shifts overlap you know it is not like everybody leaves and then everybody comes in you know it is like like when we are there like the night shift people start to come in people who work from like 8 to 4 8 pm to 4 am and that would be really weird i guess like nobody calls then or something like 10 people call so she is like it is so easy she is like i get paid to 

Recording: (5316/ 9621) 
hmm 

Recording: (5317/ 9621) 
i did not know what the problem was and i just kept having these problems with him so they told me i needed to take him to the school said i needed to take him to a psychiatrist psychologist so i took him and she said do you think this is normal because he is like rolling off the chair and banging dolls together i said i do not know i said i got one brother i do not know how boys are supposed to be she said well this is not normal okay so i do not know i tried taking him to psychologists they did like behavior therapy i brought him here to ohio state and put him in an experiment he was in it for about three years working with a food supplement and it actually did real well for him and the researcher gave me what he you know it is like sort of like taking vitamins he gave me supplies of that even after the project was over but then after there was not any more he could not give it to me and it cost too much for me to buy it 

Recording: (5318/ 9621) 
is it hard to keep up with her 

Recording: (5319/ 9621) 
ah they seem to 

Recording: (5320/ 9621) 
if you gotta pull tape over down the hall i will show you it is kinda 

Recording: (5321/ 9621) 
in a hole and i was still shaking but i do not remember i think they put one of our guns out of commission that time but they did not do as much damage as they might have 

Recording: (5322/ 9621) 
okay one two three four five testing testing when i was a kid my father got this tape recorder in the days when they were those big you know the wheels 

Recording: (5323/ 9621) 
yeah i would be so frustrated i probably oh i would be really 

Recording: (5324/ 9621) 
ha ha ha ha 

Recording: (5325/ 9621) 
leave it alone for hours like i did this morning but yeah 

Recording: (5326/ 9621) 
28 years this is my 28th year i have two more years to go and i get to retire and then i will go retrain and probably do something else for another 20 years 

Recording: (5327/ 9621) 
i can not see it 

Recording: (5328/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5329/ 9621) 
i worked downtown the last year i worked downtown and then i think about oh probably 1520 years ago i worked downtown and you know as far as the focus you mean like night time things or just anything in general 

Recording: (5330/ 9621) 
that is good 

Recording: (5331/ 9621) 
i would have a hard time believing that i mean if the person knew i would think if the person knew that people were praying for them at church and that was important to them and they prayed and 

Recording: (5332/ 9621) 
i feel that the past season the past two seasons really have not been as strong as the earlier seasons and so in some ways i am not as upset about the xfiles completing its run as i have been about other shows i mean it is also the simpsons final season i have heard 

Recording: (5333/ 9621) 
i might be wrong because my answer would not be that good on that question no offense but you know what i mean 

Recording: (5334/ 9621) 
the things that i notice that are different i guess i mean if you look like as far as expansion obviously there is a lot of areas that are developed now that did not used to be 

Recording: (5335/ 9621) 
i was ready to settle down i was not going for that stuff no more and he still wanted to do that and lie and cheat and make up stories and he still does it and i do not understand why i feel like he is a grown man if he was out do not make up a story and his mother also makes it is very stressful for me and that is another reason why i do not want my son going there for much longer but his dad pays her for the babysitting because i can not afford it 

Recording: (5336/ 9621) 
yeah yeah then they will not want to go anywhere with you anyways it is probably a pipe dream 

Recording: (5337/ 9621) 
mhm right 

Recording: (5338/ 9621) 
well i do not think he exaggerated but he was selective about the people that he 

Recording: (5339/ 9621) 
and the first episode the first half was excellent it had the cigarette smoking man it was from his perspective he was talking about it and then the second half got like 

Recording: (5340/ 9621) 
and to look at him and go oh my water broke oh no and watch him flip out like on movies but we did not get to do that 

Recording: (5341/ 9621) 
and most of the time they were putting them in charge well like we get no offense we get these college students coming out that were second lieutenants that thought they would know everything 

Recording: (5342/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5343/ 9621) 
i forgot you guys have like a big kangaroo population you know like ohio has like all these deer and stuff so it is like they have 

Recording: (5344/ 9621) 
yeah because it is all continuously mixed it is not real i like it how the rave scene is kind of faceless because it is not more rock star oriented and stuff it is more a serious type thing but not so glam and fame oriented and stuff 

Recording: (5345/ 9621) 
his my boyfriend is aunt and uncle their kid has that really hyperness 

Recording: (5346/ 9621) 
you know like if our system would shut down it would cost us i do not remember what it is you know tens of thousands of dollars for every hour that we are down if our database would be trashed our main database would be trashed we would have real serious problems and it could take weeks or months to rebuild it yeah so it could be a problem we have got people working in that area 

Recording: (5347/ 9621) 
you are still here 

Recording: (5348/ 9621) 
i like seeing them grow up together 

Recording: (5349/ 9621) 
which reminds me 

Recording: (5350/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5351/ 9621)

Recording: (5352/ 9621) 
winter of 91 and i went to columbus state and i had just there was a few years that i did not go here and then so i came back so all together i do not know how many years it is been but 

Recording: (5353/ 9621) 
a small one and i do not know whether it was there when we moved there or not but anyway it was a fairly good size i mean probably half a mile long and out in the middle of it there was an island 

Recording: (5354/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (5355/ 9621) 
you know like work hard when you have to 

Recording: (5356/ 9621) 
you know you got two adults in your house it does not matter what gender they are 

Recording: (5357/ 9621)

Recording: (5359/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5360/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5361/ 9621) 
really they are the biggest assholes 

Recording: (5362/ 9621) 
and the others were sort of good 

Recording: (5363/ 9621) 
yeah we are going to have to give it up by friday because the strike is over they will not let us keep it anymore 

Recording: (5364/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5365/ 9621) 
아쉽다 

Recording: (5366/ 9621) 
mmm 

Recording: (5367/ 9621) 
i am not built that way 

Recording: (5368/ 9621) 
oh there is a lot of racism 

Recording: (5369/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (5370/ 9621) 
you know okay this is what i am doing wrong let is not do it again and then nobody asked me out for a few more years 

Recording: (5371/ 9621) 
well the furniture the dining room sets the chairs the couches 

Recording: (5372/ 9621) 
oh no 

Recording: (5373/ 9621) 
they are gonna come and ask you something no matter what you say 

Recording: (5374/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5375/ 9621) 
now 

Recording: (5376/ 9621) 
and it was very hard for some of the younger people and students to get up there because of transportation 

Recording: (5377/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (5378/ 9621) 
so you knew you have heard about that probably 

Recording: (5379/ 9621) 
and you are not being recorded now 

Recording: (5380/ 9621) 
i never thought about that 

Recording: (5381/ 9621) 
i mean 

Recording: (5382/ 9621) 
professionalism as well 

Recording: (5383/ 9621) 
i play with computers normally when people ask me i tell them what i did that day or what i did the day before if they ask me in the evening so what did i do today what did i do today internet information server is a product by microsoft it lets you house web pages and put them out on the web indexserve is another product that lets you put search engines on that then there is another product by a company called splitcycle it is called netstock it sucks netstock basically goes out to yahoo and checks to see what the stock prices on something are and so i made netstock iis and index server all play nicely together today 

Recording: (5384/ 9621) 
that is it 

Recording: (5385/ 9621) 
that it should not be on the other hand i would hate to see a 13yearold have a baby because she was afraid 

Recording: (5386/ 9621) 
so we 

Recording: (5387/ 9621) 
i hear some of that from gor but not as much 

Recording: (5388/ 9621) 
it is a cartoon i believe it started out 

Recording: (5389/ 9621) 
oh there was a lot of discouraging things i mean i learned so much and it was not always just people rejecting you that was discouraging because that was kind of funny at times 

Recording: (5390/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (5391/ 9621) 
there were a couple that would go to raves every now and then and use it 

Recording: (5392/ 9621) 
against him in a lot of ways 

Recording: (5393/ 9621) 
of the times and memories and stuff 

Recording: (5394/ 9621) 
and that is where the ohio state players i do not know if you know this they stay there every night before a game i mean it is the most expensive hotel in columbus all the players stay there but to my amazement they come down for a i think they have a dinner then they come down for a midnight snack it is so funny how these guys come down in their shorts and stuff 

Recording: (5395/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5396/ 9621) 
i think that is kind of nice 

Recording: (5397/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (5398/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5399/ 9621) 
raised to love and 

Recording: (5400/ 9621) 
just like 

Recording: (5401/ 9621) 
about two and a half years ago 

Recording: (5402/ 9621) 
ha 

Recording: (5403/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5404/ 9621) 
in a heartbeat try and help them but i do not think they make an effort to put out any you know 

Recording: (5405/ 9621) 
the majority of the ones that do not get the guidance at home that you are trying to reach ai not gonna go to boy scouts 

Recording: (5406/ 9621) 
they have a very nice standard of living all of them do 

Recording: (5407/ 9621) 
and so they offered to move them back 

Recording: (5408/ 9621) 
people like that can not work when i was a kid your family took care of you there was not welfare and stuff like this but you do not have a family structure no more 

Recording: (5409/ 9621) 
a parakeet yes a little two and a half three ounce ball of fluff 

Recording: (5410/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5411/ 9621) 
and then i will start running this campaign then i will kind of read up on it but i have not really 

Recording: (5412/ 9621) 
oh yeah and that is normal we understood that we knew a lot of stuff we raised him to be very independent and i always said that we are gonna regret this someday i said another 10 years we will be pleased but we were not particularly raised either of us my wife or i to be very independent so i guess the point that when we were first married it was hard to make a simple decision on anything you know we have worked through that after 25 years but or to stand on our own or anything but you know we learned to do it but we always he was always very independent his teacher said independently said stubborn but it is like even go to mcdonald is or something and he was did not want onions on anything he if he ordered a happy meal without onions and they put onions on it he would go up to the counter even as six and seven years old and tell him 

Recording: (5413/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5414/ 9621) 
oh my gosh they just 

Recording: (5415/ 9621) 
nope i met him through a friend i met him through his brother was dating my best friend 

Recording: (5416/ 9621) 
yeah he is really good 

Recording: (5417/ 9621) 
i think it would 

Recording: (5418/ 9621) 
yes and that is what i like 

Recording: (5419/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5420/ 9621) 
hit the mark sometimes so he gets to clean the toilet especially since most of that is his 

Recording: (5421/ 9621) 
anything else is a hardware failure and you would have to go fix it somewhere else anyway so if you know how to put an operating system on your machine you can start over if you can start over there is no reason to be scared of anything that you do problem number one in playing with computers for most people is being afraid that they are going to break something 

Recording: (5422/ 9621) 
well believe me i know 

Recording: (5423/ 9621) 
yeah you can hide a lot of that and get away with it for a long time which i am sure she did i do not know i always thought it would be neat to have a system like the police have if you do not pay a speeding ticket there is a warrant for your arrest and they come after you 

Recording: (5424/ 9621) 
like catholic oh for mormons well our basic real fundamental belief is that the church that the russians believed in at one time was the true church and that it was the same church that christ set up when he was on the earth with the 12 apostles but after christ died that the authority was taken from the earth to have those apostles and to have the church set up like it was and it must have been really strong because it still lasted all the same catholic and all the orthodox churches still carried all these beliefs 

Recording: (5425/ 9621) 
no children so it was quite easy for us 

Recording: (5426/ 9621) 
yeah not for special conditions nothing just universally it is wrong 

Recording: (5427/ 9621) 
i would do it in a minute but my family does not want it my husband thinks we are fine he does not want any more around and all my kids are so used to all their own 

Recording: (5428/ 9621) 
and until that consumer becomes on equal knowledge level as the market it is always gonna be inequitable and you are gonna have a problem in our society because we do not need these large houses and so forth because as you progress in age it becomes a liability but then the developers are like well let us see we can make condos downsize a little bit but still we wanna make this margin of profit yeah we do but what about for society is best interests 

Recording: (5429/ 9621) 
yeah that is true that is a pretty good analogy 

Recording: (5430/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5431/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5432/ 9621) 
yeah it is but see i have always i have one floors where i live now i vacuum them i mean i am just the type you know i did not want pet hair and 

Recording: (5433/ 9621) 
but yeah i am disciplined she is not as strict as i am 

Recording: (5434/ 9621) 
i do not know i do not know i am sure it would happen because there is all kinds of wacky people out there seriously i do not know i have family members that are homosexual that is just my own personal thing beliefs i do not know i think that is they should not have taken it off of the dms whatever it was i do not know 

Recording: (5435/ 9621) 
yeah you follow the script that is real funny too they listen to you they monitor the calls and they listen to you and it is like this sheet if you asked for the specials and if you said it in this way and if you used this or whatever i do not know it is just real weird 

Recording: (5436/ 9621) 
oh i know it is so much fun 

Recording: (5437/ 9621) 
aw 

Recording: (5438/ 9621) 
it is just like the people you see go to church i walk out of church and see somebody sitting there that is homeless 

Recording: (5439/ 9621) 
gay people are straight people so 

Recording: (5440/ 9621) 
yeah when i first went to oberlin i was a performance major in french horn and looking back on it i wish i had maybe thought to major in music education or at least have a little bit of background in that because i am thinking it would have given me a little more dimension in terms of my teaching possibilities and although i am certified to teach now in chemistry and earth science it might be nice to have the option of teaching music also 

Recording: (5441/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5442/ 9621) 
right yeah 

Recording: (5443/ 9621) 
mmhmm i just got done doing some roofing and i was supposed to meet my girlfriend out there she never did show up so i had to walk from incredible we are incredible universities to be will just say hilliard and 270 all the way back this way on campus without water oh man talk about being stuck in a desert 

Recording: (5444/ 9621) 
just a home i just have a tape that i use it is kathy smith one of her things that i really like 

Recording: (5445/ 9621) 
i answered it right 

Recording: (5446/ 9621) 
person on she is pretty high up i guess i was unaware 

Recording: (5447/ 9621) 
but i managed to get that much information out so the other cop goes upstairs and chris is interpretation of the story at this point is one moment i am cheerfully playing on the computer and the next moment i turn around and there is a large police officer in the doorway of your room he said hi he said i think you should come downstairs they do not tell chris anything so chris comes downstairs and he stands beside me 

Recording: (5448/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5449/ 9621) 
んん 

Recording: (5450/ 9621) 
i do not argue with them i do not debate it it is just like it might 

Recording: (5451/ 9621) 
and being able to meet them quicker and more effectively i think so yeah i have a lot of friends from other countries oh yeah and with their children the types of parenting you do with your children a lot of mainstream americans look at them like that is so weird like breastfeeding until the child is like two or three years old is a fairly common thing in other countries here it is just like people look at it like a little kid i know that is another thing i forgot to mention exactly just from family yeah oh yeah really because i thought that meant my motherinlaw you know if it is not necessary to say it then it is necessary not to say it so it is just kind of in your home type of thing and you do not really go around saying yeah we sleep in the same bed and we breastfeed still and you just kind of they ask you like yeah well yeah that is just the way we are doing it so 

Recording: (5452/ 9621) 
no to live off campus after my class it will be 22 and senior credit status but my class was 21 or senior credit so i got to move off campus but had i been a year younger i would not have been able to because i have to wait until 22 

Recording: (5453/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5454/ 9621) 
yeah i start early and she starts late so she gets the one daughter on the bus to go to school and then she can take the boy over to the daycare and then they are only there five hours or so 

Recording: (5455/ 9621) 
yeah and i am closer to the ones that feel the same way i do about things my oldest sister you know i could stay on the phone so long but we have such different opinions about things that yeah i do not stay on very long with her 

Recording: (5456/ 9621) 
and well the people that own it are starting to build it up now but it is been like that it was the first apartment community in columbus it was built in 38 i guess 

Recording: (5457/ 9621) 
i am so sorry 

Recording: (5458/ 9621) 
hmm 

Recording: (5459/ 9621) 
or some kind of tax program 

Recording: (5460/ 9621) 
no it is kind of like you go to a private school and you get there maybe seven years old on up to 15 16 and at 16 they can actually determine give you a test and sit down with you and ask you about different things and 16 15 16 year old could actually graduate from college yeah they have showed that study already i mean i think it is amazing yeah i mean when i first heard about it i said eh some doogie howser shit but now it is just now it is kind of reality you know because i know pretty much a lot of skilled trades i know how to cook pretty much know how to handle myself out in the wilderness i mean you know go up on nature hikes and go fishing all that stuff just combines into one it is all about being an individual and if those teachers can not study with that individual know what that individual wants young then older kids not gonna know what to do end up practicing law and not liking it going all that school for it 

Recording: (5461/ 9621) 
yes but it was interesting they did have assemblies where they had religious assemblies religion was not all invasive in this school but they did have assemblies for religious holidays and that kind of thing and i remember thinking it is interesting that the concept of eating somebody is flesh and blood it is almost cultlike and i am thinking i am starting to think well what really separates a religion from a cult and i think it is just the social acceptance of it really almost you know how many people are in it probably what number divides them i am not really sure yeah yeah yeah well i like i was i have been very politically active at various times in my past and especially i guess in the late 70s and early 80s i was very active in alternative energy fighting against nuclear power and i have been active at various times in animal rights movements and political campaigns foreign policy kinds of debates that kind of thing and one thing that i have noticed a lot is there are a lot of well there is a wide spectrum but there are a lot of liberals in the catholic church too 

Recording: (5462/ 9621) 
we were floating around just did not know if they were going to send us in or not because it was toward the end of it 

Recording: (5463/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5464/ 9621) 
now 

Recording: (5465/ 9621) 
mhm 

Recording: (5466/ 9621) 
i am a spanish major 

Recording: (5467/ 9621) 
is funny to have people care people apologize to you and when they are done with ever and it is like they care so much about somebody that they are talking to you on the phone for like five minutes uh it is for people sometimes ask me like where where we are atomic homicide uh taxes away from from uh new jersey she is like twenty or something for for a long time she was she was real funny just uh how how accents are in philly she would say like horrible and saying numbers like like nine and or kind of like an east coast accent it was real funny and she was just asking me like what it looks like in our building you know that is always funny to you know you call people from the phone you do not know what they look like you do not know what the other person looks like and what the building is set up like it is interesting 

Recording: (5468/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5469/ 9621) 
they are liking it small town living out in the country raising the kids big house huge yard dog we keep looking and saying now how is this different or better for the kids 

Recording: (5470/ 9621) 
yeah i like football and pool 

Recording: (5471/ 9621) 
and these guys have a free ride and then they just leave on it 

Recording: (5472/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5473/ 9621) 
they are like three times more price wise 

Recording: (5474/ 9621) 
and just keep an eye on what is going on 

Recording: (5475/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5476/ 9621) 
but the writing they give you one point for each paragraph so you have to get five points to pass now you might get four out of five and almost pass and then you have to retake that one part 

Recording: (5477/ 9621) 
yeah you have to concentrate on what is important or it just flies by and you do not even see it yeah 

Recording: (5478/ 9621) 
and the other one is a working cuff at the steubenville ohio 

Recording: (5479/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5480/ 9621) 
yeah i grew up in columbus i was born here i went to osu for school i was an undergrad 

Recording: (5481/ 9621) 
yeah i did and then she was kind of a gossip she went around talking to everybody trying to get them all support nobody would support her 

Recording: (5482/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (5483/ 9621) 
you know he is paying rent and his mother was not really his motherinlaw but her so she can right he has become more responsible about a lot of things which is again a normal maturation but he is just doing it the hard way 

Recording: (5484/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5485/ 9621) 
the rail service no 

Recording: (5486/ 9621) 
well and do not you think too that the more they have found out psychologically speaking about children and the placement of children in the family and the throes of not having enough or being sorely neglected because you were one of so many i mean janet and i both know that experience from being one of 11 children raised so you know you did not have the advantages 

Recording: (5487/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5488/ 9621) 
well i did not know if you would give them my name or yeah there is a variety of places yeah i could give your name to the main secretary if you can 

Recording: (5489/ 9621) 
whatever his name is arnold schwarzenegger he is into his kind of movies i like sixth sense i love that movie 

Recording: (5490/ 9621) 
hmm 

Recording: (5491/ 9621) 
switch kids 

Recording: (5492/ 9621) 
probably 

Recording: (5493/ 9621) 
i was about to say now on the record or off the record 

Recording: (5494/ 9621) 
i am from columbus ohio i was born and raised in columbus i grew up on the east side of columbus i graduated from high school i then started working for ohio state in 1977 and have been here for 24 years 

Recording: (5495/ 9621) 
yeah they are 

Recording: (5496/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5497/ 9621) 
and that is what a lot of people are telling me you know just you know life is a struggle 

Recording: (5498/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5499/ 9621) 
it was not easy at first it was probably a lot harder than after you have been there for about six months and you start to just get used to things but i took for granted coming back here 

Recording: (5500/ 9621) 
because the son at five already plays all these adding games and subtraction games and letter games and at least the daycare all the stuff they have on their computer is all education stuff it is not game game it has a game theme to it 

Recording: (5501/ 9621) 
videos 

Recording: (5502/ 9621) 
i think that it would have been better for me if we had lived in new york 

Recording: (5503/ 9621) 
boy it would have to be something that i actually enjoy what happened was ever since i came to columbus almost every company i worked for was bought out and sold and moved to a different state and i was not interested in that because my husband works for the state so obviously he is not going anywhere so i got tired of that and that is why i kind of went to temping and stuff so it would be one with a variety i am unfortunately i say unfortunately good at accounting and stuff but that does not get to express my creative side as much so it would be my favorite job was one where i did the accounting but i dealt with people as well and like would do presentations at seminars and stuff like that occasionally too so right 

Recording: (5504/ 9621) 
and it is you know my mom you know she always said well what do you think i should do about this and we always talk about different things so i think it is kind of neat that i have been involved in a lot of the other kids that way 

Recording: (5505/ 9621) 
at our desk we had terminals that connected to a system 

Recording: (5506/ 9621) 
no i just like it anyway i like their culture a lot 

Recording: (5507/ 9621) 
fruit loops yeah and it is like what is the difference you know besides the price 

Recording: (5508/ 9621) 
but there are those that are out there that are willing to do that 

Recording: (5509/ 9621) 
they should not know where the keys are if there were keys to the gun cabinet or whatever i mean the fact that how do you explain your way out of your kids taking guns to school 

Recording: (5510/ 9621) 
which was scheduled in the evenings when i was working and i could not even go to therapy 

Recording: (5511/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (5512/ 9621) 
oxlux is probably the closest place 

Recording: (5513/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (5514/ 9621) 
i am not going to do that 

Recording: (5515/ 9621) 
my boyfriend would love to mess with this i just want you to know that he would be like ee ee ee taking it apart putting it back together 

Recording: (5516/ 9621) 
according to that and so i can not think what some of their observations were but there is usually just one or two lines of 

Recording: (5517/ 9621) 
she that is a grandmother she lets the kids pretty much you know 

Recording: (5518/ 9621) 
they go she is got it and they go on to the next guy and then all of a sudden you are going off this way and they go so tonight juliet where are you going and you are like he told me to and then they go oh brother so now the attention is diverted to you so that is usually what the problem is because most pilots are there real professional 

Recording: (5519/ 9621) 
i have given you plenty of opinions have not i i have just loaded them on you okay i just have a question is this a research project for a private organization or is it 

Recording: (5520/ 9621) 
you know what my parents never did because they knew i was always levelheaded i always had a lot of boyfriends you know but i always felt like i was waiting for the right one 

Recording: (5521/ 9621) 
is that right 

Recording: (5522/ 9621) 
instead of a doctor 

Recording: (5523/ 9621) 
hmm 

Recording: (5524/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5525/ 9621) 
like i said i have been here 25 years i have seen a lot of weird stuff fact is when i was a baker i seen a manager that had nothing to do for 10 years 

Recording: (5526/ 9621) 
from the day one 

Recording: (5527/ 9621) 
yes but that has primarily because of necessity more often than not maybe even today it is less than that because it is been because of a loss of a parent or inability of a parent or parents being able to handle those children so yes those things do exist and they will always have some but that is a very small percentage though scott 

Recording: (5528/ 9621) 
it does not matter how much money they are given for their education 

Recording: (5529/ 9621) 
when you think that our major resource is our children and our offspring then we better not you know 

Recording: (5530/ 9621) 
we are planning on moving in the spring 

Recording: (5531/ 9621) 
well number one it is a little bit smaller more controlled area quiet no less and get my mom closer to the sister my sister lives up there she moved there from down in west virginia so with mom having all the peace and quiet she wants plus in a place that is only a year old 

Recording: (5532/ 9621) 
sure 

Recording: (5533/ 9621) 
just to get into the school there is about 30 people applying they let three in 

Recording: (5534/ 9621) 
ia hai 

Recording: (5535/ 9621) 
yes to some degree they should but there we go again it is just like the people when i worked in bars they would always want to hold the bartender responsible but say you could come up i would give you a beer and you could give it to somebody else 

Recording: (5536/ 9621) 
all the cool apartments are on 161 all the great restaurants and everything so that is where i lived 

Recording: (5537/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5538/ 9621) 
well actually it is sort of all happening in a certain area you know with you know very high unemployment like council council estates you know this sort of stereotype you know kind of bad family environment you know parents have loads of boyfriends and girlfriends drugs everything else and you know a lot of these girls that have been interviewed you know say oh you know i wanted something to love or you know we were bored so we decided to have sex and i mean i find it just totally appalling and you know a 13 year old boy who was interviewed was saying oh you know he you know slept with like like 10 girls or something and i am thinking oh my gosh you know and he is 13 and you know had a few kids and that was it but in my opinion the main problem there is they get more support even at that age when they have they you know they get unemployment because once they have had a kid even if they are not of working age they get a certain amount of money and then once they reach i think 15 or 16 if they have a baby they are the top of the list for a council house so they get their own there was actually a long documentary on before i left of this girl who was constantly fighting with her parents and her parents were at the end of their rope she got pregnant and she was like well hey this is my ticket to move out because she gets her own place she gets money for herself money for the baby she does not have to pay any utilities or anything and what more could she want was basically what basically what she was saying i have got my own place i can do whatever i want i am getting money and i do not have to work and and so that i think is a very bad situation because they are almost rewarded for you know 

Recording: (5539/ 9621) 
rise 

Recording: (5540/ 9621) 
because i had a lot of frustration build up what is next get a whole list there 

Recording: (5541/ 9621) 
so they built one out in hilliard 

Recording: (5542/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5543/ 9621) 
know and without health insurance that will cost a few hundred dollars and they have no means to help themselves at least if you assuming you were 18 you could get a job like and try and pay for your health insurance i mean i am not saying it would be easy but still 

Recording: (5544/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5545/ 9621) 
yeah and then you can stay as long as you want you do not you know feel obligated and everybody just brings in food you know everybody brings their own stuff and it is fun i mean yeah it is from thanksgiving to christmas i mean it is just nonstop family everywhere so it is fun 

Recording: (5546/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (5547/ 9621) 
hmm where from 

Recording: (5548/ 9621) 
yeah she is got a lot of kids there is three boys and like four girls 

Recording: (5549/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5550/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5551/ 9621) 
now 

Recording: (5552/ 9621) 
i guess i like to do it but i probably i do not know 

Recording: (5553/ 9621) 
they are five hours from colorado so they still badlands are not too far away and i guess it is like 900 miles from here so they can still drive back they come at least once twice a year back to ohio 

Recording: (5554/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5555/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (5556/ 9621) 
thing at first but she loves my kids and she loves my husband 

Recording: (5557/ 9621) 
sometimes people just go on and on about things like i got a or like they have like some like insane problem like i do not know why they are sharing it with me like you know like i had to get this you know i had to get this chair cuz my brotherinlaw yeah he sat on it and broke it man i got a fight with him about it yeah his wife and blah blah going on and on about it it is like like yep like his wife is a bitch or something i do not know i do not know what they expect me to say or like i talked to this one guy he was a navy seal and he did like a couple tours in vietnam and he was talking about how he was drunk and he was from alabama and he was like yeah i am about half drunk now so i am trying to figure out where his model number is and like i do not know we talked to him for like 15 minutes 

Recording: (5558/ 9621) 
bye 

Recording: (5559/ 9621) 
i am serious 

Recording: (5560/ 9621) 
yeah she went down to western missouri 

Recording: (5561/ 9621) 
no no in fact the principal when she interviewed me asked me that and i said when we are raised in the unitarian sunday school it is almost an indoctrination and tolerance for other religions so you are better off with me than somebody that believes theirs is the only one true religion 

Recording: (5562/ 9621) 
the gossip i heard was that the superintendent of schools said that if he was reelected she was going to resign and so they gave her a big raise he must be a thorn in her side 

Recording: (5563/ 9621) 
yeah well people do not have the priorities that they should what do you do you work all your life and you make a lot of money and then you die what did you do did you learn anything did you teach anyone did you have an opinion about anything that to me if you do not have time then you are just floating along trying to take it up space 

Recording: (5564/ 9621) 
there is like two people who are like from the i mean they are not old but they are like from the 40s and they have bought generators they bought water they have got extra food they have got a freeze extra freezers they bought ammunition it is like hello you know i just think it is 

Recording: (5565/ 9621) 
they yeah well the grandmother she says she is a christian but i do not see it i mean a lot of people claim they are something and you know which i might not be a total christian because i do not do all the right things but i do believe in god i do believe i am going to go to heaven i try not to you know sin too much and i do pray to him and i you know i just i do not go to church like i used to go to church all when i was growing up now i feel like you do not have to go to church to believe in god and all that i talk to him i talk to my grandparents that are in heaven that is just what i was raised as 

Recording: (5566/ 9621) 
i think in spanish here they had two murders over there and it was publicized in the columbus area 

Recording: (5567/ 9621) 
sure 

Recording: (5568/ 9621) 
and they might be something as easy as what are the three colors in our flag or how much do you have to have of the senate to pass a law it could be something real real technical or something that a threeyearold can answer because it is trying to hit all the areas that you have learned 

Recording: (5569/ 9621) 
but most of the vegetables are available truly the zucchini you will find your green peppers smaller i got a cucumber the other day and usually they are so big and i tell you i do not think it was that long 

Recording: (5570/ 9621) 
pray 

Recording: (5571/ 9621) 
i mean obviously that is a long ways off i guess i imagine i would be teaching in public school so hopefully i could try to get them where i was but i do not know i mean maybe i do not know i do not even know if it is dublin really better than columbus public 

Recording: (5572/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5573/ 9621) 
yeah well he thinks he can do it 

Recording: (5574/ 9621) 
well the coach he is pretty much got it all together he just needs to put everybody in their own separate category instead of having one person for one part of the team and another person for another part of the team 

Recording: (5575/ 9621) 
yes yeah that is right you can not get a seat there 

Recording: (5576/ 9621) 
you are right on the top 

Recording: (5577/ 9621) 
they would heard it all before and some of them had known me for a few years i was told after i retired that she was actually easier to get along with when i was there than anyone else i do not believe that yeah 

Recording: (5578/ 9621) 
ok well just call me rachel and i am 24 i have got a twoyearold son he is just had his birthday the 31st and i live by myself in a house and i work in the accounting department 

Recording: (5579/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (5580/ 9621) 
may be kind of hard in a that she gets into an engineering tech program because she has not had all the math prerequisites because she just did not stay in school long enough 

Recording: (5581/ 9621) 
so what kind of example is he setting for everybody else 

Recording: (5582/ 9621) 
i made a difference 

Recording: (5583/ 9621) 
no offense it is easier on a dry call up 

Recording: (5584/ 9621) 
oh bro 

Recording: (5585/ 9621) 
he talks about biting even though he is never bit and there is one particular boy right now when his family leaves he just has complete temper tantrums and he is tried that out a few times too he is one you can leave and it does not phase him he is very comfortable with other people but like the last month or so he is tried that a few times and i think he picked that up at daycare seeing the other kids do that 

Recording: (5586/ 9621) 
i mean there are split seconds where you just want to shoot somebody unfortunately anybody says that i mean i am i do not even like stepping on ants but there is those moments where you are like 

Recording: (5587/ 9621) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (5588/ 9621) 
well i do not know if it is monroe county or 

Recording: (5589/ 9621) 
oh yeah i think everybody should have if nothing else you missed the boat by that time 

Recording: (5590/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5591/ 9621) 
i guess it is just over the course of the year everything balances out you know 

Recording: (5592/ 9621) 
damn

yeah i went to columbus public schools always over on the west side same area of town always lived there i live there now came up here to osu got my bachelor is in english lit and then went to case western reserve for a master is then i decided i wanted to go somewhere else in the country which i got my library degree and the only job i could find was here in columbus 

Recording: (5601/ 9621) 
but i think one of the things that you see people do a lot that really bothers me is that whole thing about 

Recording: (5602/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5603/ 9621) 
yeah i know i think too i apologize to my oldest daughter almost every day about the poor thing all i put her through when we were trying to grow up together and i was 24 when she was born so i was not a child but it is like you do not have realistic expectations of what children are capable of or what they can do because if they are really verbal my kids always have been really verbal because i have talked to them from the moment they were born even when they could not talk to me that was irrelevant i was talking to them the whole time so i would talk to them the whole time so they would always be very verbal it seemed like they had a much better understanding and could do things better than they really could when my daughter was about five we got a hamster i said you know you make sure you give it food and water and when it died i was so surprised that she had not given it been giving it food and water because she did it occasionally but to a fiveyearold you do not yeah they do not get that stuff together or when she was 11 we sold her bedroom furniture and i gave her the money to keep so she could wait to buy something else well within three or four months it was gone know and so then the next year and a half she only had a mattress on the floor in her room because but i mean all that was bizarre now with my other kids first of all i would have better sense than to do those things i would take more responsibility rather than expecting them to have it and secondly 

Recording: (5604/ 9621) 
anyway you know so just simply living

well i will be honest i have a lot of homosexual friends and being in the restaurant business and growing up in the restaurant business and that is how i really kind of met him when i was going to school i did not know any and i went to ou and honestly down there i did not know i did not know anybody was gay i feel that a lot of people or i will say most of them or all of them are born that way some of them do make a choice but i feel that it should be talked about in school for so long it was in the closet they did not talk about it and these kids had to hide it and i just think in today is world and there is so many people that that are openly gay that it should be talked about more in school i do i think you know especially i just think some and women there is women that you know i had my gym teacher in brookhaven now that i look at it i did not know then but she was gay i mean we did not i did not think that then i do not know why but she was very manly but she was very she was very good but she was you know just not feminine at all

Recording: (5611/ 9621)

Recording: (5616/ 9621) 
so the way the university here is run i can not agree with most of the stuff they do 

Recording: (5617/ 9621)

then you submit a portfolio in the fall for review and they decide which students are good enough to be in the department 

Recording: (5628/ 9621) 
so you know now that is just like they consider that like urban 

Recording: (5629/ 9621) 
just employers need to be employers just need to do that on their own and it is tough to be able to trust a business like that but it is a private business they need to be able to 

Recording: (5630/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5631/ 9621) 
lassie i think i could summarize just with a few words of what you are meaning to say may be wrong but i think you are really meaning to say we must get back to the family there must be two parents and they must recognize their children and do like you have just discussed do with them and because today we are just drifting and drifting and drifting 50 of everyone who marries has divorced within a matter of about five years as i understand the statistics today unfortunately it is still increasing but there is a strong feeling that maybe this is going to slowly reverse or at least decrease not reverse probably once again we are talking about communications too and the communications can be ill and they can be great as she is touched upon but i feel that pendulum has to swing back from the nonfamily we are headed toward or have been headed toward and get back to a very basic family orientation it is abhorrent when i hear that what was it seven ladies who were quote beautiful ladies are now willing to sell their sperm well it is not their sperm whatever it is they sell for $10000 a piece to be implanted in another so that they can produce a quote beautiful child well a beautiful child and if you are talking about just the physical features is meaningless it is what is embodied in that body that can be beautiful instead of just the physical features that you look at and that to me is abhorrent such an idea and that indeed is going to take away from family in my way of thinking i can not imagine that i would have my wife producing somebody else is child over here and i am going to have the same thank you that is exactly fatherly love fatherly value fatherly instincts toward or with that child

Recording: (5653/ 9621) 
usually every weekend 

Recording: (5654/ 9621)

i have always been into art in high school i went to art like a ball and i was for fine arts and i have always wanted to do art because i can not do anything else no it is mostly i am not good at math i mean i could probably major in english or something like that but not math this is the talent my husband is good at math so that is where i go i am grateful for that 

Recording: (5662/ 9621) 
we are not going to make as much money the people are going to say gee i am not going to them i am going to go someplace else again it gets back to weaknesses in our standards in our society we care less about anybody else we do not hey if i have problems the government is going to help me out that is a mindset that is been entrenched for 40 some years it is a mindset that if you talk to the older generations that are dying off now that said we would never have had in our lifetime it is a rule nation in our country and if you are old enough to remember khrushchev i believe khrushchev is right we will bury you we will bury you internally in other words we will break you up you will separate internally you have dysfunctional people we are dysfunctional families if you ever work on pastoral care activity you will find out that people are so concerned about their families they fail they think because their family is broken up they have got single parents here they got divorced here they do not know what is going on they are on drugs well the problem is we never got involved as you said business we make more time you know there is more time spent for soccer on sunday than going to church you talk about they said was it meet the press quote i think slogan is a day without me the sunday about me to press you know david was it so like sunday is not a sunday about me to press well hey that just tells you right there where our thoughts are we are only thinking of ourselves i will guarantee it as you get older you start thinking a little differently and i think as you talk you should be talking to some older people i am saying people in the in their 80s define how the progression of life is and how you think because when you go to estate sales all you are talking about this is profit motive you are sitting on the lawns the quality of life is in the mind of the person you avoid it all the time 

Recording: (5663/ 9621) 
yes and no when we were in boy scouts we got kicked out of it

Recording: (5670/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (5671/ 9621) 
i think that with all the violence in the schools and that sort of thing i think people are starting to look at it a little differently 

Recording: (5672/ 9621) 
transportation issue i thought that rail system looked kind of cool which is kind of tough the question is do we want to spend the money on it and would people actually use it i think a lot of it goes back down to traffic and you are looking at people driving both ways and i think if people are actually going to make it so people are actually going to use it i think it would probably be a pretty good thing to have and i voted for it i can not believe you are going to do that 

Recording: (5673/ 9621) 
you know so 

Recording: (5674/ 9621) 
exactly 

Recording: (5675/ 9621) 
but i do not see it as negatively affecting me i still get all the stuff done i need to get done 

Recording: (5676/ 9621) 
yeah from the strike yeah actually a lot of our stuff did pretty well while we were off so it did not make you feel as needed as you wanted to be yeah we got a lot of our buildings up and running before they went on strike and i think the bosses knew this was coming so a lot of the air conditioning was already running by then

Recording: (5700/ 9621) 
you have the option to take your bed down i had to take mine down because i broke my ankle fall quarter

Recording: (5713/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5714/ 9621) 
scary okay and it was funny because you see the cops first but in reality the cops are behind two other people that i actually know but it does not matter because you always see cops first so the two other people that i actually know are my stepmother is parents stepmother and father have been split up for i do not know a month or two now they have been married for something like six months now and my sister and i both wanted to tell her ahead of time that she was making a horrible mistake but she would not have listened to us so we did not bother telling her 

Recording: (5715/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5716/ 9621) 
and i mean i do not think a lot of people have ever heard of ecstasy until that movie 

Recording: (5717/ 9621) 
how long have you been here 

Recording: (5718/ 9621) 
i had the same thing happen to my kid i smacked him one time 

Recording: (5719/ 9621) 
professors and everything but i think you know they get a lot of these kids and they do not care about school but they leave early because they know they can do it 

Recording: (5720/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5721/ 9621)

Recording: (5722/ 9621)

he does a lot of maintenance he was doing drywall before this i kind of wish he stuck with that 

Recording: (5725/ 9621) 
moss bill moss he is always saying oh this is racist and that is racist but i do not think it is too bad in columbus i know there are places lots worse like the south and so on of course who really knows the race issue is such a big question 

Recording: (5726/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5727/ 9621) 
is not that amazing 

Recording: (5728/ 9621) 
oh yeah yeah 

Recording: (5729/ 9621) 
but i am not sure how it is going to work osu is website is under construction i was like whoa darn it so then my aunt works here and all my cousins most of them graduated here so i kind of want to follow them go with the flow but i did some other ones emailed and if you have this program can you tell me something about it and it was actually i think with students met for the first time at their graduation they finished their whole college on the internet i said well that would be very easy for me and i could do it at my convenience like when he is asleep i can go and do that i think it would make it a lot easier to get up getting up is a very hard task very big bags like i can not see 

Recording: (5730/ 9621) 
i do not know this freedom semiquasifreedom there is an illusion of freedom and a reality of freedom and the indian people know the big difference of that 

Recording: (5731/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5732/ 9621) 
yeah so or how hard can it be to say to a student if you have a student with an adiq for example and you know he is not going to get all the details and the battles and the years and the captain is names but you just want him to get the overall gist of the french and american war was about this time in history and this was the result and this is how long it lasted just the main concepts well there is the kid that you say todd you study for the test and when you come in i will let you answer anything on the test you know and anything you do not know you leave blank and i will just grade what you put down 

Recording: (5733/ 9621) 
i know 

Recording: (5734/ 9621) 
the government yeah the government mayors but then look at them i mean there is another example well yeah i mean so that is not the case but it is a man too i mean i think women would be more efficient and they would see those things because we have had to live with them forever even g movies that little kids are going to see if there is a woman in there 

Recording: (5735/ 9621) 
i 

Recording: (5736/ 9621) 
oh really 

Recording: (5737/ 9621) 
it is very informal here so i do not know what we were doing but 

Recording: (5738/ 9621) 
like that like solitary but like unlimited solitary that does not seem right either 

Recording: (5739/ 9621) 
down 

Recording: (5740/ 9621) 
and his parents can pick him up and everybody was annoyed my husband said i would have let her stay i do not understand why you are doing this i do not care i want her to come home well the bottom line it was hysterical because she and this little boy they are outside he is jumping on the trampoline i go out to him and i introduce myself and i say you know honey i said i am really sorry about the plans but i just could not let her stay there that long he goes oh that is ok my mom would never let me do that so i am thinking here is how everybody is acting like i am the bad guy and i am the one who is into right and so i used to take over i think it was funny because there was something she wanted to skip a play rehearsal that i would not let her skip because it was for a party that her friends were having and i understood it was important to her but when you have commitments you keep your commitments and so he was saying he agreed with me and i said look even your dad thinks that in this case she goes so what is with him he never has an opinion how come all of a sudden he is allowed to have an opinion tell me what i can do you know it was really funny we laughed about it and i let her i let her skip it because i decided that it was so important to her 

Recording: (5741/ 9621) 
yeah but i mean we are not in a depression and the employment rate is fine and health care we have got some improvements there and like i said that student loan thing it is a big nose but i just i mean so i would not say he is done a horrible horrible job but i mean i think that you just spend so much time focusing on other things and look at all the money that we have wasted where we could have spent that money on something else and you end up doing that 

Recording: (5742/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5743/ 9621)

things get away from it all yeah yeah so i came down here because he knew where my parents lived in plus columbus was a lot more opportunity 

Recording: (5844/ 9621) 
well i have found that i mean everyone has people from outside of the united states have stereotypes about the united states and when they actually get to know someone those stereotypes dissipate i mean i actually had a conversation very similar to this the other night with a couple of germans that i met at a coffee house i mean the stereotype that most americans have of germans are those of bavarians and not real bavarians but stereotypical bavarians beer drinking bratwurst eating sauerkraut eating lederhose wearing you know

they are like oh they are like the people in crocodile dundee but they are just no they are just like 

Recording: (5853/ 9621) 
i think for the most part people can handle it obviously i think probably more the older generations would be the ones that would have the bigger problem with it the ones that grew up like during the whole black rights movements and things like that i could see them having a problem with it but i mean more like more the generations of today or whatever like basically anyone under the age of about 40 or 50 or so i think that they could probably deal with it i mean i do not think it would cause any huge problems or anything like that 

Recording: (5854/ 9621) 
it is right on their main street and they have gorgeous really neat unique things 

Recording: (5855/ 9621) 
because they have done away with civil service step raises which were wrong because i could have done a crummy job and got the same raises doing a good job do not get me wrong but now it is that you got people you do not even respect in management a lot of times given the raises and they have no idea what you are even doing 

Recording: (5856/ 9621) 
and there is like nothing in it and you know it is like go down the list that is what i do he just thinks i automatically know i am a mind reader that is what it is 

Recording: (5857/ 9621) 
i am very proud of the way her and her sister are but i just think it is because mom was home and you know there was somebody there to listen to them and it does not have to be mom i mean you know mom can go work and dad can stay home there is nothing wrong with that either but i just think they need mom or dad there every day when they come home so they know when they come home and they have had a really bad day and something is really bothering them they can talk to it as opposed to sitting for two or three hours and letting it kind of fade away and then when everybody comes home it is like well how is school okay

Recording: (5911/ 9621) 
tied up to a fence you know i think they deserve to die because the prisons and the overcrowding that is a whole other subject you know that is just amazing to me so many people are in there that should be dead i feel because we are just paying for them to live in there 

Recording: (5912/ 9621) 
wow yeah 

Recording: (5913/ 9621) 
i do not know if that is what percolates it is very different in the public schools than the catholic school in the public school you have all the problems of society in the school you have the drugs you have the absentee parents you have the delinquency on the catholic school you do not have that for one thing it is oriented around the church even though we are not catholic it is still oriented that so there is a lot of values that permeates everything well they do not do that in the public school because if you do that somebody is gonna get ticked off it is the wrong value and why are you doing this to my kid so i think that is missing and that is a problem within the school the public schools so it just seems to be more distraction from the educational process i mean when you are in the catholic school and you are in classroom they deal with the discipline if they need to of course part of the way they deal with it is they take the real problems and send them back to the public schools but in the public schools you just have to deal with this all the time and i think it is harder for the teachers to teach because there is too much stuff in the way of what they really are there to do 

Recording: (5914/ 9621) 
i went to let me see i applied to emory harvard duke university of chicago and washington university so i got into three of those they were neat places

i mean i think that is the best way to address it and as far as the homosexual i think there is kids who say well maybe i am gay i do not know if i am gay or what well hopefully they will know their true identity eventually 

Recording: (5922/ 9621) 
oh most of it is horribly liberal and they always find some way to misrepresent like kerwin 

Recording: (5923/ 9621) 
indirectly yes 

Recording: (5924/ 9621) 
this will be something good to get on your tape and they have got people over there where i work at that they will give them the days off if their cats are sick 

Recording: (5925/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5926/ 9621) 
no i do not think it was because i grew up just basic not even really christian just really no real religion and i would been going to presbyterian church as i was about 19 years old looking for something a church i just had a feeling that i wanted to have that in my life because i would never had that before and so i was just looking around and i was open to anything i would listen to eastern religions and i have listened to the jehovah is witnesses and then when i read in the book of mormon it is a feeling of like i felt like i had heard it before and it sense to me and so that is why i really felt at home with this and that is why i decided to 

Recording: (5927/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (5928/ 9621) 
well that is probably the roof right there 

Recording: (5929/ 9621) 
with the naacp 

Recording: (5930/ 9621) 
i figure when the time comes we will just have to figure it out 

Recording: (5931/ 9621) 
and makes her look good 

Recording: (5932/ 9621) 
or do you want to run over me is that what you want to do 

Recording: (5933/ 9621) 
and 

Recording: (5934/ 9621) 
i think 

Recording: (5935/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5936/ 9621) 
well my youngest son married a catholic girl who was from a large catholic family and their kids were going to a catholic school 

Recording: (5937/ 9621) 
wall that sacred heat wall 

Recording: (5938/ 9621) 
it is great cause he is heavy he is killing my back oh yeah that is what everyone says you think 

Recording: (5939/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5940/ 9621) 
but then there is a lot you know that they could do with that mall too that might make me even want to go there more 

Recording: (5941/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5942/ 9621) 
i have not personally researched it but i have seen i would personally research it if i was president documentaries and whatnot and things on 2020 which i do not wholeheartedly believe just because it is on tv and they say it is so but if it is true and it probably is just because a lot of people will research it once it is on tv that three stri strikes and you are out has really seemed to work in california because most of the people that are committing the violent crimes with guns or rapes or whatnot are doing most of the crime so once they are locked up yeah it costs more money to house them for life but they are saving so much because crime has gone down because these people are in jail and not on the streets anymore so they do not have to catch them they do not have to process them et cetera so i would really like to see that and plus i think once that really is in the works and really working and we really do what we are gonna say we are doing instead of like little parents no parents no honey do not do that no honey do not do that you know what i mean because i think that is part of our problem too 

Recording: (5943/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5944/ 9621) 
let is put it this way when i was a kid you did not want to be brought home by the police you were actually scared of the police nowadays what is a kid scared of nothing

Recording: (5952/ 9621) 
you know it is a real word and you really have to think about it when you start getting there because it was tough dropping them off when they were six weeks old and you are going oh jeez are we doing the right thing but you know some of the stuff they do and some of the stuff they learn and come home with we sit down and talk about it and we are just like i do not think we could have ever dreamed up all this stuff you know and you know kept them entertained all day long by ourselves you know there is no kids in the neighborhood like it was when we were kids you know they are all at daycare you know they just are not around anymore it is not the same anymore where you know every other house had some kids and mom was home and stuff so you know they have made a lot of friends through there and they still the daughter who is in a different school still associates with friends that are in other school systems that she met at the daycare 

Recording: (5953/ 9621)

i was only there for a couple weeks in the harbor i never set foot on land 

Recording: (5984/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5985/ 9621) 
so what was different about it service winter quarter i took all classes off winter quarter and worked for a courier service because i needed some money and i love driving and let me tell you it is really really different driving around in the big city compared to out in the country man i mean you are flying down 71 or 70 through town and you go as fast as everybody else is going and if they are going 80 you are going 80 and if they are going 2 you are going 2 i mean my dad i brought him down to columbus a few times because my dad and i are real close and i am driving around and i will zip in between cars and he is like i forgot what it is like living in a city because he used to live in chicago but that is one of the things i really enjoy one of the things i do not like about living in a big city is but i have gotten used to but i do not like the fact that every time you look up in the night sky all you see is this like orange haze you can not see stars very well the noise i mean there is always noise i remember last year living in the dorms every morning at 230 in the morning there was a trash truck that picked up some trash from a bar right behind where we lived and i lived in taylor so it is in a tshape and this side of the building all the sound just rolls right up the wall and this trash truck made so much stinking noise it was ridiculous every single morning at 230 i developed the ability to sleep through anything and that is one of the fascinating things when i go home dead silence dead silence and that is now where i have a problem sleeping because there is no noise there is no noise i am so used to turning my radio on and drowning out all the background sound that i have the opposite thing i can not go at night got a special show coming in or not but that is the place i really like going they are open until usually 230 2 oclock all depends i also found something fascinating i came to columbus and raised in this really really really conservative extremely christian religious community of ashland and i came to columbus and i started meeting the extremely taboo group of homosexuals and i have found some of the most fascinating people on this planet are homosexuals and they are not nearly they are not the evil people that everybody back home in our community always said they were it is just like these are normal people i may not agree with what they are doing but they are normal people and i have met some really cool people who are homosexuals and that leading where that was going we went to axis which is one of the gay dance clubs in columbus it is on high street it is down in a german village no it is not is it down in 

Recording: (5986/ 9621) 
i am 

Recording: (5987/ 9621) 
you know they want to be judges like everybody else but you know i think they have so many different ideas and not that either one of them is right but still i think there is always going to be a barrier there they are just kids or just not all kids are going to get along you know i mean 

Recording: (5988/ 9621) 
my background 

Recording: (5989/ 9621) 
and you know you have a hard thing there but then if you teach the teachers that they are not going to be quiet and they are not going to you know look at this flattery 

Recording: (5990/ 9621) 
we have not been there in a while but i mean we do go 

Recording: (5991/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5992/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5993/ 9621) 
and so it is the thing is though it is almost like i am really glad that willing to say i just can not make those he let he let my daughter who is 13 he left left her at the movies one night they went to the movies there was no the movie they went to see was sold out the next one was not going to start until 930 which means this kid is 12 years old so that would have been 11 312 you know at the lennox he leaves her there with one of her friends some boy and although this is a tomboy who is just amazing but so anyhow he left her there and they said they called me but i was wearing the sweeper so i did not hear the phone so left her there and he said that she was going to call back you know at a certain time and i was going to tell her what she could or could not do so i said you know we are going to have to come here home you know he is going to have to come and get you oh we are not gonna do that i you know you can not be this late so he went back down picked him up and i said let the kid come to our house he can come here until 11 

Recording: (5994/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (5995/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5996/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5997/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (5998/ 9621) 
you know what i mean 

Recording: (5999/ 9621) 
the bad places the television things that they have on the programs they have on and i think that that is had a lot to do with changing our younger generation in a way they think the way they act what their morals are and i think that is why they are having more shootings in schools and the programs are terrible i think that they need to really redo them there is too much profanity there is too much sex there is too much just do what i want i got to do my own thing that is what it when the i want to do my own thing started he says with the women is feminist movement and it probably did and it probably did have something to do with it because after all somebody speaking up and they want to do things my well bing crosby who was it no 

Recording: (6000/ 9621) 
there is the ones that will get out there with their picket signs and raise hell okay 

Recording: (6001/ 9621) 
ha ha 

Recording: (6002/ 9621) 
yeah exactly and it is just ridiculous but so many people do not seem to think that way i do think yeah access it would help if access were restricted or at least if they were more careful about it i mean it seems like even the laws that there are in place now are not necessarily followed and you know that kind of thing 

Recording: (6003/ 9621) 
because they are so stylish 

Recording: (6004/ 9621) 
it is difficult you feel alone a lot of the time and i am not as liberal as i used to be i think with age i get tempered a little bit but still tend to be a little more liberal it does not matter who i vote for they are gonna lose and i just stay out of a lot of discussions it was interesting our mother raised us in a way that we were always allowed to discuss politics and religion anything we wanted to but she would stop if it got to the point where we were getting physical or name calling or something like that and it was long after i left home actually before i realized that not everybody is that way not everybody wants to hear your views so i particularly around my inlaws they are very conservative of southern ohio raised during the depression in a depressed area so i learned my motherinlaw took any time you disagreed with her as a personal attack on her so i just learned not to say anything yeah my fatherinlaw was not that way but my motherinlaw was 

Recording: (6005/ 9621) 
very different there is been a lot of innovations 

Recording: (6006/ 9621) 
um i mean fact of the matter is if being gay is a genetic disorder then that should have no effect on the kids because they should still be uh normal i guess or whatever you want to say 

Recording: (6007/ 9621) 
i hate life 

Recording: (6008/ 9621) 
um well because my cousins and uh they all have a they are very you know welleducated and they are more affluent and i think that uh maybe there would have been more opportunity for my dad there 

Recording: (6009/ 9621) 
mhm 

Recording: (6010/ 9621) 
he found out he could just move yeah so he always got away from that 

Recording: (6011/ 9621) 
oh you have to nowadays you know i do not understand the men nowadays that believe that the wife still does all the duties at home plus has a fulltime job that just does not happen now now you know if your wife did not work you could expect these things but she is doing 40 hours a week too so it is it is work and it is a fulltime job they start the sevenyear just brought it here it is the end of the year second grade she brings home this project gonna have to have a book report use three books of reference you know she is never done anything like this it was the battle all weekend long you know getting this information out of her you know she had to pick an animal and do a whole report on it she is gonna have to stand up in front of the class and make a box with a display in it and i was still trying to figure out how to write it already that is all she writes in now i mean it seemed like they were teaching it then maybe might be learning something yeah she is in fractions she is doing fractions she is doing percentages already in second grade and i thought we were one plus one two plus you know in second grade it just seems like they are three years ahead 

Recording: (6012/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6013/ 9621) 
later next afterward 

Recording: (6014/ 9621) 
so i do not know just lucky 

Recording: (6015/ 9621) 
and they end up okay anyway that is good 

Recording: (6016/ 9621) 
아하 

Recording: (6017/ 9621) 
well yeah we got broke into i think twice and stuff got stolen my truck is been broken into my mom is car is been broken into the gas siphon pretty much everybody around here is been criminalized one way or another 

Recording: (6018/ 9621) 
so it is kind of the mentality if my parents did okay without it then i do not need it 

Recording: (6019/ 9621) 
hello 

Recording: (6020/ 9621) 
you know how far they held responsible i do not know you would have to go on a casebycase basis 

Recording: (6021/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6022/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6023/ 9621) 
and i did have a very serious relationship in florida he was quite a bit younger than i was and i knew he wanted children and i never wanted children unfortunately i love animals and things but i just never decided i never wanted children and i knew he eventually would so i was engaged to him but i decided to 

Recording: (6024/ 9621) 
wow i am getting nervous 

Recording: (6025/ 9621) 
uhuh 

Recording: (6026/ 9621) 
the most part yeah i mean obviously like they said they came out and said the catholic church was against it but at the same time like with research things like that where they are saying that it could be a mental disorder of some sorts where i mean they could not can not so much really condemn it to to the point anymore that they used to 

Recording: (6027/ 9621) 
but it is because most people would have sold it and moved to a more expensive home and had a bigger mortgage so it is just that kind of thing 

Recording: (6028/ 9621) 
i do not know actually probably if i went up there now i would like it but i do not like it as well as columbus at all mainly i suppose because of the university 

Recording: (6029/ 9621) 
just you know 

Recording: (6030/ 9621) 
but we really have not talked about that but my exwife is got family here so she comes in about two or three weeks at least out of the summer 

Recording: (6031/ 9621) 
i heard about that but the same principle applies but i am talking about just everyday things that people you want to talk about children primarily there is no penalty anymore parents are scared to death to pick one up and spank them even with their bare hands or to make them stand in a corner because they considered and going back to the word harassment child abuse and harassment of consequence and a penalty can be a very very simple thing a mother can simply look at janie and say janie you should not do that 

Recording: (6032/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (6033/ 9621) 
well yeah i think it is real important to really get a good feel for how you are and all your beliefs and all that they have to really match and if they do not then it is not ever going to work because there is always going to be conflict and friction and all that kind of thing so i think it is real important and there is no age limit on that to when you really feel good about yourself and you really know what you want to do then that is the only time that you can really commit and say yeah we do have a mutual thing and young people there is so many different infatuations to start with that they get blinded and they get off course and everything else and then it does not stay the same i mean it is all exciting and all that and then i think it is kind of 

Recording: (6034/ 9621) 
i blew a disc out 

Recording: (6035/ 9621) 
like not go out pretty much your tv is your entertainment for the year 

Recording: (6036/ 9621)

Recording: (6037/ 9621)

Recording: (6038/ 9621) 
when he died i was about 30 

Recording: (6039/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6040/ 9621) 
i know the valedictorian of harvard like in the junior class 

Recording: (6041/ 9621) 
yeah much too fast for me 

Recording: (6042/ 9621) 
connecting some wires are crossed up here or something and so they become very distrustful of adults because all their life people have been saying 

Recording: (6043/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6044/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6045/ 9621) 
that encompasses the theory that all things happen for a reason even though it seems like it is chaos even though it seems like it is an accident there is a flow of spirit in this world things are moving at a pace that they are supposed to move at and things happen and death is part of life physical death and that is one of the things i also learned through this was that you do not die you do not physically maybe you know there is no denying that but spiritually not even physical death can break that it will not 

Recording: (6046/ 9621)

names i actually read a story in some book about this black lady that was having like her ninth and tenth kid and she did not know what she had twins and she did not know what to name them and she would run out of names that she liked so they brought her lunch in to her and the nurse jokingly said or the aide or something well just pick a couple names off the menu so she named them limongelo and arangelo lemongelo orangejello she picked lemongelo orangejello and turned them into limongelo and arangelo denise and denefue 

Recording: (6066/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (6067/ 9621) 
you know technically there is insanity and there is not insanity but in my opinion there is nobody who ever killed anybody who is not insane and just to knock them out is not appropriate they need to be we need to try to save them i mean not in the terms of a christian saving but to make them work that off and face it and come in their own mind to their own guilt and so i have got two sides to that one is they need to work because they did it and the other side is if we keep i believe in the reincarnation the law of cause and effect and if a person murders somebody they will pay for that later there is no question about that in the next life but also i think that they should be made to face their guilt and what they have done and a lot of them do not they say that hardened criminals real hard criminals will not ever admit that they did anything wrong and they have to they need to 

Recording: (6068/ 9621) 
to get them thinking about it then they will start to notice it in their real life and once they start noticing it they will start getting more and more into it 

Recording: (6069/ 9621) 
do not say oh well your son is gonna be gay he is two right now let us you know change this so it does not come out to be a problem or whatever but i mean i think they need to leave that to the decision of the people 

Recording: (6070/ 9621) 
is 

Recording: (6071/ 9621) 
you can not be mad at somebody for choosing a lifestyle life is too short you can love them either way it does not make any difference 

Recording: (6072/ 9621) 
right same way with kids if you have a penalty for them they will learn their lesson but it is also the parent that has to set the example and there is too many older folks right now i do not think because of two people had to work outside the house they get home they are aggravated they are upset somebody else had their kids all day and it is terrible that the situation is got that way but i do believe that the older people including our people and everybody that is at the top has to set the example and stick with it 

Recording: (6073/ 9621) 
as he was speaking and as he started to speak i realized too another thing that i really feel has a tremendous impression on how we as people are doing here but how the politicians are is because the world in essence is getting smaller because the communication has gotten better and all these other countries and us are just like oh one country anymore or something and i think that is had a tremendous influence also on our politics and on we as a people 

Recording: (6074/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (6075/ 9621) 
now that was up to age 18 too or there about too i think that the you said you get back to the very beginning of the birth and up to kindergarten and so forth well that is the family i think that we in our educational program we really need to start teaching what i call the older values but good values i do not care whether they are old or new but good values and i think we really need to have that established within our educational system starting in the elementary right on up through college i think there ought to be a number of courses that are devoted exclusively for this so that those students can go back and assist in teaching but i think that many of the courses other courses ought to have elements within them that are teaching value family values i could even go so far as to say in chemistry or botany or psychology any one of those those are specialized subjects but i think there are elements that they can have within each one of those talking about family value family value and that will help then permeate the entire society but it is got to start back here in the first and i think 

Recording: (6076/ 9621) 
and sooner or later you know all the people that have gotten into political offices and public service i guarantee you they went in it with the ideal of wanting to help and make a difference but once they get in there it is such a bureaucracy 

Recording: (6077/ 9621) 
and it is not just like one group of people 

Recording: (6078/ 9621) 
that that is what is making these kids think they can do it i just really think 

Recording: (6079/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6080/ 9621) 
oh you do know 

Recording: (6081/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6082/ 9621) 
in english 

Recording: (6083/ 9621) 
yeah so i have experience in that and i am thankful that it was always a peaceful sort of thing although what is going on inside your head and your body is not that peaceful 

Recording: (6084/ 9621) 
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 

Recording: (6085/ 9621) 
for example so you should name her tamara 

Recording: (6086/ 9621) 
i have just the same opinion i think most people have as a tv 

Recording: (6087/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (6088/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6089/ 9621) 
with that boy 

Recording: (6090/ 9621) 
pots never been associated with any kind of a crime that were some violent crime 

Recording: (6091/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6092/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (6093/ 9621) 
but then you have a choice there you would not necessarily have you should have had more selfcontrol and not had the child do not expect me to pay for your lack of willpower that is a selfish attitude that is stealing as well 

Recording: (6094/ 9621) 
i see no 

Recording: (6095/ 9621) 
in a way yeah i think that would be good yeah maybe a new name 

Recording: (6096/ 9621) 
well you know the crime you can not really stop and other things that happen just you know too much partying around i mean that is why i left 12th avenue because i could not you know but you know just everybody the neighbors being loud and everything my mom is older so she can not really put up with any of that 

Recording: (6097/ 9621) 
i am just kind of appalled at what they put on the news anyway it is not usually what i consider news it is a lot of human interest stories and things like that which 

Recording: (6098/ 9621) 
really and it is bizarre 

Recording: (6099/ 9621) 
i do not know i mean i like florida just because it is not cold and it is it is really nice but it rains a lot i mean and i do not i mean i would rather live out west because it is like a dry heat as opposed to being i mean it is nice that it is 90 degrees but it is not nice it is like 90 humidity i mean that is kind of that kind of sucks but it is just different to live in florida and how you think of florida being is real different i like it because the drivers are not so insane like they are here people are a little bit more laid back just because i do not know in parts it is really insane but sometimes people just like because it is nice weather people do not get so aggravated by like here it is like cold and gray and you just want to like yell at people in their car and suffer something i do not know i do not know if you will steal this i 

Recording: (6100/ 9621) 
basically because the plans which the utilities had for our location they could not provide to us because of the divestiture ruling so we had to go out and do our own surveys become selfeducated through courses through att and through purdue university it was i think ou had some courses and ultimately the university here now has i think a major in telecommunication group but the project basically we were going from putting together a network itself and we had you think of a party line system or they used to call it daisy chain in the industry you had to wait and wait for your turn to get onto a data network and we got down to the point where we went to a spoke network where everyone had a dedicated pipe 

Recording: (6101/ 9621) 
well i have been see i was not much being here and my daughter being there i did not really have the time with her that i wish i would have had you know but her mother you know did her all right and everything but i wish i would have been more involved in her growing up and i think two people families are generally better you know for not necessarily living being married and everything 

Recording: (6102/ 9621) 
sean is in yeah we do not have enough saxophones sure we could use you 

Recording: (6103/ 9621) 
yeah my brother well he is the oldest oldest but two sisters pretty much all the ones i really care about two sisters and their husbands 

Recording: (6104/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (6105/ 9621) 
eh it was not anything too huge i think it had about 1200 people in it or so 

Recording: (6106/ 9621) 
yeah like a lot of people i do not know why a lot of people go but with a lot of people i know it is like go to hear really good music and it is amazing what happens you know people together people dancing together you look out and everybody is dancing and the music is really good and everybody is really into it and working 

Recording: (6107/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6108/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6109/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6110/ 9621) 
most people i associate with in this and that are a lot more involved with their kids than say our parents were as kids 

Recording: (6111/ 9621) 
ha 

Recording: (6112/ 9621) 
but you know that there and goes back to you know the quality of the quantity i mean obviously this poor kid you know apparently was so miserable in his life that he was going down the stairs in the basement to you know to figure out some way of reaching his nirvana or whatever you know and then his parents did not have a clue or if they did they did not care you know 

Recording: (6113/ 9621) 
but at the same time it is not like they had the intent to do it so i can not see anything too incredibly severe but i mean i almost think it should be considered basically child neglect things like that basically the same penalties that you would run into for that but i mean they obviously do need to make it more severe because obviously your kid has the opportunity to kill themselves with a gun 

Recording: (6114/ 9621) 
oh yes definitely in england too 

Recording: (6115/ 9621) 
to heat in 

Recording: (6116/ 9621) 
yeah so and a lot of people turn 18 when they are in high school so i am sure they can go get one there 

Recording: (6117/ 9621) 
all right let us begin 

Recording: (6118/ 9621) 
yes i do but i try to visit at least every two years either we go to new york or we meet halfway a couple years ago we met at penn state and so you know the older ones they are all dying off though 

Recording: (6119/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6120/ 9621) 
yeah 84 

Recording: (6121/ 9621) 
oh it is just so the environment of course is incredibly beautiful and everybody is more i think more open or more receptive to relationships and you know i think it is a much friendlier place and then i just think the vibrations are higher out there you just do not have poverty well if anybody is in poverty in oregon it is because they have chosen to live a simple life it is not because they can not get jobs and things like that although the economy in oregon is not that great but they say in eugene that even the dishwashers have phds well the level of the years of education per capita is probably the highest in the country 

Recording: (6122/ 9621) 
are there other important roles where would those nuns be where would your mother possibly have been if she went to catholic school i take it where would she have been if it were not for the nuns why we put nuns down hey they worked a lot less than your mother is even getting compensated for and they had a very important role for your development even though your generation is removed 

Recording: (6123/ 9621) 
yeah yeah and the funny thing about that is if i heard one of those songs once i might not be that turned off by it but if you are going to play it at me you know six times in three hours 

Recording: (6124/ 9621) 
i heard something the other day that really upset me i was at this convention downtown the convention center and one of the ladies that was presenting one of the workshops is a college professor in english at one of the ohio colleges and she said when she started teaching in 1985 they would always she teaches writing technical writing for people to do when they get out into the industry world reports and stuff she said they used to say gear your writing to a person who is in the eighth grade 

Recording: (6125/ 9621) 
that is great 

Recording: (6126/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6127/ 9621) 
well actually i have picked up a parttime job just in the past month or two so i am working for a research firm just for the convenience of the hours i want to go back into the nursing field but right now i just can not take that much time away because it would be at least an eighthour shift and i do not think that we are ready for that yet he is a teacher he works at a high school yeah he teaches ninth and tenth graders 10 years do you ever think my kids are experiencing i did not know about whatever until i was much much older i did not worry about that when i was that age it is kind of scary 

Recording: (6128/ 9621) 
and they are not the kind that would go out and just shoot an animal they would use it for food i know one time that they gave it to a family that did not have any money and did not have any food they went and killed some animals and gave it to them i do not have a problem with that but my brotherinlaw is very much opposed to any kind of gun control he believes whatever charlton heston tells him 

Recording: (6129/ 9621) 
i think my grandpa goes to church 

Recording: (6130/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6131/ 9621) 
i mean 

Recording: (6132/ 9621) 
and he travels all over the state of ohio 

Recording: (6133/ 9621) 
ah wow 

Recording: (6134/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6135/ 9621) 
and unfortunately they did not really prove anything except that death is final 

Recording: (6136/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (6137/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6138/ 9621) 
you you why are you be doing eight children 

Recording: (6139/ 9621) 
i think it would probably i think it would be certainly interesting 

Recording: (6140/ 9621) 
yes and no like i said i think the average person is pretty decent person i mean i do not think there is anything violent or there is anything wrong with them but at the same time it is just the media focuses on the ones that are out of control and makes a big deals of the ones that are out of control and i think that is sort of what people pick up the perception to be i mean they do not they do not show about like when people are helping people out or things like that when the local high school is like volunteering at like the local senior citizens home or something like that 

Recording: (6141/ 9621) 
but i mean like if test scores are identical and they have the exact same experience you know objective ways 

Recording: (6142/ 9621) 
because i do not know it just was like if i get pregnant i get pregnant you do not know of what you really have to go through of having a baby you know because i guess i really did not care if i got pregnant i got pregnant it did not really register in my mind that this will not ruin but it will change your whole life 

Recording: (6143/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6144/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6145/ 9621) 
yeah and it just did not work 

Recording: (6146/ 9621) 
it is in northern ohio it is near illyria which is west of cleveland 

Recording: (6147/ 9621) 
i am just gonna try with it 

Recording: (6148/ 9621) 
and i know that in my case i will use a personal case i will use frank my older son the ones i am speaking of the boys going on 17 the one little girl just turned 11 the other one turned 8 well they go over to the one grandparent is house and she has a habit of paying them for little jobs they do around the house so consequently when they come to my house 

Recording: (6149/ 9621) 
and the second tornado it was not as bad i mean we was driving up after he ripped me off and he said well i am taking your sorry ass back to columbus and i said ok go for it i am just sitting there smiling all the way up knowing what he did not know we get to tennessee and the weather is kind of bad there too i am like hey man slow down you do not have any windshield wipers in the middle of this rainstorm 

Recording: (6150/ 9621) 
girls i have never seen them take a guy out of a bar 

Recording: (6151/ 9621) 
heh heh heh heh heh 

Recording: (6152/ 9621) 
they more or less buy a dog for a token 

Recording: (6153/ 9621) 
well i guess i would have to say i do not necessarily like middle school but see when you get a special ed certificate you are certified kindergarten through 12th so i did several years in the high school when i was first out of college i did high school first then i went to elementary while my kids were in elementary so i could kind of keep in touch with what they were supposed to be learning you know and then six years ago i went to the middle school and i have decided that i am too old to keep up with these kids not only are they learning disability and add but they are middle schoolers and they have like hormones running rampant all over the outside of their bodies you can not tell which is the hormones and which is the add and which is the learning disability but like i said i only have two more years to go so i guess i can live through that 

Recording: (6154/ 9621) 
i think it is better probably if they do not have you say anything about it you know and most of the people you know like when you get to i lived in the barracks all the time but i mean you know a lot of people you know they get their own places off base you know who cares what they i mean i do not care you know like i say i have gay friends that you know i do not care what they do i mean they are old enough to do whatever the heck they wanna do you know 

Recording: (6155/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (6156/ 9621) 
short north it is in the short north but it is so much fun it is absolutely so much fun because it is really weird you normally do not get hit on by girls when you go to a regular dance club but when you go to axis you do not get hit on by girls you get hit on by guys i dance with glowsticks and i have had like seven guys come up to me in one night and they are just like can you do that for me 

Recording: (6157/ 9621) 
we have fun 

Recording: (6158/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6159/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6160/ 9621) 
yeah he wants to teach he likes football and he wants to coach football but you have to teach to do that 

Recording: (6161/ 9621) 
hear and now that is the most newsworthy story out there so i think yeah the press have a lot to do with it the media 

Recording: (6162/ 9621) 
it is an ego trip that is all it is basically it is like look i can do this 

Recording: (6163/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6164/ 9621) 
oh my gosh it was just unbelievable he got really sick after that rush week yeah really sick so they wanted him to move in the fraternity house he can not really afford it but they just sent me a really nice letter saying he is like in the top of their chapter academically and everything so i am thinking they might help him out a little bit they want him in the house real bad 

Recording: (6165/ 9621) 
basically it is just the talk and stuff it is not like you know what i mean i am black i am better or i am white i am better it is none of that 

Recording: (6166/ 9621) 
yum 

Recording: (6167/ 9621) 
yeah it is gone downhill a lot 

Recording: (6168/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6169/ 9621) 
and if you know any teenagers the more strict you make it the more they rebel 

Recording: (6170/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6171/ 9621) 
i from my perspective which is skewed of course to me i think it just seems that way i mean we are only talking about 10 cases that is not very many i mean you could by coincidence have them all be african american if i were african american i think i would have a different perspective and i do not live in a neighborhood where we see a lot of police so i am not in touch with that situation 

Recording: (6172/ 9621) 
so if you can bring any pets but say if you had a dog could you bring it back to the states so you have to leave all those 

Recording: (6173/ 9621) 
well we went in at naples 

Recording: (6174/ 9621) 
nope 

Recording: (6175/ 9621) 
oh well we really wants to go he lived in california that is where that family i told you about was and when he was 14 or 16 and he really wants to go back so we will probably end up there sometime but after i finish school and after he works for a little while and i work and so that we can have enough money i mean we do not need to have a ton but we just should be at least a little out of debt yeah something 

Recording: (6176/ 9621) 
it is just 

Recording: (6177/ 9621) 
so i am like 

Recording: (6178/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (6179/ 9621) 
mmm 

Recording: (6180/ 9621) 
we have definitely made some progress in that direction i still think that there is considerable progression that needs to be made i was just talking to someone a couple weeks ago who is a fellow history major and her and actually her brother is a fellow history major too and a friend of mine i do not know him all that well but apparently her family i mean she is double major in history and chemistry she plans to go to med school her parents her family supports her in this but they have made it painfully clear that she should not plan on having a career because she is gonna have to raise children at some point which is that is not the way things should work in my belief and the fact that it is like the males telling the daughter this is how things need to be i think an individual should have the choice but i feel i am concerned about this push to the right that is sort of going on hoping it is sort of dying out but i mean it seemed a little scarier back in like 94 95 but i think we have reached a point where because not all of the advances have been 100 successful the opposition is criticizing the advance 

Recording: (6181/ 9621) 
but when he did have something to do with it it was kind of strange they would go out and whistle at girls and stuff like that 

Recording: (6182/ 9621) 
the big things 

Recording: (6183/ 9621) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (6184/ 9621) 
yeah pretty much 

Recording: (6185/ 9621) 
the 

Recording: (6186/ 9621) 
well the main thing is they never leave they go a lot of them through their senior year and graduate ohio state has the lowest gpa of any college 

Recording: (6187/ 9621) 
so but i had some really tough challenging jobs and yeah if i knew now what i knew then i probably could be a millionaire with all the lawsuits of different yeah experience with sexual harassment 

Recording: (6188/ 9621) 
oh well in oregon well i was down in california for three months and i went to the produce stand and i took my umbrella and of course it does not rain too much in california and i said oh i am from oregon and i always think it is going to rain and he said well i am from washington and i know it is going to rain 

Recording: (6189/ 9621) 
so if you want to give me two more minutes to play okay now you got another leg but the thing is let me ask you a question how does that impact you if you can not be a priest are not there other important quoteunquote roles for women in the church are not there other important roles 

Recording: (6190/ 9621) 
on the spur of the moment i would have to think about that i really would 

Recording: (6191/ 9621) 
i 

Recording: (6192/ 9621) 
it is like hitting me and i just i am not sure you can tell me if it is not anywhere near my mouth 

Recording: (6193/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6194/ 9621) 
yeah i want to i just do not do it 

Recording: (6195/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6196/ 9621) 
yeah the media exposure 

Recording: (6197/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6198/ 9621) 
did not like it huh 

Recording: (6199/ 9621) 
it is like you are doing interviews 

Recording: (6200/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6201/ 9621) 
right right right 

Recording: (6202/ 9621) 
yeah and then i will show that son of a gun i will shoot him like the guys that were supposed to be picking him i do not even know whether he even shot him then but yeah i think they kind of just thought i will prove to them that they can not push me around 

Recording: (6203/ 9621) 
but northland mall is where i do go shopping 

Recording: (6204/ 9621) 
what the hell am i doing here 

Recording: (6205/ 9621) 
bye 

Recording: (6206/ 9621) 
i think i would say the same thing because of course we had the benefit of having a mother who was very giving i mean i think i learned a lot from her selflessness 

Recording: (6207/ 9621) 
why is that 

Recording: (6208/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6209/ 9621) 
in what way 

Recording: (6210/ 9621) 
no what really when aids started i had a one of my best friend is brother had died of it and that really after that i like you know was like i have to wear condoms because i was scared to death to get aids you know so i did wear condoms you know probably after a few years of having sex without condoms 

Recording: (6211/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (6212/ 9621) 
i have been playing video games since i was two 

Recording: (6213/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (6214/ 9621) 
it is magnified and or yeah they have that choice they can say well listen you do not understand and blah blah blah and i have tried that but the best i can do now is try and advocate for myself in terms of listen i hear what you are saying but i am trying to show you that and tell you how i work best so as long as you can try not to dictate to me and allow me some freedom and give me goals of what you want to accomplish and give me the freedom to accomplish in the way that i can do it not by quotas and deadlines and crap like that i can show you what to do and that is is the struggle i am having right now trying to find employment where people will cut me some slack and i wanted to do some driving but you know because at least out on the road i do not have to put up with anyone is crap but long drive and long distances is not good for me focusing concentrating and i have had several accidents several tickets so i mean i have even had two other head injuries 

Recording: (6215/ 9621) 
no that is true 

Recording: (6216/ 9621) 
but i can certainly see that i think that a lot of people feel like too he is one of us he is like we are well michigan it is a 10 year mandatory jail time sentence if you get caught with any cocaine at all 

Recording: (6217/ 9621) 
and that is pretty much the way i felt the whole day because i was just smiling on the inside 

Recording: (6218/ 9621) 
ehh 

Recording: (6219/ 9621) 
i am 

Recording: (6220/ 9621) 
bye 

Recording: (6221/ 9621) 
and the battle at fallen timbers here is my rough draft would you fix it for me before i make my final copy so i will get a good grade see i tell them i say that is what i am here for you know i am here to help you use me to help you get better grades use me to run interference if you think you know the science but you are getting marked down because you can not spell the words let me know i will go talk to your science teacher tell her not to count your spelling or not you know not to make you take the test without the little spell checker thing that is in your book bag to let you use that i mean i do a lot of what i call advocating for my kids with the regular ed teachers that do not understand i go in and i say well you know this is kind of a long test could he maybe take half today and half tomorrow or would you mind if he came out to my room ninth period during study hall because i have a free period and i could like kind of monitor it and read the words he does not know so that he is actually answering what the question really says instead of what he thinks it says so that you will not be testing his reading ability but you will really be testing whether he knows about magnetism 

Recording: (6222/ 9621) 
i am not sure if i am paying attention 

Recording: (6223/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6224/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6225/ 9621) 
mhm 

Recording: (6226/ 9621) 
yeah and then i went to work before that i had to walk from hilliard one day through matter of fact through this 12th avenue stretch right there 

Recording: (6227/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6228/ 9621) 
to get them to do what they do to even help blind people or to help people that have other physical disabilities you can tell from the way the dog is in terms of the way the dog behaves with the person that has the disability that they have been trained for you can tell whether they have been trained the right way or whatever so i thought about that but you know i have not given them much more than just a thought but i looked at a veterinary assistant and i went in there and it was not i was there just for a half a day and they were telling me about some of these people out there that you know i do not understand the law again but you know there is people out there that will go out and they will buy a dog you know a nice dog because they do not want to make the time to train it and spend the time with it because they take a lot of time and discipline and love and care just like a child 

Recording: (6229/ 9621) 
i 

Recording: (6230/ 9621) 
yeah of course you know babies tend not to be on time 

Recording: (6231/ 9621) 
it is still on but i do not know 

Recording: (6232/ 9621) 
and then she is the one that i will be hearing you know you do not know what they are like black ass and all this you know they are prejudiced and all she is doing is yelling about being prejudiced their prejudice against her because boy she do not understand that is her damn job 

Recording: (6233/ 9621) 
you are much bigger and you can control the thing and keep it away from her yeah but i do not want somebody else telling me what they can watch and not watch that is my job but i do not know how i mean the media supposedly i mean this may be the way it works the media presents this stuff and people watch it or read it or whatever they do not but it is when it is like the constant barrage that this is what you get the monica lewinsky stuff every day there was a new twist on this story that or the news was that there was not a news twist yeah i do not care but you could not turn it off because that is all that was on 

Recording: (6234/ 9621) 
and started playing mp3s 

Recording: (6235/ 9621) 
yeah yeah and the university knows that is going on 

Recording: (6236/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (6237/ 9621) 
it got out of control 

Recording: (6238/ 9621) 
ah it is good 

Recording: (6239/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (6240/ 9621) 
マスク 

Recording: (6241/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (6242/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6243/ 9621) 
two years 

Recording: (6244/ 9621) 
absolutely 

Recording: (6245/ 9621) 
the city just could not believe 

Recording: (6246/ 9621) 
and you know it is oh you have got art we are open to that you know 

Recording: (6247/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6248/ 9621) 
yeah it worked out fine for us 

Recording: (6249/ 9621) 
yeah it is really not something you see in worthington 

Recording: (6250/ 9621) 
but see his father lived right around the corner and never even had nothing to do with them 

Recording: (6251/ 9621) 
i mean soon like fedex and all that is probably going to be there is probably going to be no one working there they are probably going to make it all machinery you know 

Recording: (6252/ 9621) 
which is pretty well to the south end of italy we went up through the mountains we did not seewell we went up tolet us see now well we went about halfway up to between naples and rome 

Recording: (6253/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (6254/ 9621) 
i do not know anything about it but he lived in lompoc which is i think it is near santa barbara but we have talked about la i do not know anything i have heard terrible things about it 

Recording: (6255/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (6256/ 9621) 
at this point i blame it on the administration and the citizens of columbus have not i mean two years ago or was it three years ago now they defeated a levy you should never defeat a school levy 

Recording: (6257/ 9621) 
that makes it hard if you got a family you want to spend a night out on the town with your family man that kind of blows your whole budget for the year 

Recording: (6258/ 9621) 
yeah they will just take one scripture and they will expand it and they will just run with that one scripture and then there are also churches that will just delete in their minds they will delete certain sections of the scripture that they do not like first corinthians chapter 12 talks about spiritual gifts and that is one of the big things that i am into down here in columbus and the fact that they still exist like healing people and spiritual gifts like healing people and the extremely taboo religious topic among a lot of churches is the gift of tongues whether it is dead whether it is not whether it is inspired whether it is not inspired yada yada blah blah well i had not even heard about it until i got to columbus because and i know the bible pretty well and i had not even heard about it until i got to columbus and i get to columbus and i am like okay this is pretty cool i went home and i am talking to some people in my parents church and they are like oh yeah we just do not really talk about that very often and i am just 

Recording: (6259/ 9621) 
yeah they would just kick him to the hallway he was either in the hallway or in the office and the nuns would say oh we love him to come here because he can answer all our trivia questions 

Recording: (6260/ 9621) 
and i could not walk at all 

Recording: (6261/ 9621) 
bye 

Recording: (6262/ 9621) 
if you can not play you will not learn you will just sit there and follow my directions and that is dumb 

Recording: (6263/ 9621) 
he cleans his 

Recording: (6264/ 9621) 
yeah we had any not really just modest dresses you could not wear pants and dresses could not be ankle length they could not be at the knee it had to be midknee or whatever that is calf and that was certain restrictions but yeah i mean basically just modest whatever i mean i wear boots with the dress in russia 

Recording: (6265/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6266/ 9621) 
oh there always has been there always has been i think a lot of people feel that kids a lot of kids are on medication today that should not be but i think that is the fault of the school or the parents or some doctor that like for example when we refer kids in worthington to a doctor we have a list of three doctors that we work with and we know that they will not just give this kid a pill if he does not have eight out of the 12 symptoms or whatever so we refer them to those doctors and then if this doctor those doctors are pretty conservative too and if they put them on meds it is usually just for the school day not during the summer not over vacation not after five oclock not on the weekends and it is just to help them focus and then these doctors also ask for reports back from the teachers and if you do not see any appreciable difference in two or three weeks then you take the kid off and you try something else and some kids medication is like the difference between night and day you go back in observe the kid you can not believe it is the same kid other kids dead and face them they might as well be drinking a glass of water well since they have side effects like they stunt your growth and they subdue your appetite and some of the other you know some kids get headaches from dexedrine and adderall so i say you know if it works use it if it does not work just forget it but you know a lot of people feel that too many kids are on this stuff because they are maybe just not able to pay attention a little bit but they are not really add and the parents are taking them in and going johnny is not getting straight a is put him on something so i guess 

Recording: (6267/ 9621) 
i am sorry 

Recording: (6268/ 9621) 
i like it i have only lived in the northern end i have lived in dublin and old worthington and now hilliard which is kind of around the side but i like it because it has its own little well especially worthington its own little city within a city 

Recording: (6269/ 9621) 
20 years ago 

Recording: (6270/ 9621) 
mhm 

Recording: (6271/ 9621) 
well he uses it when he has like car problems or something he tends to like to drive his own car you know they have to park so far away 

Recording: (6272/ 9621) 
it is not going to work 

Recording: (6273/ 9621) 
yeah probably because we have some public systems most of them are for the librarians but there is some for public too 

Recording: (6274/ 9621) 
i love you 

Recording: (6275/ 9621) 
i think when you have two or more pets you have to make a little bit more effort 

Recording: (6276/ 9621) 
yeah it was pretty much upper middle class 

Recording: (6277/ 9621) 
i wonder if that is also a socialized medicine there it is socialized is not it 

Recording: (6278/ 9621) 
which was a going thing 

Recording: (6279/ 9621) 
i have a class at high school that is called grads and it is like all the kids in there are people that have kids 

Recording: (6280/ 9621) 
i have got nothing against christianity but i got something against the way it was brought here 

Recording: (6281/ 9621) 
yeah exactly 

Recording: (6282/ 9621) 
well they needed to strike do not get me wrong that is not the stupid part but the part was the majority of them saying that they were here for 10 years and they ai not making that much money most people would move on 

Recording: (6283/ 9621) 
yeah well the white man would probably win but the black man also has a better chance than the woman i think 

Recording: (6284/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6285/ 9621) 
them 

Recording: (6286/ 9621) 
you know what actually i do not believe they have anything booked so far a lot of times i think this year people are more going out rather than having people come into their homes and things i have usually i have worked for different hotels where i have always worked on new year is eve and my husband this year is like you know but we do not even have any plans we were gonna maybe do something with some friends and they are going to california so i am not sure even exactly what i am gonna do but right now there is not an event scheduled 

Recording: (6287/ 9621) 
no no really i mean different cultures and everything i went to school with blacks so i mean that was not that big a thing except for the influx of the you know i did not realize how many were being drafted or being enlisted into the service at the time and everything or how many actually were even in the country you know 

Recording: (6288/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6289/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6290/ 9621) 
and i mean yeah if they find the cause of it whatever that is good but at the same time the cause of it does not really matter i mean the fact of the matter is it is there they have to deal with it 

Recording: (6291/ 9621) 
media has a lot of control over people but i believe that sometimes people just need a kick like that 

Recording: (6292/ 9621) 
they did 

Recording: (6293/ 9621) 
see the thing is ideally i would rather if i were gonna buy houses in clintonville to hold them and rent them my problem is i do not have any money so that down payment has to be 10 down and so that means that i would have that tied up while i was being rented like we bought a couple condos over on bethel road for my kids to live in so my oldest girl when she was getting ready to move out she was like 24 and they could not find any place to live that i felt was safe and that was acceptable so i finally decided well we will find something and i will buy it and i will be your landlady and then it will be nice and so i bought that one and then my other daughter was thinking she was gonna move out when she graduated from high school and changed her mind so i just rented that one but the bottom line is i just got a second mortgage and i have a guy that i work with that helped me buy those without any money i did not have a down payment i had nothing so it is like i can afford to hang on to those because the rent just makes the payment but the other you would be fine you would be running you would not buy anything that you did not think you could rent and come out even with 

Recording: (6294/ 9621) 
you know i just got out of it 

Recording: (6295/ 9621) 
yeah and immigration from different countries and those people come in and they have got their input and i think that it is just a mixture of everything 

Recording: (6296/ 9621) 
and do not insult us anymore or we will go to trial so my attorney jumped it back up to $125000 i could not take sitting there these guys going back and forth of what they felt i was worth even the arbitrator was an asshole but that is the way that system works 

Recording: (6297/ 9621) 
okay my name is i am an undergrad double major in german and history currently working on a senior honors thesis in history i will be graduating next quarter after a grand total of six years as an undergrad an impressive somewhat disturbing six years as an undergrad i live in german village i like it here grew up here like it here i think of it as a big city having been to other big cities it feels more like that than small towns which i have also been to of course and 

Recording: (6298/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6299/ 9621) 
and there are no computer manuals for it so you have to figure it out totally on your own i am thinking i may get into that 

Recording: (6300/ 9621) 
yeah i am just learning the area but i like it so far it seems really nice it seems like there is a lot more to do in columbus obviously 

Recording: (6301/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (6302/ 9621) 
dezêmino 

Recording: (6303/ 9621) 
there is just too much diversity 

Recording: (6304/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (6305/ 9621) 
well i lived on 12th maybe about four or five years ago probably longer but that was just for a summer thing you know after i saw the couches being burned i said shoo no way 

Recording: (6306/ 9621) 
that was a lot of old thinking 

Recording: (6307/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6308/ 9621) 
i have seen this a thousand times now people fighting killing this murdered that murdered it is like the same thing over and over and over we just keep repeating and repeating our bad stuff instead of getting off of it 

Recording: (6309/ 9621) 
39 

Recording: (6310/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6311/ 9621) 
the first year they made it instate only the second class that they are going to be starting they have some people from michigan i think 

Recording: (6312/ 9621) 
i mean he was a funny guy he was a really nice guy but it took him a while to catch on to things 

Recording: (6313/ 9621) 
i remember it being a pretty positive thing for me i was never upset about the fact that they were not together because they both gave me a lot of attention i think i was maybe five or six when my mom moved into an apartment in german village 

Recording: (6314/ 9621) 
like i do not know it is like it is really serious and it is really not serious like it is everything i guess 

Recording: (6315/ 9621) 
hehe 

Recording: (6316/ 9621) 
so i think that part definitely helps whereas most of my other friends you know they are kind of lost they do not know exactly what they are doing where like i said i have already done all the stuff that we are doing now and know how to go about it 

Recording: (6317/ 9621) 
oh that is good that is good 

Recording: (6318/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (6319/ 9621) 
yeah i have a brother and two sisters 

Recording: (6320/ 9621) 
ha ha ha 

Recording: (6321/ 9621) 
all by yourself 

Recording: (6322/ 9621) 
a little bit faster but and then when i get out of the service like at 22 you know i was kind of like behind everybody you know as far as my age group and stuff that did not have to go and so i had a lot of good times as far as that goes and you know cleanliness and extra godliness and all that stuff you know i mean a lot of people do not there is just a lot of lax stuff goes on today in my opinion 

Recording: (6323/ 9621) 
like you mean sexual relationships and what probably the bad things about it yeah but just coming from my christian beliefs and whatnot the best thing and i know it even though i did not partake in it when i was a teenager and i was not promiscuous at all but i still had sex before marriage just to be it would be nice if they teach you how to be confident in yourself and i do not mean like selfesteem but you know like we said if you know you come from a situation like that that does not mean you have to be like that do you know what i mean kind of 

Recording: (6324/ 9621) 
and our engineers they are not engineers per se but they are techies that are really into this they enjoy their work and it is in the forefront of ohio government along with the technology there has to also be the paperwork now i do not realize we have a paperless environment quote unquote 

Recording: (6325/ 9621) 
i was in more north florida tallahassee around tallahassee so that is that is a little different i mean that is that is not that is more southern georgia basically i mean yeah it is not so touristy and they are the thing where you could not have any buildings bigger than the state capital because they did not want it to be like orlando or miami like miami especially so i was really interesting it was a different type of town like not so many palm trees more big oak trees and stuff like that yeah it is real it is more not all of us centralized downtown it is more of us like spreading out 

Recording: (6326/ 9621) 
even my mother she said if nixon were running today she would vote for him she is that much of a conservative agrees with what is happened but most people will say the same thing there should have been another way to get him out of there but at this point i do not think there really was a few months ago yeah 

Recording: (6327/ 9621) 
i am not sure i do not know his dad found it and told me about it because i was not working at the time and we were trying to get an extra income to come in and his dad made it actually like $25 or something i would think he would make more than that because the man every time we go over there he is up on the computer doing something and i am i am on there you know just i look up baby stuff get coupons and stuff you know like reading about things that happen to people like their kid spitting up in their face or something 

Recording: (6328/ 9621) 
would not you like him to see that you know look 

Recording: (6329/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6330/ 9621) 
i do not know i saw it in the paper some kid was suspended because he had a paper he drew a picture of a gun and cut it out 

Recording: (6331/ 9621) 
it is just out of your control and i mean like i said i mean that is sort of kids for you i mean they just obviously they are going to be curious about things and the parent definitely does have to be held responsible for it but i do not know to what degree that they should go with it 

Recording: (6332/ 9621) 
i mean if i would have chosen to do that conflict oh god my husband is a lot better at these type of questions because he was methodist and he chose to join catholic when we got married and his perception of the methodist religion and the catholic religion and the more i was exposed to his it is like boy these really are similar but yours is a lot looser than mine and you know it was you know just teaching him to be honest and open and being able to talk about sex and drugs and being there and open and keeping the lines of communication open and then it goes back to the family being available and doing meaningful things with the children 

Recording: (6333/ 9621) 
it is a lot cheaper than the us because the australian dollar is a lot weaker than the american dollar 

Recording: (6334/ 9621) 
you can not see it in a day 

Recording: (6335/ 9621) 
or anything like that i do smack his hands 

Recording: (6336/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6337/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6338/ 9621) 
yeah but you put up with that anywhere it is not just ohio state it would be anywhere you go you know it is just like i said you get excuse me you get assholes in 

Recording: (6339/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (6340/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (6341/ 9621) 
i do not know about that he has not shown that period yet i do not know if he is supposed to be showing it now or not because i mean when he goes to his aunt amy is you know bye mom look up okay bye that is it 

Recording: (6342/ 9621) 
she is doing alright as far as i know she is going to st louis university do not ask me why 

Recording: (6343/ 9621) 
but one time i read somewhere that a mexican lady who came across the border to have her baby and they put the little band on and they wrote female and then they wrote her last name she said to her husband when he came over to see her well they have already named her look femali 

Recording: (6344/ 9621) 
nah 

Recording: (6345/ 9621) 
well unfortunately i do not think it is fair but i think in the long run it does not have to be a college education because most of those people probably would not want a college education but like a trade or a skill or something that will give them a little bit of hope if they do want to choose to get a job instead of robbing a bank or selling drugs or whatever they did they have that choice it is is up in their head okay i can either go become a welder or i can have a gun i mean if they want a college education yeah it is it is not fair but for for you growing up and going into a lifestyle i would prefer having their colleges paid for and then being productive citizens than somebody robbing me someday because they did not get an education i mean that is a broad spectrum and i know it is not all that cut and dried yeah it would upset me but hopefully i would step back from it a little bit and go well maybe it is for the best yeah 

Recording: (6346/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6347/ 9621) 
well i will take for one thing when i was overseas if we wanted to do something we would wait till sergeant went and shed and we just put a padlock on the door so he could not get out 

Recording: (6348/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (6349/ 9621) 
mmhmm mmhmm 

Recording: (6350/ 9621) 
mmhmm yeah yeah it is been glamorized and they do not they do not value human life either i do not think because there is so much violence you know you can not watch tv and not seeing somebody get shot or something and it is just like it is not really real because it is you know you turn the channel and then you see the same actor doing something else you are like see it was not real and i do not think they i think i do not know 

Recording: (6351/ 9621) 
yeah and it has the least amount of people which is kind of neat as far as tourism so 

Recording: (6352/ 9621) 
yeah they like they really like this town she was from kentucky appalachia 

Recording: (6353/ 9621) 
no i do not go to mass every day but i go on sunday 

Recording: (6354/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6355/ 9621) 
um no english 

Recording: (6356/ 9621) 
but when you can not grow much of anything on it it is 

Recording: (6357/ 9621) 
no not really i mean i would have preferred it of course and i would prefer that she carried on the faith the same as the rest of the children did but no i am very happy and content with her decision and all of your grandchildren have they been raised yeah very much so as a matter of fact ironically julie the tulsa she and her husband both baptist they have both their children in a catholic prep school and yeah kindergarten and preschool and it is a yes it is a catholic school environment so it will be interesting to see what evolves from the children is attention to the roman catholic side of religion as compared to the baptists 

Recording: (6358/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6359/ 9621) 
oh well 

Recording: (6360/ 9621) 
this is a game we play every weekend it is an okay game monday night i usually come up with something dumb that needs to occur 

Recording: (6361/ 9621) 
we send them in and then the kids let us see the eighth graders take them in march and then we get the pay the scores back in may sometime and some of my kids well i have a group of kids that i had them when they were sixth graders and they just now graduated 

Recording: (6362/ 9621) 
i really hate that and like affirmative action stuff totally burns me up the idea is wonderful but it is just executed very poorly i mean i saw like during high school how easy it was for me to get into places i mean citadel was begging me to come 

Recording: (6363/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (6364/ 9621) 
oh yeah it is huge 

Recording: (6365/ 9621) 
well when i was growing up there was not that much violence and i could go in the end and i have done it my name ai not on this report so you can not do nothing about it 

Recording: (6366/ 9621) 
like that 

Recording: (6367/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6368/ 9621) 
why would you want to leave you said you were in third world country why would you want to leave the third world country i have been i would not want to this country has a lot of problems it is just like my family has a lot of problems why would i want to leave a family why would i want to leave the country why not work with it and correct it because when i run away from it you know what i am doing i am running into another chaos at the other end someone else coming the other direction and they have not resolved things and that is been happening in our society we have not sat down to learn and understand one another 

Recording: (6369/ 9621) 
oh that would be awesome 

Recording: (6370/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (6371/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (6372/ 9621) 
just different stuff it is different every day that is why i like it just like with you talking to people it is different every day 

Recording: (6373/ 9621) 
that is pretty extreme 

Recording: (6374/ 9621) 
but it fixed it 

Recording: (6375/ 9621) 
figures 

Recording: (6376/ 9621) 
it is available it is just whether they go and put forth the efforts 

Recording: (6377/ 9621) 
and so as soon as my shop found out that i could draw that a whole $90 a month 

Recording: (6378/ 9621) 
was it hard 

Recording: (6379/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6380/ 9621) 
i was born in new york 

Recording: (6381/ 9621) 
and i am saying i could take that route but it would cost me a lot of money that i do not have to get the legal defense and it would be just best for me to take the responsibility like i have and i sold the car that i had to my sister i am going to pay back the apartment complex that i signed a lease for but i am gonna make them come after me i already went to court once even with the evidence being in my favor i mean i was only at this place three months i did not do any damage to it the walls did not need painted i was not there long enough to make them dirty but their own person even went through on a first run through after i moved out and my mother and i cleaned that thing spotless top and bottom bathrooms washed the floors and mopped the floors and everything and their own person came through and said it rated the paint an a which meant according to their system a meant no 

Recording: (6382/ 9621) 
those are the formative years of a child 

Recording: (6383/ 9621) 
i think it has changed drastically and i think it is changing and i think it will also be changing in the future going all the way back finances were not a consideration in oh i would say probably my first 30 maybe 40 years there was some there was influence but i think the influence was not financial it was influence from the person who could get up here and talk with a group of people and sway them with his and i want to use the word opinion but i know that is not right he swayed them with a position that he had developed now that is not necessarily his opinion so i am trying to make a point there but he would sway them based upon the influences that he had had from various people within his community whether you are talking about a township or a county state whatever it may be and yes then slowly then i think the finances came into play and finances have come to a horrible horrible situation as of today and i will leave out the last two years because it is rather specific right now but going back to two years or four years ago finances were still a very very heavy consideration and not just on the national level but i am saying even on local levels i know within the immediate community there are people out there hey come on we will go to dinner we will go to this and we will do this and do this just barely barely breaking the barrier but not breaking the law so yes very definitely progressively has changed 

Recording: (6384/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6385/ 9621) 
ha ha ha ha 

Recording: (6386/ 9621) 
i do not think anyone really affected anyone too much as far as that goes 

Recording: (6387/ 9621) 
in a strange city i know oh my god 

Recording: (6388/ 9621) 
that was so funny 

Recording: (6389/ 9621) 
mmm 

Recording: (6390/ 9621) 
oh yeah oh yeah it used to be when i first started teaching even up to sixth grade kids were pretty respectful 

Recording: (6391/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6392/ 9621) 
yeah they are okay they are parents they are in their 70s now i take what i need and leave the rest because they have got their own opinions that are a lot different than mine 

Recording: (6393/ 9621) 
you know they do not understand the concept so they do not know any different of you know why did not we get to stay home they may later when they grow older but yeah but i still think you know they benefited a lot from it 

Recording: (6394/ 9621) 
i ever would have before 

Recording: (6395/ 9621) 
what is the point of staying married and being miserable i think it is better to get a divorce than 

Recording: (6396/ 9621) 
family experiences 

Recording: (6397/ 9621) 
yeah i mean i want to see how the season ends out it is just a lot of the ones this season to me have just been disappointing i mean i think every show sort of has a peak some shows peak towards the end some at the beginning and sort of level off the simpsons had a stretch from like their third year through like their seventh where things were just like unbelievably funny and then they had writing changes i think and this this season it is just it is been completely outrageous storylines and like the jokes are not as integrated into the story 

Recording: (6398/ 9621) 
like a girlfriend is mind 

Recording: (6399/ 9621) 
well they are now in a sense it is easier to go somewhere else i think in the web on tv if you have four local news channels and they are all saying the same thing and emphasizing the same things there is no choice there if you want the news you are going to get it one way or the other but on the web you can and you know major newspapers are all over the web you can pick and choose and you can see different perspectives on the same story from different parts of the country and i think you get a wider view 

Recording: (6400/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6401/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6402/ 9621) 
years ago there was a citizen i do not know if you were what your background is whether you were here or not but citizen journal was a daily paper and it was it was the opposite of the dispatch it was much more liberal they used this it was a morning paper and the dispatch was an afternoon paper evening paper and they shared the same facilities the same printing presses and everything and then dispatch when their lease expired would not renew their lease 

Recording: (6403/ 9621)

Recording: (6407/ 9621) 
i do not think they should i do not have any you know people are gay or you know that is their business but i do not think that is not how this world was they was not put you know it was a man and a woman to start out with i do not think they should encourage that you know maybe that is a hard topic for me to talk about because i do not know because i am sure there are gay boys that are not knowing what is going on with themselves that are in school and i have never really understood i never really understood if they were born like that or i just never really understood that to tell you the truth so i would not you know i would just if i was a teacher i would just talk to them and you know tell them to do whatever they feel i mean if they feel comfortable with being like that that is fine but i do not know i do not know if i would talk about the but maybe they should because there might be kids in school that are like that and they are like well what should i do 

Recording: (6408/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6409/ 9621) 
mmhmm mmhmm

than it is 

Recording: (6418/ 9621) 
and that the people who most face that lie are the supposed beneficiaries of civil rights legislation so i mean civil rights was an important step but once that step was made it was stopped and now i believe today there are i see a growing movement of people who want to who curtail the advances that were made in the 60s and it is not our generation who is curtailing it it is still our parents generation 

Recording: (6419/ 9621) 
wow 

Recording: (6420/ 9621)

i have no idea i remember where i was too in the columbine shooting because my friends and i were sitting around drinking a few beers and we are channel surfing and we see that kid fall out of the window and we are like oh my god what is going on so we just left it on it was quite disturbing because i was recently out of high school myself and sure there were fights and stuff but it was always like you could avoid them or you know what i mean 

Recording: (6426/ 9621)

Recording: (6429/ 9621) 
i at one time i kind of wanted to be a teacher and everything but of course that would have been i am 49 so i would have been probably what about 24 so i would have about 25 years in so i would be getting ready to get the heck out anyway 

Recording: (6430/ 9621) 
just say how you feel 

Recording: (6431/ 9621) 
she is real good yeah yeah everything is healthy and great and then my daughter i mean i think she is just going to be a real good influence she is a single mom and the father is in another relationship and probably on his way to be getting married and you know it does not look like he is going to be in the picture that much and she had trouble trying to decide whether she wanted him to be too so could you 

Recording: (6432/ 9621) 
my opinion well my opinion changes from day to day on who is fault it is actually at this point in time i do not know who is fault it is i think it is the fault of evolution well it could have been prevented but we did not know it was going to happen that our society was going to change so intensely and we kind of hung back and thought things would stay the same way they were and they have not everybody is changing especially the younger people and we were not ready and we did not change fast enough we did not get ready for the change that was coming 

Recording: (6433/ 9621) 
i talk to all my family my brothers and sisters every day 

Recording: (6434/ 9621) 
back to bed rest really 

Recording: (6435/ 9621) 
not specifically no sometimes little groups sometimes if there is a college in a community when i was running a school levy campaign we would try to get them either registered and active in a campaign but it was very difficult sort of like getting people who live in a trailer park active in voting there is certain little blocks of people and on school levies the people who voted no which were senior citizens i mean they went to the polls in droves you did not have to you know the hope there was that they would not go to vote on the school levy but actually trying to get college kids involved i have not really specifically done that as a whole campaign in and of itself it might be a little pocket of a campaign but nothing big 

Recording: (6436/ 9621) 
no no they did not they did not pay for grading or preparing your classes or researching anything so right but still even though it was a real very much underpaid job i liked it when i did it i liked the introduction to the arts class because i had to develop my own curriculum for it right they had a when they told me i they would hire me to teach this class they gave me a book that was about this thick and it was only about painting 

Recording: (6437/ 9621) 
a lot of pool actually we go to a bar called the outer inn because it is cheap and it is fun there 

Recording: (6438/ 9621) 
and as i say we went to church fairly regularly but to tell you the truth i can not remember too much that i was taught then but i was exposed to it anyway and i am sure that some of it rubbed off on me 

Recording: (6439/ 9621) 
i know 

Recording: (6440/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6441/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6442/ 9621) 
and they actually offered an early retirement because the funds you may not remember about three years ago four years ago the federal government was not gonna pass a budget and all this stuff so when that does not happen on budget cuts in at 75 of what the previous year budget was or something like that which was actually more money than they were gonna give us before that so they were either gonna lay off people or offer retirement so i took the retirement because i was not happy there anyway then took a couple months off and did some consulting i worked on a consulting project at borden is for about six months and then when that project ended just at the same time it ended my fatherinlaw was diagnosed terminally ill with cancer and he needed daily treatments here in columbus and they were from chillicothe so i became his caregiver for about three months until he died and then took a couple months off and started working parttime at the symphony i have been since then 

Recording: (6443/ 9621) 
expelling 

Recording: (6444/ 9621) 
right yeah we do not have a web browser version that is what we are working on now that is what i have been working on 

Recording: (6445/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6446/ 9621) 
like the people in japan do they are cheaper flying in than doing it at home oh my gosh 

Recording: (6447/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6448/ 9621) 
i mean i was very good in math very good in math i mean i did pretty good in all of the subjects 

Recording: (6449/ 9621) 
well i would assume you would be running it that whole time 

Recording: (6450/ 9621) 
my thing is you try to do your best on earth do the attributes you have whether it is supposed to be a missionary fine can you see a missionary working in the office there is need for missionary work in the offices around us on the campus every day you are talking about diversity here all you gotta do is just sit down it is not a numbers game it is not a numbers game at all just learn about one another and you are gonna find out you know what i think they said the colorblind society that is what we got to do when you are in a coma or when you are let us say you are out you can not see anything and you are doing surgery on you are you going to qualify well i want this surgeon to be this and that and that 

Recording: (6451/ 9621) 
so it is kind of hard you know what i mean to do a lot of things 

Recording: (6452/ 9621) 
mhm 

Recording: (6453/ 9621) 
affected me and i can not say that 

Recording: (6454/ 9621) 
yeah and everybody has it right 

Recording: (6455/ 9621) 
so i tighten this good it is like it is falling oh there it can go cool perfect 

Recording: (6456/ 9621) 
right but still my oldest daughter for a long time she was in theater and people would say how do you feel about that and i said what do you mean how i feel about that she can always wait tables as long as she can support herself what do i care and then she ended up getting an undergraduate degree in psychology and now as it turns out she is going to she just started back she is the one that is having the baby though she just started back to get certified to teach elementary school because we have talked so much about where would she do well and she would just do so well she is really good she is such a kid herself she is really good with kids maybe second third grade she is so into animals and so into science and understands different kids so that you know i think she would be fabulous there and so she is kind of decided but if that if she ends up not doing that i will not care either 

Recording: (6457/ 9621) 
the yeah 

Recording: (6458/ 9621) 
yeah you may be right could be could be 

Recording: (6459/ 9621) 
he was having problems with his adopted mother and he was in a an all night restaurant and he was bragging you know that he met this man and the man took him home you know he slept at the man is place and i was told do you know how dangerous that you know that could have been for you and he thought it was cool you know so you know just things like that 

Recording: (6460/ 9621) 
i think they have tried to bring the layman into more of the duties of the priest but there is like the consecration of the bread and wine none of that has been sanctioned they do not perform they are not able to give the sacramental graces for baptism confirmation holy well they do holy communion but extramunction matrimony none of those have been delegated outside of the duties of the priest but i still think that it is a good i do think the involvement of the layman is very important but i do not have any i mean that does not bother me a bit about women 

Recording: (6461/ 9621) 
if we ran sports i mean the game of sports not the administration the administration of sports is just as unethical as the business world it is unethical and it is one of the biggest problems we have in our society because we have emphasized sports along with a theater as being oh the way to go and the poorest benchmarks you could have in terms of financial appreciation sure the thing is the market demands the dollar that type of thing well yeah go ahead and do it but the thing is it gets almost to be like a lawsuit case we are crazy insane people again it gets back to ethics do you think i am worth $30 million let me ask you a question why in the hell are you coming and asking for $30 million do not you think you are uncouth 

Recording: (6462/ 9621) 
except for last year no i am just kidding 

Recording: (6463/ 9621) 
yeah actually they just posted something on the email today they have these old machines that used to be called 3b2s and att used to run on them 

Recording: (6464/ 9621) 
the one that is 18 now i thought he was going to be left handed up until he was like four because his dad is left handed my sister is left handed i have one left handed parent well all of a sudden one day he picked up a thing with the right hand and he is been with his right hand ever since so you really can not tell because they are pretty much either or until they are about five 

Recording: (6465/ 9621) 
my mother is go in get what you want get the heck out 

Recording: (6466/ 9621) 
i do because they were not in their children is lives enough they were not talking about things being open about things at dinner finding out about school you can not blame them for having a slide on the internet not too many parents would know that that their kids you know but no i think i put the blame on the parents 

Recording: (6467/ 9621) 
that is like a big thing you know they are saying when northland shopping center closed down and all that if you go up where i am at they got so many of them strip malls like you are talking about with stores out of them 

Recording: (6468/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6469/ 9621) 
yeah that is really a tough one because i think people are looking for easy answers and there is no easy answer i do not think it is violence on tv i do not think it is working parents i do not know what it is it seems to be something more pervasive than could be solved easily i do not know it is a tough one i mean your daughter his daughter is still young so you had to deal with it but it is scary you send your kids to school and you hear these things and it is just no matter where it is in the country or world you hear of it you know it really worries you 

Recording: (6470/ 9621) 
freshman sophomore year yes after that i quit wrestling and i just kind of found myself being myself instead of trying to be someone else sports is definitely part of a clique you try to be part of the team and the team tries to do everything the same 

Recording: (6471/ 9621) 
oh the japanese come too 

Recording: (6472/ 9621) 
and she goes well after i read the book i asked them a lot of questions so maybe they did not give it to you you know like we do not want to go through this again because she is a little older than me i thought that was hilarious 

Recording: (6473/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (6474/ 9621) 
i like computers 

Recording: (6475/ 9621) 
he was recovered he was about 34 years old 

Recording: (6476/ 9621) 
yeah but see that was coming from his friends more than him 

Recording: (6477/ 9621) 
oh yeah it is definitely weird 

Recording: (6478/ 9621) 
yeah i do not do a whole lot of it but i like to travel 

Recording: (6479/ 9621) 
me out 

Recording: (6480/ 9621) 
yeah the second thing would be the cultural activities that we have wexner center would be one of my primary ones because there is so much going on down there but the art museum and oh right that cultural arts center and columbus music hall i mean there is just a million things 

Recording: (6481/ 9621) 
i do not really like it very much because it is just a big city and i do not think it is a very interesting place to me actually it well at least you are honest about it you know is that right everything had grape upon that is fantastic and all the way backwards okay yeah did it did it that does not try to do the tourist thing she is always really rushed really why is that just because of the wall go visit a wall i think i remember that when they took down the wall the brandenburg gates or something like that okay i remember hearing that say hi 

Recording: (6482/ 9621) 
there should have been in class 

Recording: (6483/ 9621) 
just i think it is to reflect the beliefs that we are trying to carry because i think if someone showed up and looking like i mean i am not saying that it is terrible but if they had like a nose ring and all this stuff then somebody might not believe that they have anything credible to say and a lot of times if you are dressed more respectfully that to you know i mean most of the people will accept you if you are dressed in a dress whereas i mean even a person in a nose ring will respect you but then you are at a disadvantage if you do not dress in a certain way 

Recording: (6484/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6485/ 9621) 
but the more time i have offering no 

Recording: (6486/ 9621) 
well right now i think he knows enough i am just letting him be creative he loves playing with his legos and building things i am pretty i am like wow i can not even build the stuff that he builds he makes ships and cars and rockets and 

Recording: (6487/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6488/ 9621) 
they definitely struggle i think to be that high up obviously you are going to come in contact with powerful people rich people and things like that but i think at least even if the democrats do have that same thing they seem to keep more in mind the i do not think they represent working class you know guy either but at least more so than the republicans so like i said best out of a bad bunch i would probably 

Recording: (6489/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6490/ 9621) 
you should be real attentive to what is happening in his school situation his or her 

Recording: (6491/ 9621) 
so she is and hopefully they will get married soon they have been together for over a year and a half 

Recording: (6492/ 9621) 
you know why 

Recording: (6493/ 9621) 
oh lots of people travel all over lots of people do they do shows on christmas if they had them but i do 10 12 a year 

Recording: (6494/ 9621) 
and neither one of these folks could answer yes or no and they are going just answer yes or no that is all you well i think i stated my point very clearly when i was no the answer is yes it was health care for livein partners it is a simple question yes or no how do you stand on this issue and it just drives me nuts that and i know that from want to you do not want to shun any people away that might vote for you because you feel like that dammit you know if you are running for office you should just just be upfront 

Recording: (6495/ 9621) 
i am not saying that it is not right for some people but you know it was not right for my son 

Recording: (6496/ 9621) 
oh they do like what 

Recording: (6497/ 9621) 
right right 

Recording: (6498/ 9621) 
too much 

Recording: (6499/ 9621) 
it really is great 

Recording: (6500/ 9621) 
i know 

Recording: (6501/ 9621) 
and i looked at it and i thought introduction to the arts to me means something a lot broader than that so i ended up coming up with a class that was it was only nine weeks it was only nine classes so it was about a two and a half or three hour class each week for nine weeks and i ended up coming up with a curriculum where for the first three weeks we talked about painting mostly and visual art and for the second three weeks we talked about music and the development of music various aspects and for the last three weeks we talked about theater actually for the two of the last three weeks we talked about theater and for the last week we talked about musical theater and opera so for a lot of these kids you know from it was an introduction to a lot of things that they might not have been exposed to yeah 

Recording: (6502/ 9621) 
outer in is over i do not even know like 

Recording: (6503/ 9621) 
lsu 

Recording: (6504/ 9621) 
but i am using me as an example because i have seen a lot of other people do the same thing do not get me wrong 

Recording: (6505/ 9621) 
i think that the 

Recording: (6506/ 9621) 
mhm 

Recording: (6507/ 9621) 
it is beautiful and we like going to see the ski resorts and everything i do not really ski 

Recording: (6508/ 9621) 
catholic schools 

Recording: (6509/ 9621) 
well yeah but let us face it people that have the real good guns are the people that should not have the guns meaning crime and whatnot i do not have a problem with people having guns but we do not need 60 guns per person or whatever the ratio is it is something ungodly like that and they keep making them i mean yeah there was a time it was a part of our culture we did need to hunt to eat i have friends that bow and arrow hunt i am not real big into hunting but at least they are they have to do something besides sit there and 

Recording: (6510/ 9621) 
my husband lived in a town a small town in southern ohio where the dentists in town were three brothers and they were named payne payne and payne dentists and it was spelled payn there is some funny name stories out there boy but people just go nuts with their kids names i just like would you wanna why would you do that to that kid carol harold 

Recording: (6511/ 9621) 
well i 

Recording: (6512/ 9621) 
where you are from you say 

Recording: (6513/ 9621) 
i said yep i said you caught mommy saying a bad word and you got soap in your mouth yep so i go in the bathroom now what i always tell the kids was stick your tongue out and i just put a little bit of soap on the end of their tongue well now i have been i have had false teeth since i was about 32 needless to say i had false teeth when this kid did this she is only about five years old go in the bathroom i sit down on that toilet stool and i sit there i stick out my tongue she takes that cake of soap she does not rub my tongue she twists it it got on my teeth and it took me almost two weeks to get that soap taste off my teeth no matter how i scrub needless to say if i begin to get impatient after that and i am ready to say something i am looking around to see if there is anything 

Recording: (6514/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (6515/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6516/ 9621) 
ah okay okay it is part of growing up i have been there done that too but still you have to know there is respect out there to be warranted and expected and not just demand it you have to work to show respect and then you should get respect for it but then they saw the interaction with the elderly people the school he went to there is a lot of public involvement public service required the teachers i often ask the teachers i have gone to sporting events and there are teachers that are there ticket takers monitoring the crowd wherever the kids i ask them i said do you guys ever go home they said no oh yeah but they are always there they are not there just teaching a class they are not there preparing a class they are there after the class they are there for the student and they make the student feel part of the family that is a continuation of my philosophy at home we interact the school is great you have people that are on the clock whoop time to quit they are gone those people do not know the meaning of life they will never know the meaning of life but if they stay around try to extend themselves a little more with somebody that is having problems at work and are willing to work with that person i say willing to work not knowing they are going to be compensated because they will be compensated not necessarily materialistically they will be then when they are expected they will be recompensated somewhere but the thing is to lend an open hand not knowing well gee what is what is in it for me or what is in it for you is intangible are you willing 

Recording: (6517/ 9621) 
i never thought of that 

Recording: (6518/ 9621) 
but i think kids in high school and stuff some of them like my brotherinlaw is gay and when i met him i knew he was he was the type some of them you can not tell it does not matter what they look like but my husband said all through growing up he liked men he did not like girls he looked at magazines all this stuff and i thought that is so funny because growing up did not know anybody that was but you know he was openly gay to his mother right from the beginning and she was from germany which made it a little tough because you know they did not talk about those things over there at all for a long time but then she became very open with him and everybody knew and that was in the 80s and you know if some kids know it when they are young and growing up you know i do not know if it is best to not say it or to you know be open but if they are open to their parents about it then their parents are going to deal with it a lot better than if they wait later on in their life you know but sometimes i guess they change you know most of the men i knew right off the bat it was all through their life it wasn t as though they just said oh i m going to be gay 

Recording: (6519/ 9621)

Recording: (6526/ 9621)

Recording: (6533/ 9621) 
i was trying to avoid that question rewind no but i thought you know just get a little insight on what is going on out there in delaware and you know maybe possibly find someone to be with 

Recording: (6534/ 9621) 
i know there is somebody who says well you can even go to vietnam now i am like but why would i it is like yeah you can go now to cuba but why would you it is still it is so beautiful it is so it is not industrialized it is still really it is like a pastime it is like going back in time it can be a bad thing conveniences you know like toilets and the hot water you know oh really no they do not have like your basic amenities amenities really where is it in are they like are not they like are not the hostels supposed to be like dormitories or you know just you know they just provide your basics but they are supposed to be like at least you know i mean you get what you pay for okay okay but it is more of the that was more the exception than the norm so where in europe did you go where would you well actually where would you not recommend going okay 

Recording: (6535/ 9621) 
you know and they some of them spoke out where they should speak out 

Recording: (6536/ 9621)

Recording: (6537/ 9621)

Recording: (6538/ 9621) 
right kind of the usa today syndrome 

Recording: (6539/ 9621) 
like the continent 

Recording: (6540/ 9621) 
and as long as the wind was not too high well they could do it i mean they fogged it up to where you could hardly see your hand out here 

Recording: (6541/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6542/ 9621) 
i have lived in columbus my entire life 34 years born and raised on the west side of columbus 

Recording: (6543/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6544/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (6545/ 9621) 
and i think that the morals being you know especially at a young age you know abstinence is the best policy so many people i think they are turning to they are not going to have anything do anything before they are married but in today is life once you get into college and stuff it is a little hard to but i think a lot more kids are going that route because my parents never talked to me about sex we all learned it from our friends my mother was very open but i think in today is world because really there was not that many diseases i mean you know there was but you just did not hear about it 

Recording: (6546/ 9621) 
people are more scared of you than you are of them 

Recording: (6547/ 9621) 
are they really 

Recording: (6548/ 9621) 
the exercise i do a lot of walking anyway and swimming and stuff in the summer so 

Recording: (6549/ 9621) 
that is true 

Recording: (6550/ 9621) 
this was something that i would have done on monday night 

Recording: (6551/ 9621) 
not that valuable but that is what they thought though you get it for free and then you prove up on it as they say you build buildings a house and barn so that you can live on it and i think i do not know i suppose farm a certain amount of it i mean put in wheat or whatever and then after five years you get a title to it it is yours so they thought well gee you know free land to a farmer so they went out there but dad said in the 11 years that they were out there they only raised three or four crops 

Recording: (6552/ 9621) 
oh did you really 

Recording: (6553/ 9621) 
oh i take the little ladies i take the church 

Recording: (6554/ 9621) 
the shot 

Recording: (6555/ 9621) 
so how do they 

Recording: (6556/ 9621) 
we have not done that much yet because his family lives in albuquerque new mexico 

Recording: (6557/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6558/ 9621) 
the catholic church is the first christian church and all the others are fragments they want to be they still tie back to it but then it is like the commitment i was telling you well i would like to but could you make a little extra give me two more minutes to make that field goal oh yeah we will give you a little okay then we will start our own league up here and we will recognize all this stuff but then we are going to to two extra minutes in our rules okay we will get a league this way and so forth so we we develop things as they accommodate to our own selfish beings not to the sacrifice of what we should be doing and we are all mortal and we are all gonna be in that and i am not saying no one makes those errors makes errors it is always there the problem is to try to stay focused on that not to jump ship you know they say in this country oh you do not like it leave it 

Recording: (6559/ 9621) 
then have it executed as it is now 

Recording: (6560/ 9621) 
no more than five because there is a specific it is called the five paragraph essay the first paragraph is your introduction and the final one is your conclusion and the three in the middle is the body that develops your idea so i am teaching all my kids right 

Recording: (6561/ 9621)

locked in now so you know i will be 48 when i retire from here and i will be able to go out in the workplace and feel like i have gotten good education and work skills from working here for this long and you know they have definitely paid for classes for me so i do not know what their big gripe is for education when they are striking and all this because i have never had a problem if you want to take a class we get classes we can take anything we want so 

Recording: (6569/ 9621) 
should not you have a little more knowledge a little more support around you educating knowing selfdiscipline and what is really crazy is when you have multiple fathers and the children do not know the dads 

Recording: (6570/ 9621)

right right there i studied music and chemistry and ended up with a double major bachelor is degree there not doing really the same time 

Recording: (6580/ 9621) 
yeah oh yeah and i always use it as a decoration on the bed but i think that that is a lot of the main problem really 

Recording: (6581/ 9621) 
this will be and and the guy came back the next time and he said yeah i had a real good weekend you know it is a good idea and it is true if you show each other over and over that they are really you are really value them it just keeps coming back to you 

Recording: (6582/ 9621) 
now we are busy 

Recording: (6583/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (6584/ 9621) 
oh my gosh 

Recording: (6585/ 9621) 
you know they talk about drinking from the fountain now they are only gargling they are not drinking much by the time they get to be fourth or fifth grade they are pretty savvy these days they are not too scared to tell you where to go and what to do 

Recording: (6586/ 9621) 
yeah it is really expensive but that is why i went there for now i would not go there it was actually my last choice for universities but i went there because the price 

Recording: (6587/ 9621) 
there are things about my dad that i would not want to live with he is great and he is wonderful to me my dad is really wonderful to me but things like when my mom had me he did not pick her up from the hospital it is that kind of stuff that you think what the hell were you thinking 

Recording: (6588/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (6589/ 9621) 
yeah i was really glad that my son you know was introduced to them or brought in or whatever they do because you know the guys are real real nice you know very it is very you know he is always kind of been like real standoffish when it comes to 

Recording: (6590/ 9621) 
i like that aspect i do not pay attention to who the writers are so maybe the writing has changed 

Recording: (6591/ 9621) 
yeah aw yeah 

Recording: (6592/ 9621) 
heh heh heh 

Recording: (6593/ 9621) 
yeah yeah yeah yeah so 

Recording: (6594/ 9621) 
you know it is you know 

Recording: (6595/ 9621) 
i was a little bit on the piss side yeah 

Recording: (6596/ 9621) 
well i do not know the people that i see around you know they are grownups 

Recording: (6597/ 9621) 
middle 

Recording: (6598/ 9621) 
mmmm 

Recording: (6599/ 9621) 
right which is what we look like 

Recording: (6600/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (6601/ 9621) 
okay good because i do not think i would know that one whatever looks pretty when it comes out 

Recording: (6602/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (6603/ 9621) 
hehehehe 

Recording: (6604/ 9621) 
yeah which cracks me up because if you have ever looked at the parents of models they are not necessarily all that attractive yeah 

Recording: (6605/ 9621) 
it 

Recording: (6606/ 9621) 
i know that is why you have to get it recorded it would be nice to have more than one concert but they just they are on a shoestring they really are they get most of their money i think by well probably if you count inkind contribution otterbein college pays for our rehearsal space our performance space and the salary of the conductor so that is a huge amount of money that they put into it and what we have to give them in return is an opportunity for people to play in an orchestra so sometimes we have college students play in the orchestra especially string players because they do not have a college orchestra but once in a while we will get wind players play in it also and sometimes it leads to a little bit of friction when they get to play something you wanted to play 

Recording: (6607/ 9621) 
no she still lives down here my other sister has two niece and my nephew 

Recording: (6608/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6609/ 9621) 
that is an embarrassment for a college this size 

Recording: (6610/ 9621) 
i am and they are my wife was not 

Recording: (6611/ 9621) 
it is all up to that human being if they want to change if they got their mindset on they do not want to be with their other sex i do not think you can change them that is all up to that person i think 

Recording: (6612/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6613/ 9621) 
i have made them time out well now for two minutes 

Recording: (6614/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6615/ 9621) 
i am a mean kid 

Recording: (6616/ 9621) 
i do not know because i have not kept in contact with them i know of a couple that have 

Recording: (6617/ 9621)

Recording: (6618/ 9621)

Recording: (6620/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6621/ 9621) 
yeah yeah ever authority figures at all you know she is really strong about that though because she does not look at anybody being you know maybe more wise or experienced in things but you know certainly she does not trust anybody 

Recording: (6622/ 9621) 
yes but you know what his parents are going to you know really going to let people know that 

Recording: (6623/ 9621) 
what are the taxes are they high or 

Recording: (6624/ 9621) 
and you said divorce is more acceptable divorce should never be acceptable 

Recording: (6625/ 9621) 
kids because they are only little ones that is what i tell myself when i get really really frustrated they are only little ones and they will be grown up before i know it because 

Recording: (6626/ 9621) 
i did not need to so i did not want to 

Recording: (6627/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (6628/ 9621) 
and i do have a brother 

Recording: (6629/ 9621)

Recording: (6630/ 9621) 
and just get out there and have fun and then we lift probably four days a week i know i do not look like it but i go with them and have a good time 

Recording: (6631/ 9621) 
really that is awesome 

Recording: (6632/ 9621) 
do it the hard way or the easy way well i think everybody should have to do it the hard way i mean frankly i think a lot of people get married without thinking enough about it 

Recording: (6633/ 9621) 
he is a picky eater which he yeah he does not like everything 

Recording: (6634/ 9621) 
computers that figured it out just zip zip and then we had to locate our positions on a map 

Recording: (6635/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (6636/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6637/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6638/ 9621) 
um well as far as my mom issues realm of the catholic faith and i mean she made me always go to church and things like that 

Recording: (6639/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6640/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6641/ 9621) 
you will 

Recording: (6642/ 9621) 
i would say we do at least an hour or more a day something like that 

Recording: (6643/ 9621) 
you know you have to you know you do not have a choice but at the same time you do not want them to suffer but you want to keep them it is whoops oops i hope i did not move 

Recording: (6644/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6645/ 9621) 
or like the art shows in worthington or the crafts or even the irish festival in dublin which can be free on certain days and things like that the concerts on the river or on the worthington green really anything like that 

Recording: (6646/ 9621) 
if they hold enough of my views i am not gonna vote for a woman just because they are a woman and i am not gonna vote for a democrat just because they are a democrat they better have at least and i do not need 100 agreement with my views but i would like to be it in the 90 to 95 range but i do not tend to vote straight party line either as i said i have moderated from when i was in college to today part of the aging process and also partly because i have noticed that to get things done you have to have a center and it is the center that tends to rule when i was in college we had a bumper sticker that said america fix it or forget it and some of the construction people in dayton came out with one that said america love it or leave it and today i realize that both of those positions are wrong it is america love it and fix it just like with your kids you love your kids but you do not let them have bad manners at the table and you do not let them run around with the wrong kids and you want them to behave well that is how i see america now and america is become more centrist and when it deviates from that either way that is when people become upset so i just think it is important i remember when who was the other president that i voted for that won carter black leaders would meet with him once a week and then they would come out and hold this press conference and complain about he did not do this for blacks and he did not do that enough for blacks and he did not do this and he did not do that and i used to say to some of my black friends do not you see what you are doing do not you see the greater implications of this oh no we need to have him move faster i said you know that would be great in an ideal world this is not an ideal world you have to take it a step at a time whether you like it or not i said what you are going to do is you are going to make it look like he is so bad on all the issues you are going to give people a reason to vote against him then if any big issue comes up that is just going to be added to everything else i said what you need to do is after you have this meeting with him is come out and praise him and that he is doing a good job and that we are moving along steadily and i do not think sometimes people who do politics of the negative understand what it means i made that mistake when i was president of the dayton education association we were trying to get a levy passed so we went around as teachers showing all of the bad conditions in the school all of the leaking you know ceilings all of the peeling floors all of the bad chalkboards with cracks in them and all that kind of stuff and it had the opposite effect of what we thought people thought the schools were so bad they said we are not gonna support those and they voted no so the next time we did an opposite check we went in and we said 18 months later when the board put another levy on the ballot we said these are great schools we have great teachers look at this kid he is learning to read he is made six months improvement in three months and all that kind of it was image and we were saying the same thing we wanna continue this we wanna make even this better we learn to say the negatives in a positive way and that is important you know and you need to get that you need to appeal to the center americans do not like extreme liberals they do not like extreme conservatives you know they want they want peace 

Recording: (6647/ 9621) 
oh gosh 

Recording: (6648/ 9621) 
and union is not going to do that 

Recording: (6649/ 9621) 
it was on national news you see i am not that informed on that 

Recording: (6650/ 9621) 
mhm 

Recording: (6651/ 9621) 
yeah yeah i want to 

Recording: (6652/ 9621) 
definitely yeah like i said i do not have parts no different 

Recording: (6653/ 9621) 
i am trying to figure out what else to tell you i worked here at the university 24 years 

Recording: (6654/ 9621) 
it definitely did because i would sleep probably the eight hours right after practice until i woke up in the morning 

Recording: (6655/ 9621) 
and then there is columbus 

Recording: (6656/ 9621) 
i have never known of him 

Recording: (6657/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (6658/ 9621) 
yep well for so long i ate peanuts and i loved them and peanut butter and then two years ago i started getting a reaction from it and finally i did go to the doctor because i was so ill from it and he said you are allergic mainly it was the skins on like spanish peanuts and things and i never but my body must have built up this reaction to it because i was always fine eating them and then they really turned on me so now i can not even eat any peanut products or the oil because everybody is like well you can eat natural peanut butter i am like no it is the oil in there they grind up the peanuts and it is the oil but i probably had it for a long time and i was getting sick and thinking i had the flu or something 

Recording: (6659/ 9621) 
well i think a little bit safer idea than eliminating guns because you know there is always going to be weapons out there instead of eliminating the problem you know more centralize it make it a national law that you have to be a certain age give a certain time period for your background checks and whatever else kind of record finding they need make sure you are you know not going to just go out and blow somebody is head off for no reason you are keeping it for you know just either security reasons hunting reasons or practice you know but 

Recording: (6660/ 9621) 
oh okay 

Recording: (6661/ 9621) 
아

Recording: (6668/ 9621) 
yeah the other way around is probably even harder 

Recording: (6669/ 9621) 
i am just saying the honors would be better just because of the smaller class size i have like 400 in my class right now 

Recording: (6670/ 9621)

beethoven i think it was beethoven that did not talk until he was like seven they thought he was retarded but you see these people just their brains wire differently than ours is and you just you can not ever expect them to approach any problem like you would because they will not it just does not seem logical to them they are usually real good at puzzles they are usually real good at you know things that manipulatives things that do not take words things that you just have to solve by just manipulating things around yeah 

Recording: (6681/ 9621)

Recording: (6731/ 9621)

Recording: (6732/ 9621) 
it has not gone as far as loan sharking but the thing of it is it is fun when you win and it is still fun when you lose 

Recording: (6733/ 9621) 
and just you know sort of doing the same old same old every day there was always something different i have to be outside and it was just a lot easier to do 

Recording: (6734/ 9621) 
it is more our society than the guns i believe it is more the person that would have the gun than the gun itself

Recording: (6740/ 9621) 
if not you just get there the regular rooms are still nice and they have showers and stuff but it is interesting because the way they advertise it they make it sound like there is this huge place and you are going to get that no matter what and this and that but when you actually go and look around it kind of 

Recording: (6741/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6742/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6743/ 9621) 
yeah and i would not do that if i had no children 

Recording: (6744/ 9621)

mbc 뉴스 김지경입니다 

Recording: (6748/ 9621) 
boy you know not having kids not being that close to it it is hard to know i mean i have always thought that what their friends did and what they were exposed to at home had as much influence as anything that the school could do but i know the school is a very powerful force in a kid is life you know i mean it is a kid is life 

Recording: (6749/ 9621) 
well it is kind of hard see he is got two other kids and one kid he had while we was together that he does not see at all 

Recording: (6750/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6751/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6752/ 9621) 
well how he felt and knowing that we were not neglecting him are two different things we have always emphasized that knowing what is right or knowing that what is just is one thing is dealing with the emotions is another one 

Recording: (6753/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6754/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6755/ 9621) 
no not at all i would have rather voted for mccain over bush because bush he comes from a political family which i am not saying is wrong because the kennedys were a big political family but i am saying like bush was he just seems like he did not really like everything is been handed to him in life and the issue of whether he did drugs not that that is a big issue but i do not like the way he addressed it that to me if you did drugs okay everyone might experiment or try or make a mistake but the way he is handling it saying i am not even going to dignify that question over and over and over if he did not do it he might as well just be like no i did not do it 

Recording: (6756/ 9621) 
no actually i was going to get my ged after that 

Recording: (6757/ 9621) 
yeah with all the controversy about that and polaris i do not know northland is such a good location for all the people around there and it is certainly not a neighborhood that people do not need the shopping so i did not see the difference of having both i mean there is lazarus everywhere there is sears everywhere why not have it both places i mean i would not particularly go up to polaris if they take northland but we are not planning on staying there anyway so i did not yeah we will probably move within the year 

Recording: (6758/ 9621)

again gets back to being in the home did your mother give you everything you wanted then she failed you did not she 

Recording: (6762/ 9621) 
and of course i think too as in america the farm families you know they wanted that was more labors for the vineyards so to speak so i think that might have influenced a lot of that but over the years it just made sense to me in fact it looks like in my family that the children are going to be mostly in twos you know not even going to three or four i mean it is not over yet but my girls are 42 and 41 soon to be 41 so i think that their childbearing years are over 

Recording: (6763/ 9621) 
i know i wish i knew how to sew i can do buttons that is about it 

Recording: (6764/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (6765/ 9621)

attention deficit hyperactive disorder 

Recording: (6767/ 9621) 
now there is a lot of people good at church that are not worth anything too you know so i do not really believe that going to church you know makes you a better human being than another human being i believe that most people is basic structure in life if it is based similar to the bible or you could say buddhism or whatever you know that you will tend to have a better life than you will if you practice nonquoteunquote religious ways but i do not believe somebody going to church makes them a better human being than the next person because there is a lot of hypocrites that go to church these kids i think more just more than anything else i mean one thing i remember hearing a lot about too was what they were picked on 

Recording: (6768/ 9621) 
and subsequently lost my job after that and things got difficult more and more difficult i was unable to work full time i am doing some part time work right now working with people with mental illness but it is you know the thing i am running into out there is that nobody wants to pay you to do anything i do not understand that and then when they do want you to do something they abuse the hell out of you you know they give you a pager a cell phone and they want to know where you are morning noon and night seven days a week and it is none of their business so the frustrations with trying to find an adequate job and an adequate employer that understands my situation and how i operate and will give me freedom to do what i can do i have a bachelor of arts in communications but it is been more of a problem than it is been an asset interviewing for jobs people that were doing the interviewing had just a high school education and they are not gonna hire me when after a year i would be their boss so a lot of that is out there regardless of what people say i am not trying to be pessimistic or negative it is just been my experience unfortunately i hope it gets better but like i said i have not been ever told that my degree matters by any employer contrary to what the news tells you and what people will tell you oh go get that college degree people told me as soon as i got out of college that i needed a master is and then they said and after you get your master is you will definitely need your doctorate well you know the people saying this are college people college is a business and it takes a while to realize that if you can get in and get that education on grant money and scholarships that is good but then even now being a person with a semidisability from a brain injury i mean i do not even like to call it a disability i have different abilities now same abilities i used to do but i have to do them a different way just because my brain functions on a different level and i can not explain that to anybody and i should not have to but i am always forced to but trying to find a job you know resulting from this has been difficult and i am not giving up hope or nothing like that i am just trying to cut through and see what i can do and there is just it is very limited out there you know and your education is an asset but like i said even as a person now going through bvr i am discriminated against in my opinion because i have a bachelor is in other words bureau of vocational rehabilitation which is a government funded organization geared toward helping people with disabilities get back to work and because i already have a bachelor is they will not pay for school now if i were stupid you know if i just had a basic just got out of grade school and did not even have my ged boy they would pay for my high school my college and everything you know even living expenses you know but because i have a bachelor is nothing you know 

Recording: (6769/ 9621)

Recording: (6787/ 9621) 
and he paid for it when he got to college it was rough for him to start out because he was behind then 

Recording: (6788/ 9621) 
yeah i think every college does

Recording: (6794/ 9621) 
i went to brookhaven which is up on carl road near north le mans

Recording: (6798/ 9621) 
and that split second i was like okay he is gonna do this to me he is gonna do this to my kids 

Recording: (6799/ 9621)

Recording: (6801/ 9621) 
there are some foreign activities classes or foreign type culture classes or foreign understanding classes 

Recording: (6802/ 9621) 
well my oldest one is really odd because the school she goes to it is sort of like thrift store chic and a lot of kids there go to thrift stores and buy their clothes and i told i said you know we are not in the poorhouse you are not buying clothes at the thrift store so she basically went through my closet and took everything that was old of mine and wore it and i thought oh my gosh you know because she just looks like a bum i think and you know when it was time for like a dance or something she would go out and buy a dress you know at penny is or someplace at the mall you know and maybe spend like $80 for a dress and the same thing would happen every time she would go and come home i would go what did they say you know about your dress and she goes jelena is that you and i go see you clean up really nice i said you know you have the best shape you are ever going to have in your life and what do you do you wear these big baggy clothes and these saggy pants i said you know when you get in your 50s and you have got a gut and a big ass you know you could do that 

Recording: (6803/ 9621) 
and so 

Recording: (6804/ 9621) 
and then like people who work go back until like you know maybe two to six the kids are done with school for the day at like 12 or one 

Recording: (6805/ 9621) 
in the elementary school library we focus on sex so much in our society i think and part of family life so sex is such a small part of family life you know i mean especially with the elementary school kids i mean it is just is there milk and cookies after school 

Recording: (6806/ 9621) 
but we go out and look at we do it differently in sports but we do this differently in the secular world

Recording: (6810/ 9621) 
i am working here but workstudying 

Recording: (6811/ 9621)

to me if you are going to enforce the gun laws and make them stricter what you ought to do is put a limit on the barrel length and stuff on guns if you get caught with a gun with a barrel smaller than eight inches you go to jail 

Recording: (6853/ 9621)

Recording: (6878/ 9621) 
i know that they changed it i know that it used to just be one day i guess because of the health care something like that i feel like a day and a half certainly would be long enough for me i mean unless there is some type of complications i would be perfectly ready to go home you know unless there is something extra that they could do for me there 

Recording: (6879/ 9621) 
i used to fish and stuff like that but i have had skin cancer i have had poor heart attacks and if you look at my skin now you see all the blisters and stuff on it

Recording: (6881/ 9621) 
mmhmm you know even within marriage it is just like taboo yeah 

Recording: (6882/ 9621) 
i do not really care why should i yeah but you still just think well because i am thinking too so what happens when they die am i going to be feeling bad that this and i but i can not my sister said look you know you are not going to change and i am not the reason he will not come to my house is because when he goes to their house everything changes they have to have dinner at 10 oclock in the morning we are not doing that we are going to compromise and we will do it at one oclock we will do it at noon we have dinner at 7 oclock at night right we will do it at noon i am not doing it at 10 oclock in the morning i do not care and there is no compromise with him you have to compromise 

Recording: (6883/ 9621) 
really okay i did not know there was like a ripple effect for a stir i thought you know being so remote you know 

Recording: (6884/ 9621) 
but i am mainly an artist i work in pen and ink and colored pencil and do mainly humorous sort of things cartoony things 

Recording: (6885/ 9621) 
it does 

Recording: (6886/ 9621) 
a lot of my kids do much better with writing on the computer because they know that they can go back and change it or fix it or they can get spelling help or they can even get grammar help or they can maybe even get syntax help if it says this is awkward or something turn the sentence around so my students do a lot better with writing if they do it on the computer than if they are asked to do it pencil and paper so that is what i make them do they are webbing you know what a webbing is do not you where you web out an idea 

Recording: (6887/ 9621) 
historically you know my dad is people were democrats but then they turned republican because they thought they were supposed to turn republican i guess but you know there is some of the conservative values that are very important to me you know but then there is some social things that are real important too 

Recording: (6888/ 9621) 
you can go anywhere get something to drink 

Recording: (6889/ 9621) 
ground up bone so my mom was working and it is going to sound sickening i was 12 years old i would even have to come home from school and stick suppositories up on 

Recording: (6890/ 9621) 
you just get sent wherever 

Recording: (6891/ 9621) 
she was mary is mother was a kind of a freethinking not a liberal but well she went out when she was in her early 20s went out to north or south dakota one or the other in homestead 

Recording: (6892/ 9621) 
you are here for a reason and you are here in the united states for a reason of all the beatitudes you have here do not you think it is time to share some of those things the talent and to not necessarily be recognized for those things but some personalities require personalities it is the way it is but to do things without expecting something in return that would be so nice to see that written on magazine fronts oh yeah yeah yeah wow what is good in life you know if we can teach people to think the way you are trying to tell me well businesses tell us we should do it then why does not business take a more social correctiveness not political correctness yeah they will not increase until the tax law revises itself again to up the deduction allowances because even when we reduced deductions it went down too yeah 

Recording: (6893/ 9621) 
i moved to louisville kentucky 

Recording: (6894/ 9621) 
i was marathon training and i only got up to about 9 miles and i have unfortunately about 50 pounds of extra weight on me but even like i said when i was skinnier i have like a bum knee on distance i am okay to run the lower but 

Recording: (6895/ 9621) 
yeah they do let is see you have to complete either a thesis or a contract which consists of taking lots of honors classes 

Recording: (6896/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (6897/ 9621) 
i would like to move to mount sterling or something like that 

Recording: (6898/ 9621) 
yeah i do not think that though you know women need to work and most families do need two incomes and plus when kids go into high school you know you have to worry about them but you know you have to let them experience some of life on their own 

Recording: (6899/ 9621) 
i got one sister 

Recording: (6900/ 9621) 
well that basically is there you know as your influx of people move out of city limits and everything you know then you know you have got to have places for them to shop and everything and basically the northland mall is been there forever jacob who owned indians owned it he never did anything to it you know so you got your lazarus your penny is and mainstay places that generally moved there because of the years ago because it was something well it was right there with a lot of people population and everything and then like i say if you are gonna be good basically the people moving out to get away from the traffic and all that stuff you know not that they are moving away from it they are still getting into it but just your perspective on then you have to if you build it they will come they say you know and i guess he is still gonna build it so 

Recording: (6901/ 9621) 
some of them are pretty good at that some of them are not too some of them like when you have them copy like from this box down to this box these little shapes in a certain amount of time if their visual perception is messed up they screw that all up they you know the form goes this way they draw it this way their brain flips it around on them that is why they have trouble with n is and u is and b is and d is and they are reversing you know normal kids that goes away about age eight my kids they are still doing it you know they are still or they might make an eight from the bottom up instead of from the top down or a six from the bottom up i even had a kid once that made ones from the bottom up you could tell by watching them write that their brain did not work like yours did 

Recording: (6902/ 9621) 
i just like it because it is smaller 

Recording: (6903/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6904/ 9621) 
yeah yeah people say things like oh i wish i had a job where i got three months off every summer and i am just i hear people say stuff like that in the grocery store and i just want to walk up to the guy and grab him around the neck and say yeah and yesterday while you were watching the football game i was grading papers at the kitchen table you know and if i go out of town on the weekend i have to take my school bag and all my work with me it never ends you know i put in about 70 hours a week during the time of the year when i do teach and by the way it is not three months anymore you work for a week after the kids get out of school in june which usually puts you at about the 12th to the 15th of june school starts back the 23rd of august at least in worthington it did and you have to be back a week before that so they have shaved both ends of that off until it is like 10 days in june and maybe 15 days in august and all of july so and then you spend some of that time going to seminars and upgrading your certificate 

Recording: (6905/ 9621) 
i mean in some ways i think competition is a bad thing because in our society it is usually not fair someone always starts out ahead and is able to get ahead further but i mean i like the fact that we have got this super high tech tape recorder not a big reel to reel thing i like the fact that i could do a lot of my research for my thesis on a computer internet rather than going to the card catalog finding out that there are books that are not in our library and then where do i go from there i like being able to look oh library of congress has it i will just drive out to washington or have them send it here that i think is a major contribution of the past generation 

Recording: (6906/ 9621) 
which is nice we have got a lot of support from everybody it gets good kind of confusing on holidays 

Recording: (6907/ 9621) 
is not it unbelievable 

Recording: (6908/ 9621) 
oh yeah archie bunker meets fred flintstone there you go i can not really put him in the category of forrest gump because forrest gump was a great guy 

Recording: (6909/ 9621) 
yep i graduated from brookhaven 

Recording: (6910/ 9621) 
the only thing you can do is beat my rear end you know 

Recording: (6911/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6912/ 9621) 
yeah exactly 

Recording: (6913/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6914/ 9621) 
really classy 

Recording: (6915/ 9621) 
yeah i have lived with my mom since then 

Recording: (6916/ 9621) 
i was 

Recording: (6917/ 9621) 
yeah i could be in the something really like multimedia like that it is like uh how they designed it 

Recording: (6918/ 9621) 
makes it difficult it is an adjustment 

Recording: (6919/ 9621) 
yeah most of them do and then pretty much the rest of them just hang out go to school 

Recording: (6920/ 9621) 
see that is how my husband was he did not have a pet growing up 

Recording: (6921/ 9621) 
well i know with myself when we had pete always says that if it was not for me he would have gotten just too immersed in his job because he is really involved he likes what he is doing he has tremendous responsibility and but he loves it but the thing is when the kids were little too you know i was always having to pull him back and say do not forget you know they are going to grow up fast if you if you do not spend this time and now i mean like i said the youngest is 13 and so he is been at this for all these years and i do not have to do that anymore i mean someplace along the way about 10 years ago he got so involved in their lives but when they are little 

Recording: (6922/ 9621) 
let is see you usually go out to lunch at some fast food place and then we get together and cook dinner 

Recording: (6923/ 9621) 
so we lower the standards to meet that 

Recording: (6924/ 9621) 
the sheepherders and they were not very desirable specimens other than for herding sheep and we would come in dirty as an old sheepherder 

Recording: (6925/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6926/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (6927/ 9621) 
you know do i feel safe is this a place i can go is there somebody who always takes care of me and i think left to their own devices 

Recording: (6928/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6929/ 9621) 
mm hmm yeah because they think they are grown they think they are grown and they are like 12 and 13 and they have been having sex since they were 10 and it is just like and yeah and they are having babies earlier and earlier and it is just really scary 

Recording: (6930/ 9621) 
right i have a neighbor that is that way 

Recording: (6931/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (6932/ 9621) 
and 

Recording: (6933/ 9621) 
right well not just one my older brother would have been two and a half or three 

Recording: (6934/ 9621) 
no i just think that typically you see a lot of places that are under construction not very many people working there 

Recording: (6935/ 9621) 
coastside is going to be opening up on the 6th looking forward to doing that we had a season is pass to wyandotte lake spent a lot of time at the pools different swim centers hunter different rec centers the y programs are excellent even here at ohio state they have got the recreational sports on sunday afternoons where they can go we go to the zoo a lot libraries have story times reading hours those type of things just all kinds of community things easter egg hunts at the rec centers 

Recording: (6936/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (6937/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6938/ 9621) 
bye 

Recording: (6939/ 9621) 
i think so 

Recording: (6940/ 9621) 
disciplined i would be screamed at may get jumped on the floor to do pushups i mean it was it was just 

Recording: (6941/ 9621) 
do anything but touch the computer and sometimes it is like six and seven hours a day at the computer and i just do not want to do it 

Recording: (6942/ 9621) 
retire him 

Recording: (6943/ 9621) 
that was all on air 

Recording: (6944/ 9621) 
that is exactly how i am when you said what would i do i might do a house i might go to school some i used to own a gallery i might do something like that again there is just zillions of projects out there waiting to happen 

Recording: (6945/ 9621) 
it is just the spiritual aspect there is a realm even einstein the most brilliant man supposedly mathematically of our time even said that there will be people or should be people come along with better theories than he has yeah but nobody has taken the time or made the time to challenge his theory 

Recording: (6946/ 9621) 
that would probably affect my decision a little bit 

Recording: (6947/ 9621) 
yeah it is spring break a couple of teachers are taking a bunch of kids 

Recording: (6948/ 9621) 
what goes on nationally especially interested in this presidential election 

Recording: (6949/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (6950/ 9621) 
do not you think 

Recording: (6951/ 9621) 
but then they have one injury and then what are they going to do and they got to think of that they have a free education and they just do not think of it that way you know they think they can make enough money but you know 

Recording: (6952/ 9621) 
and also at the show of hands galleries 

Recording: (6953/ 9621) 
dude 

Recording: (6954/ 9621) 
you do not think it is growing too fast they should try to bring people back into the city more right i would say lack of notice in any other city in the united states why in the world do they have to work on all the roads all at the same time i do not understand they have to they are working on 315 270 70 71 670 all at the same time why why i do not planning going on there apparently not anyway okay our time is about up unless you have anything burning to say not really i think we covered most of the topics i usually cover and some that i only occasionally cover 

Recording: (6955/ 9621) 
mmhmm i was stationed permanent duty station was in north carolina 

Recording: (6956/ 9621) 
yeah they could afford to go there so they did 

Recording: (6957/ 9621) 
and there you go 

Recording: (6958/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6959/ 9621) 
ok yeah sure no it is ok 

Recording: (6960/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (6961/ 9621) 
i could fire them because they are gay i could care less 

Recording: (6962/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (6963/ 9621) 
so however this works out you know i do not know i am just like okay she just says i just want to get it over with and see now she you know 

Recording: (6964/ 9621) 
well her major is communications it did not start out that but my daughter wants to write books ok well 

Recording: (6965/ 9621) 
no i am living yeah that is my bro call 

Recording: (6966/ 9621) 
haha 

Recording: (6967/ 9621) 
her and her mother went and seen it and everything we were divorced at the time then i went and bought the movie 

Recording: (6968/ 9621) 
and then how satisfying is that to them when you have a chance to talk to them that is where we need to learn more from interview have more meaningful interviews with these people so that we can learn from them i put them on spotlight but we somehow we just do not wanna i guess flood them with the we do not wanna get the negative answer because oh it might hurt the image of the university oh gee no who is it katzenmoyer or something well hey we realize that the university only wants players who are to draw gate money that is all they want to do they are not here for academics they do not talk about academics when they are coming to ohio state 

Recording: (6969/ 9621) 
the teacher was there one day and she was pregnant with twins and the second day she was in the hospital those things happen 

Recording: (6970/ 9621) 
it was 

Recording: (6971/ 9621) 
stay off 

Recording: (6972/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6973/ 9621) 
a lot of people have switched from being like the really quiet more reserved people to the party animal 

Recording: (6974/ 9621) 
i would tend to say most people i know are at least fairly ethical i mean there is no more sinister group than the other that i know 

Recording: (6975/ 9621) 
eventually 

Recording: (6976/ 9621) 
he works 

Recording: (6977/ 9621) 
i think so i think partial birth is not such a big issue because i mean it hardly ever comes up but i with so many things it is like a it is a foot in the door if we can do that then we can say well you know maybe not in the third trimester and then we can say well not in the second trimester 

Recording: (6978/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (6979/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6980/ 9621) 
i have almost been hit i do not know how many times people talking on telephones i see people turning with no turn signals 

Recording: (6981/ 9621) 
there is a web access to some of our systems but not all of them we are putting more uniform on it for everything and i do not it may be osu has its own system but they can also connect to our system for things they do not have in their system and it is so i am not sure what system you are talking about 

Recording: (6982/ 9621) 
i am gonna cry 

Recording: (6983/ 9621) 
mhm 

Recording: (6984/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6985/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (6986/ 9621) 
yeah yeah yeah you can not ignore it because you know because that is something else when i was in high school i do not think i knew the word but now everybody knows anybody who is a little bit different is likely to be called a faggot and so it is better if you can diffuse that but i boy i would not know how to approach it i mean i think it should be approached but ooh i would not have a clue 

Recording: (6987/ 9621) 
like yeah like 500 people in a lecture hall yeah 

Recording: (6988/ 9621) 
yeah i am 235 

Recording: (6989/ 9621) 
ha ha ha 

Recording: (6990/ 9621) 
the united states knows about it they can sit there and they will pay the welfare they will not do nothing to him 

Recording: (6991/ 9621) 
real war 

Recording: (6992/ 9621) 
right and it is all the bucks because people i work with you know there are some people i work with that have house payments one guy he has the biggest $2200 a month and a lot of them have like $1500 and up and you know i bought my house years and years ago and it is like $485 and i would not dare tell him that but it is like you know because they are always you know there are people there that make a lot more money than i do and they are always like broke but yet you know like when they go do something they have got to have the best of everything the best of it is like you know you know to me you just have to kind of think about things a little bit and it is like you know do i do i really need to go to what would i say tgi fridays for lunch and spend $12 or can i go to taco bell and spend like three and use the other part for maybe like a book for my kid or you know they have like my daughters in swimming i need the money for a swimsuit well why do not i use it for that you know so it is 

Recording: (6993/ 9621) 
because it is more open and you couch it in terms of civil rights my boyfriend thinks it is wrong morally but does not think we ought to be discriminating against he thinks it is a sin therefore he thinks they should repent and the way to do that is through talking to them religionwise i do not think it is a sin i think that your sexuality is geneticbased and that you can no more change your sexual orientation than you can the color of your eyes or your hair you may put a dye on it or you may put a different whatever those eye pieces are contacts i do not wear glasses so i can never remember those terms but that is just cosmetic and anyone who tries to change their sexual orientation that is cosmetic too and again my belief is whatever happens between consenting adults is their business not mine so i do not know that anyone could change it what was your question again 

Recording: (6994/ 9621) 
wander around look at things 

Recording: (6995/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6996/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6997/ 9621) 
well it is gotta come from the top i just found there was just a total lack of interest in the student from every direction so i would say you know it is an organizational problem and no you know no motivation you know to do their job you know properly now i live down the street from what they call cause it is columbus alternative high school and you get there through a lottery system and they have the best reputation of all the columbus schools and those kids leave there getting full scholarships my son went there one year it was a disaster for him 

Recording: (6998/ 9621) 
yeah they are prostrike we are getting money on buck ids but you know 

Recording: (6999/ 9621) 
a bad one or a good one 

Recording: (7000/ 9621) 
so there is been a lot of pressure there 

Recording: (7001/ 9621) 
and a disease that affected her mind and of course you know back then i did not really know that but there was a lot of conflict 

Recording: (7002/ 9621) 
yeah it was interesting 

Recording: (7003/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7004/ 9621) 
that flipped me out 

Recording: (7005/ 9621) 
how can you do that 

Recording: (7006/ 9621) 
i mean i did not have the greatest childhood i do not think any of us ever really had the best you know but but i would not talk to my kid the way some of these people talk to them but one today you know she got on the bus and a little girl one set over here she is probably about eight maybe six or something like that and she wanted to set here mommy so she made her set with her which is cool and mommy just goes to sleep and the little kid is trying to study her homework you know for i do not know was you up all night partying or was you up all night working you know or what the hell is your problem 

Recording: (7007/ 9621) 
i do not really see anybody i was totally ready to vote for elizabeth dole and then she opened her mouth and things came out she had the best chance out of any woman that is ever run for president and she was in a major party which has not happened before and it would have been really funny to see what happened to bob dole over it you know be the first man after having run for the office 

Recording: (7008/ 9621) 
but then in the very next breath they said well in two weeks we are going to california to visit paul now anyhow i was telling each of my children because i was upset and i was telling them this and they are all going oh mom my older girls are going oh you know and my daughter who is 13 is fabulous she is so blunt she is just so out there and so different from so many other children and she said well do you actually care if he comes here you do not care do you and i said well i do not care but it makes me feel bad it hurts my feelings 

Recording: (7009/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7010/ 9621) 
my personal belief is that they should be allowed to because i believe they should have the male gender as well as the female gender for a proper bringing of them 

Recording: (7011/ 9621) 
you know i think a lot of it depends on i do not know if it is different parts of the country but cultures and everything because you know it just seems in some parts of the midwest but maybe kentucky and west virginia it seems girls down there a lot of them get married so young that is just what they want to do but they are not thinking of any future or wanting to go to college or anything like that i have to cough is it okay i am sorry i did not want to be like

Recording: (7017/ 9621)

Recording: (7018/ 9621) 
first grade the first grade teacher was aware of what he needed but the principal would not let her give it to him he had to do what everybody else in the class was doing he was even tutoring some of the kids in first grade and at the last grading period every day she would give him a math paper to work on he said i showed you how to do this i am not doing it 

Recording: (7019/ 9621)

Recording: (7026/ 9621) 
to marry him and she moved over and 

Recording: (7027/ 9621) 
i mean as old as i am i still got that against him and that is what i want my son to keep i want him to know his father and be around him even though he is not the best of person 

Recording: (7028/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (7029/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7030/ 9621) 
we see that is not proved out by the the approval ratings he still has higher approval rating than reagan had in his last 18 months so you know people still like what he what he is done i think that that that you know people do not like all the crap that went with him is the pundits on tv you know they say that and they are they are still trying to get him i mean before he was even elected they were trying to get him which is what they would have done to elizabeth dole they would not have been able to attack on the issue so they would find other things to get iran so they started bringing out all these women and all that stuff on and most people did not care about it they did not care about it before the election they did not care about it during his campaign they did not care about it during his presidency it was some republican rightwing i do not know what who were just trying to make an issue out of nothing it was not watergate he may have been a cad but she was 21 it is not like it was someone who could not make up her own mind what she wanted to do and he may have been stupid and a cad but i did not want to know about it on day one when it hit the news i did not want to know about it and on the end when he was you know not impeached i did not want to know about it and in between i did not want to know about it and they just kept angering me because there were other things i wanted the government to do and this congress is the worst i have ever seen in not getting anything done and not really being able to be on the pulse of where america is on such issues as gun control and women is rights and things that are important to people you know they have tried to make pseudo issues out of clinton and then they try to make a pseudo issue out of you know giving a tax cut people do not want a tax cut when it is going to affect their social security or affect you know the deficit 

Recording: (7031/ 9621) 
i talked about this with my husband like i said i do not have any kids yet and he keeps saying you do not want to just be worried that i roll over on the or the people roll over on their babies i do not see how you could roll over on anything that size and not know it unless you were on drugs or drunk or whatever you know what i mean 

Recording: (7032/ 9621) 
i would like to teach the field is particularly saturated right now so i am not holding out hopes for a teaching job i mean i would like to think that i could distinguish myself within the field and get a job but i mean right now those jobs simply are not available so i am approaching things like whatever happens happens i am gonna pursue my my interests and then go on from there rather than necessarily thinking about career plans after i finish my schooling 

Recording: (7033/ 9621) 
that is awfully young but again he is got this baby yet they did not talk about how this baby how you make a baby or everything associated and i do not know if they should be talking about that yet but here he is with this baby and it is just like okay 

Recording: (7034/ 9621) 
they are there 

Recording: (7035/ 9621) 
definitely i definitely the way i feel the death penalty is wrong but uh i do not know people are always like oh you know if your mother if your mother was killed god forbid but like you would want the death money but honestly i do not think i would i really like i would feel anger towards that person but killing them it does not help me with my maybe the family say it helps with closure and everything but i that me is it is displacing my anger in a way that actually i do not think my victim that was so close to me would want me to do you know so 

Recording: (7036/ 9621) 
and then while she was out there she met a cowboy who was also from ohio and they were married while they were out there i guess but she was as my son used to say she was a piece of work she had definite ideas about it putting her everything 

Recording: (7037/ 9621) 
oh why and here i come from this is a gentleman that is dark skinned i do not know if he is black or colored i am still confused as to what the difference between black and colored is but he says my brothers probably came to these islands to the continental they come down here and they are getting all they are swaying themselves they are acting cocky to me and so forth i say we do not do that here and i said well i know this you know there is a lot of black population here creole mix and that type of thing which i would consider colored not black to me black black is black if you have anything mixed in it it is colored but he said we do not do that he said the problem in the states guys you guys daddy wants kid wants a car get him a car down here john when he comes from school i gave him a dinner by asking him to sleep off the front porch now i will still give him his dinner but i ask him please did you do your sleep off the front porch may not sound much but at least i am trying to teach him something and you saw a lot of that down there in the people where we were down in frederikberg but it is just those things you learn and then there is other times i was down in jamaica and you went back into the back country and you saw very impoverished areas 

Recording: (7038/ 9621) 
secretarial administrative assistant type work 

Recording: (7039/ 9621) 
it is 

Recording: (7040/ 9621) 
yeah you know i have just come to i always prefer for my children and myself i mean if there is anything disney i usually go and watch it you know at the movie theater and after a while it is like i think beauty and the beast is where it really came through to me it is like that is a wonderful story but do they have to have all that killing and so on in the middle right in the middle of it 

Recording: (7041/ 9621) 
yeah that was it that is hard to believe when you hear all that and see all that again you are just like wow wait what were those people thinking 

Recording: (7042/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7043/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7044/ 9621) 
there has been some serious consideration but no there was some a lot someone took up a petition and was urging him to do it but he is decided he did not want to oprah is one of them and all those other people it is just like her and of course they get into the smut and everything else and what they have done and all that malarkey and i think he decided he had to do the same thing on his program or for him to keep his ratings up so and see that is what you mean by getting into what this person does over here and that is another thing we need to teach our kids because john doe jane doe is doing it does have farmers we have politicians what else we got in there we have professors 

Recording: (7045/ 9621) 
i think he is 

Recording: (7046/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7047/ 9621) 
it is much fun as it was the first time i just not 

Recording: (7048/ 9621) 
it is crazy because everybody wants to buy us everything and i have got oh my gosh they are like just give me a list and somebody is like i want to get this and i want to get that so it is just been something else which is good though because our families are pretty similar and they are all 

Recording: (7049/ 9621) 
mhm 

Recording: (7050/ 9621) 
civil rights only went so far they have not corrected the wrongs in the past they have not created a sense in our society that anyone can achieve like the american dream in my opinion is an absolute lie 

Recording: (7051/ 9621) 
and they were just wild you know i just ran every minute and i took it as a substitute and did not know from day to day you know whether it is going to keep it i finally had to say i can not do this twentyseven kindergartens i am sorry i can not do this by myself 

Recording: (7052/ 9621) 
really so is it is that so like the economy is pretty good right now well right now it is shaky okay not too many dot coms apparently over there 

Recording: (7053/ 9621) 
well i am gonna speak from my relationship my dad was out of town quite a bit when we were growing up so from a maternal aspect you know mom was there all the time and a lot of times she filled both the male and the female the mother and the father role you know as far as punishment and everything like that but it just would depend depend i know in my respect it would have been a lot better i think for myself and everything you know i mean for you know we would have been able to had joint custody with her and everything you know when she was growing up because from or by her being out there i mean you know you can just imagine she is and being a girl not saying anything bad about girls but being my daughter you know worried about things in school and weekends and stuff like that so or if i was closer to her i would not worry so much about it 

Recording: (7054/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7055/ 9621) 
and it got broken into and you know he is paying rent on this apartment and he is back home because the police said that this apartment has been hit many times so it is just a big mess right now you know he had a nice you know his better clothes stolen his jewelry a few other minor things but he did not want his tv and vcr and those kind of things to get stolen so he moved them back home and then he started worrying about something else and that moves back then he is worried about his car because somebody down the street got their car stolen so it is just going to be a matter of rearranging he is applying for another scholarship he gets some already so if he would get this other scholarship i think it would help him be able to move into the fraternity i think he can get out of the apartment by subleasing it but he has to get the $75 to give to the landlord they charge $75 to do that to advertise and screen 

Recording: (7056/ 9621) 
i mean obviously everyone has their dark side but i would say in general people are pretty good people 

Recording: (7057/ 9621) 
아 

Recording: (7058/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (7059/ 9621) 
i moved into the dorms late september last fall 

Recording: (7060/ 9621)

Recording: (7062/ 9621) 
hmm 

Recording: (7063/ 9621) 
well the wolf family and the mcconnells have been around forever you know worthington industries and the wolf family as close as dispatch then you got i think it is rizzuti who is like a what is it construction guy so they have been around forever and everything and they can get their ways through political arenas and everything but i think most of the money was was private money but they were given like tax incentives and things of that nature 

Recording: (7064/ 9621) 
it is pretty much a ritzy place 

Recording: (7065/ 9621) 
and yeah i would never want to go back to the old way never 

Recording: (7066/ 9621) 
and field artillery is really interesting i found it really interesting because when you get into figuring firing data 

Recording: (7067/ 9621) 
i am not 

Recording: (7068/ 9621) 
i said that and he is like 

Recording: (7069/ 9621) 
what it is is most people do not want kids to live in reality 

Recording: (7070/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7071/ 9621) 
and no legal sanctions are going to make any particular difference to the attitude you have going into it 

Recording: (7072/ 9621) 
that is a roundabout way of getting there 

Recording: (7073/ 9621) 
i would not doubt it i hope they vote against it but i do not think they will 

Recording: (7074/ 9621) 
it is kind of hard when you have got your limited choices here some of the issues i thought were kind of important but when you are looking at the mayoral candidates did you watch that debate 

Recording: (7075/ 9621) 
because it stops your heart right away 

Recording: (7076/ 9621) 
no i do not think so 

Recording: (7077/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7078/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7079/ 9621) 
and 

Recording: (7080/ 9621) 
but there is things that are difficult like there is that where we go we we have a temple too and they can not go in the temple well they can but they have to fit certain criteria they have to be baptized and not and follow all these health codes and all the different codes and but that is not what they are interested in doing so and that is hard i think and going on a mission they did not understand that my dad was like do they know how small you are they are sending you to siberia 

Recording: (7081/ 9621) 
well when you think about the different generations and things we certainly did not have the things to worry about that people do now when i was in elementary and junior high we would have never dreamed of anybody having a good gun or even let alone a knife i mean that is violence and that goes back to kids and how much time and effort you put into them kids are ignored and pushed aside and they are in the way and there is so many people that do not even want them and then they get into school and they get violent and they take it out and everybody is surprised i am not because i know there is a lot of anger and a lot of hate for these little kids and going to school is going to be so dangerous i think because you have so many of them in one little room and they are coming from so many different backgrounds and if you take each one of their situations i can bet the statistics as time goes on that they are not going to have one caring parent you know maybe not even one of the parents you know they might have a foster family or you know somebody that wants to pretend like they care there is a lot of people that are foster families that only want the money and there is all that so it is really scary and i think that something has to be done real fast i do not know what i think it starts from what we teach them and as adults what we allow to be out there the computers i mean oh my gosh i did not even get a computer because i was so afraid of what they could be able to access there was nothing barred at all when they first came out yeah and you know where are all those software people they are not responsible for y2k they are not responsible for all this internet access to all this stuff so it is really hard 

Recording: (7082/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7083/ 9621) 
i swear it is possessed if i could figure out how to work fdisk and format in dos i might be able to figure out what my problem is because i started running windows 2000 about three months ago that was a dumb mistake one of the guys in my house is a software pirate and he got me a copy of 2000 he was like dude your computer will run 2000 let is put it on your computer 

Recording: (7084/ 9621) 
older kids

hahahahaha 

Recording: (7091/ 9621)

Recording: (7092/ 9621) 
yeah it is mainly what happens is you get all the out of town bad stuff i mean it just kind of absorbs like a sponge 

Recording: (7093/ 9621) 
well i believe it is quality not quantity ideally one parent would be there be it male or female you know man or wife man or lady but you know your quality time is more important you know if you come home and all you want to do is sit down and start watching tv or drinking beer or whatever you know not spending any time with your child it does not matter whether you are there all day or whether you are there for two hours 

Recording: (7094/ 9621) 
it is just bazooka 

Recording: (7095/ 9621)

Recording: (7099/ 9621) 
go go go so it is tough 

Recording: (7100/ 9621) 
well it is not how it is put into effect the law it is how it is enforced you do not just say well little johnny stuck his finger in a pie and you can not do that anymore the more security you are going to have over that pie the more he is going to want it and going into the gun thing it is pretty much nobody is winning game i mean you make stricter laws you are gonna get you know even more and more people you know struggling to get a gun and shoot somebody is head off so the school thing pretty much says itself metal detectors and police at the schools it is come down to that nowadays any gun you get from criminals should i mean they already melt them at buckeye steel but there is a little bit more you can do with those than burn them you know you could set them up in some kind of top secret lab you know out in dc somewhere the pentagon just have rooms and rooms stacked full of guns and i mean hell in case we have to do have to go to war you know just keep that little reserve 

Recording: (7101/ 9621) 
damn it 

Recording: (7102/ 9621) 
uh huh 

Recording: (7103/ 9621) 
yeah it is difficult 

Recording: (7104/ 9621) 
and 

Recording: (7105/ 9621) 
not really i mean yeah there is some little flaws but 

Recording: (7106/ 9621) 
just like premarital sex i mean there was no way i would ever discuss anything like that ever with her i mean that was just something that you did not 

Recording: (7107/ 9621) 
we do not know who is in the airplane but there are seaplanes that do come in and out of there 

Recording: (7108/ 9621)

Recording: (7114/ 9621) 
absolutely 

Recording: (7115/ 9621) 
and i would been there three four days and finally at breakfast one morning henry said well you have not talked about clinton and the impeachment yet and i said henry because he is the republican i said i do not even want to go there i said i do not even think we want to get involved in that conversation he said well i can understand you saying that but i want to tell you where i am he said when this whole thing started i sat down and wrote every one of my new jersey representatives all of my senators and all of the congress people new jersey and told them that i will never ever in my life vote republican again because of the way this has played out i mean this was a republican a lifelong republican he says i will always now vote democrat because this was just so stupid and such a waste of my time the country is time the country is money when there are better things to be dealing with and a lot of republicans felt that way you have got to be really extreme right wing to feel other than that except here in central ohio 

Recording: (7116/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7117/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7118/ 9621)

Recording: (7119/ 9621) 
originally northside 

Recording: (7120/ 9621) 
people that just really want to teach as opposed to like i do not know why other people want to like even went into teaching at all you know but i think that would help just making it more like not so impersonal not so this is you know you do this to get this certain grade it is like you do this to learn this because it is interesting as opposed to like and i do not know i think it is like there is a lot of things that it is more compulsory education is weird like being forced to take this class like i think that if i i mean it is good to being forced to take abroad like a liberal arts thing because like you do not know what you want to do so it is like if like you hate math and you do not take it at all but then you decide you want to do something in math and you are like screwed like can not go back and 

Recording: (7121/ 9621) 
i do not know that much detail but most times it comes down to a lack of knowing your children how they are going to react to certain things i do not know the details of the thing other than the fact that there seems like a lot of envy going on with them i think that is part of the problem we have in our life it would be very difficult i think in traveling if you say you say okay i am going to give up this life here and go to the third world and live or let us do let us reverse busing hey okay upper arlington you live on the northwest side why do not you go down and live on the east side 

Recording: (7122/ 9621)

you know 

Recording: (7126/ 9621) 
hehe oh yeah 

Recording: (7127/ 9621) 
you could argue both of those too but i mean personally i would say that is just teaching them more than what they need to know i think that is a little bit too much 

Recording: (7128/ 9621) 
wow it is not every sunday anymore but it was for a long time it was for a long time 

Recording: (7129/ 9621)

Recording: (7141/ 9621)

Recording: (7165/ 9621) 
i would like to see that implemented something like that in the united states that would be a neat thing you know because like i know like iron foundry is and some like like the lower paying jobs like they hire people that are illiterate and things like that and they can not like give paychecks out on thursdays because everyone will call off on fridays because they all go out and get drunk or i do not know what they do with their paychecks i know that is a big big problem 

Recording: (7166/ 9621) 
you know when i hear about kids 12 13 luckily i was not that early but i think once they start you know like sixth grade they really should relate to them 

Recording: (7167/ 9621) 
uh huh 

Recording: (7168/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7169/ 9621) 
and it is kind of weird because when i went from middle school to high school it was like a big growing up period and i see them like what are you doing that for 

Recording: (7170/ 9621) 
right tuesday wednesday and thursday every night 

Recording: (7171/ 9621) 
now they are well my mom feeds them very well she probably thinks oh they are like her green kids 

Recording: (7172/ 9621) 
yeah that is one of the drawbacks 

Recording: (7173/ 9621) 
no i knew i would not change my mind on that either i am pretty strongwilled about things 

Recording: (7174/ 9621) 
but everybody in my family is mechanically inclined 

Recording: (7175/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (7176/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7177/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7178/ 9621) 
i would get more people asking me for that and i mean it turns out pretty nice i am making about 10 or 11 bucks an hour 

Recording: (7179/ 9621) 
yeah i do not think i could vote for a violent president i could vote for a president that made some mistakes with their personal life 

Recording: (7180/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (7181/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7182/ 9621) 
well i thought it went the way it was supposed to go 

Recording: (7183/ 9621) 
i hope your father does not drink 

Recording: (7184/ 9621) 
and he could see assume he is educated and not stupid otherwise he would not be a magistrate could see that that person did that 

Recording: (7185/ 9621) 
um about six yeah did we get her we have had her for two years yeah we did about six months we went to hawaii and got his brother married and then we came back we knew that would be the last long trip and we were going to wait until the spring but we could not so we went to a rescue service and got her yeah 

Recording: (7186/ 9621) 
i mean most men are dogs yeah 

Recording: (7187/ 9621) 
but that is kind of you know it kind of came through where they were like when i was growing up we had the you know you had your jocks and everything of course and you had your we were called duds you know and i was kind of like in the middle you know i played a little bit of sport you know but i also associated with them and they were basically potheads you know everything so so i could say i you know i was kind of associated with both of them but then the football players you know some of them were pretty pretty much asses you know no other way to put especially if they were got scholarships and stuff you know they were and they could be real nasty but i just can not sign a knife thank me i look at it back it is like oh i have got into arguments with a few of them and seen him later on you know and it is like a man you know i buy a beer you know whatever you know sorry about what happened we were five years ago you know i did not buy you a beer or whatever sorry about what happened it should have happened five years ago i try to forget things my mind is got enough to absorb without worrying about which i do worry quite a bit about things but stupid stuff like that somebody gets mad at you because you are you are not a jock or you know you are you are you are you are this or you are that you know everybody trying to label people and stuff 

Recording: (7188/ 9621) 
i think 

Recording: (7189/ 9621) 
they think everything they say is hilarious oh it is just middle school i think it is transitioning from childhood to adulthood is a tough time and when you have all the other things going on like you can not read and you can not write and you can not spell then it is just even worse it is exacerbated even more so i get the ones that everybody else throws out of their class 

Recording: (7190/ 9621) 
i think outside of the honors program a lot of it is but within the honors program i think there is some really really exceptional things going on 

Recording: (7191/ 9621) 
oh yeah yep 

Recording: (7192/ 9621) 
and it is very hard on my wife i do not know but we will get through it 

Recording: (7193/ 9621) 
yeah imagine you learned it in a hurry 

Recording: (7194/ 9621) 
yeah and they are all so different but he deals real well with people so he is really and he is even thinking of going into business for himself yeah he almost did that this year and then he thought no i do not want all the headaches so he is like the top guy of the people that he works for 

Recording: (7195/ 9621) 
i am not 

Recording: (7196/ 9621) 
so i do hope that she does she is a good writer i do hope that someday she can be able to do that 

Recording: (7197/ 9621) 
hmm 

Recording: (7198/ 9621) 
and people do not 

Recording: (7199/ 9621) 
yeah and i was really young when i met my husband i was 14 in high school so we kind of grew up together i did not know anything else and just two complete different people you know different needs and everything else so 

Recording: (7200/ 9621) 
are you dead 

Recording: (7201/ 9621) 
god do what 

Recording: (7202/ 9621) 
and he is very opinionated and it is interesting when he talks about anything he loves to talk about politics and social issues and that sort of thing you can tell that he is thought about it and has clearly formulated what his stance is on it and he is very articulate about it sometimes his responses are immature but he is 19 

Recording: (7203/ 9621) 
selling time for money yes 

Recording: (7204/ 9621) 
well obviously i sort of surmounted that because i have been you know i have spent a lot of time there since then i think had i only studied there for a semester or a quarter i would have come back with a completely different attitude but i was there for a whole year so the first few months were a little bit difficult but then you know after that you know you just sort of you know get to the point where you just kind of you know laugh it off and just think oh here we go again 

Recording: (7205/ 9621) 
some ideas about it i figured it is something i should know about 

Recording: (7206/ 9621) 
it is not necessarily because of necessity more often than not maybe even today it is less than that it does not depend because of a loss of a parent or inability of a parent or parents being able to handle those children so yes those things do exist and they will always have some but that is a very him go down the drain and i think that that is what adoption is and you are really accepting this responsibility and that is love and when you are trying and willing to have well some people probably argue about this but i am sorry if god did not mean that i can conceive and have my own child why should i try to implant somebody else is inside of me and produce it i mean i would rather go out and see this other child that really needs help and adopt that baby because you can see them and you can help them and you are already aware to a certain extent of what genes they might have inherited and what problems you might be getting sometimes you do not later on you will find out but still you can go back and you can find the parent and i do not know whether they are going to be able to trace these genes back and say you know later on if something happens to this child you are having and find out well what did they inherit over here but if you have adopted a child you can go back and you can find it out and help the child better 

Recording: (7207/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7208/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7209/ 9621) 
he knows they show a picture oh that is who man chewers 

Recording: (7210/ 9621) 
well we do not want to know she is the only one that wants to know her boyfriend he does not want to know either so sarah decided that she could not go and find out the sex of it because she could not keep a secret so anyhow we just do not know 

Recording: (7211/ 9621) 
wow i do not know if there could be there are certain programs different communitybased programs getting but again those are my values as i say steering the kids into a churchbased program if they can not be there putting them with families and friends that you know and trust to look after them giving them the guidance that they need the ymca programs are wonderful they give them a structured activity to do where they are supervised but again those programs a lot of times cost money that the families do not have and it may not be their values to put them in those type of programs 

Recording: (7212/ 9621) 
german 

Recording: (7213/ 9621) 
i do not think we need eight months and we need to start the campaign even a year before the primaries it is just too long people start tuning out and there is only so much you can say and it is like the candidates 

Recording: (7214/ 9621) 
and i do not agree with that either 

Recording: (7215/ 9621) 
i thought i would expect that from dogs i mean yeah a dog can probably get away with that kind of stuff but in broad daylight 

Recording: (7216/ 9621) 
i know i know i know i mean i started 

Recording: (7217/ 9621) 
well i had a driver down here last time so i am going to bring her back if she does not come back i might as well come with her i am just kidding we went to get something to eat and i dropped her off and she took the bus home 

Recording: (7218/ 9621) 
my dad like 

Recording: (7219/ 9621) 
when in the 50s and 60s you very seldom saw black people on tv and then you start seeing a couple of black people on tv and then there was the jeffersons and although i found the jeffersons offensive in many ways because it was stereotypical and made fun of black people in many ways in retrospect it was trend setting and what it did and even in putting blacks in advertisements on tv young kids saw them and saw those ads and saw those tv programs and so it became a part of everyday life and the more you see something the more it becomes more acceptable so maybe that is having an effect maybe 50 years from now we will look back on those tv programs and think they were trendsetting instead of stereotypical but i am sure it does have some influence because i think it did it was not the only thing that had an influence but it was one of the little pieces of the puzzle that helps i think matthew shepard helped also 

Recording: (7220/ 9621) 
right i think teaching band might be fun because i think you only ever got a satisfactory or unsatisfactory in band and it had mostly to do with whether you were there whether you were well behaved yeah and whether you are trying to play your instrument i do not think we ever got a is b is and c is yeah 

Recording: (7221/ 9621) 
i have not been anywhere except for canada and niagara falls i was about three years old that is when my dad died while we was up there no less 

Recording: (7222/ 9621) 
hehe 

Recording: (7223/ 9621) 
and 

Recording: (7224/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7225/ 9621) 
you know somebody lied to you buddy he said they were just looking at him like you know no way they were like nah 

Recording: (7226/ 9621) 
right right 

Recording: (7227/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7228/ 9621) 
violence 

Recording: (7229/ 9621) 
i do not think it is necessarily that i think it comes back to the lack of selfdiscipline 

Recording: (7230/ 9621) 
at cosi 

Recording: (7231/ 9621) 
the reason that it was one of the best years of my life is it is an incredibly beautiful setting and the people that came to participate in that were very very high people and it was mostly of course young people but they were incredibly idealistic and incredibly searching for answers in i mean their questions and their conversations talk about opinions as a matter of fact that is the only thing i felt difficult about living there was they would be asking all these incredible questions and i would be trying to do the dishes or something mundane like that it is like i do not want to do the dishes i just want to answer the questions 

Recording: (7232/ 9621) 
they are supposed to be not physically possible it goes against the first law of physics but i saw it happen 

Recording: (7233/ 9621) 
so that works out pretty well 

Recording: (7234/ 9621) 
mhm 

Recording: (7235/ 9621) 
the beginning of the end yep i grew up in upper arlington yeah really those five miles make such a difference though yeah because i live on campus 

Recording: (7236/ 9621) 
those things are hard as hell to scratch 

Recording: (7237/ 9621) 
you know so unfortunately you know and i guess i never thought of it a lot more pressure is put on schools and education now 

Recording: (7238/ 9621) 
where they can go every day the way i look at it also too when i was a kid like i said i started working two jobs when i was 14 you can not even find a job unless you are 16 nowadays 

Recording: (7239/ 9621) 
it is considered urban but because it is north of akron we play like a lot of like the inner city like in akron schools but in my opinion it is suburbia like but we have the we have the big city problems like there is a lot of drugs and i think that is just because the building is old so no one really takes pride in it and then it is 2000 people 

Recording: (7240/ 9621) 
well when he first started out 

Recording: (7241/ 9621) 
right right 

Recording: (7242/ 9621) 
graphic design in particular after i quit wrestling i got really into computers so i pretty much live on my computer now 

Recording: (7243/ 9621) 
and my sister was here like i said and then moved out just came back a couple months ago my grandfather just passed away but he was here in a nursing home for about a year 

Recording: (7244/ 9621) 
do you think that is because students are really sort of the dorms too and i really i really did not like that like it was like i do not know it is like living in a hotel or something it was really weird and like 

Recording: (7245/ 9621) 
i have sex 

Recording: (7246/ 9621) 
because there is some people that actually can not work 

Recording: (7247/ 9621) 
right yep but $50 a week 

Recording: (7248/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7249/ 9621) 
mhm 

Recording: (7250/ 9621) 
i do not know i had not thought about that no i do not get the impression that value says anything to do with what they are doing in this school 

Recording: (7251/ 9621) 
but 

Recording: (7252/ 9621) 
they will also let them work 75 if they are sick i had a heart attack had to come back to work early because i was out of sick leave and like i said i have been here 25 years and they would not even put me on first shift because they said it was not a good enough reason 

Recording: (7253/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (7254/ 9621) 
they always find some silly way to slain his words and make him look bad and it is really disgusting 

Recording: (7255/ 9621) 
i know that is a lot easier said than done because you fall in love every other week sometimes when you are young but i do not think it encourages it i just think you know they show so much on tv it is all you know people are nude at 10 oclock at night on these shows and these girls are watching it i mean granted most of them are adults but on the soap operas and stuff it is a different story so they are seeing it anyways you just i think if you are open enough with your children these parents and say we want to give you this option we prefer you do not do this but if you decide to do it we want you to be protected 

Recording: (7256/ 9621) 
okay i better go 

Recording: (7257/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (7258/ 9621) 
mhm 

Recording: (7259/ 9621)

Recording: (7263/ 9621) 
well there was a house i did not want it so that was easy 

Recording: (7264/ 9621) 
oh no 

Recording: (7265/ 9621) 
bye 

Recording: (7266/ 9621) 
yeah they are russian orthodox same basically the same thing 

Recording: (7267/ 9621) 
so we are talking an extraordinarily low level understanding of what computers are how they work so class one was demystifying the computer we took it apart we labeled everything inside i gave them all a piece i said put it back together we turned it on we saw if it worked we went back in figured out why it did not work took it apart again this was not so that they can do hardware because hardware has no money in it but it was so that they are not scared of the magic box 

Recording: (7268/ 9621) 
okay no i have not been following it really 

Recording: (7269/ 9621) 
that is what traveling does it makes you appreciate what you got makes you realize all the things you do have and makes you feel like wow actually pretty much nowhere that is why i want a book exactly not too much not just studying like you realize teaching and studying takes up a lot of time 

Recording: (7270/ 9621) 
hahaha 

Recording: (7271/ 9621) 
and a damn thing they are scared of when i we were kids we used to make zip guns we take an ink pen take the pen piece out put a firecracker in 

Recording: (7272/ 9621) 
that would be the closest mall to me is northland it is convenient for me 

Recording: (7273/ 9621) 
yeah i just wear my glasses for more for you know reading i can see far away 

Recording: (7274/ 9621) 
you know when he can wrestle with them and all that right now he is just he sits there and when he cries he goes what does he want like i know go down the list hun change his diaper if he it is been three hours since he is had a bottle give him a bottle you know 

Recording: (7275/ 9621) 
no mom we do not want to do that because they do not want to have to be responsible for them at school and wherever 

Recording: (7276/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7277/ 9621) 
here 

Recording: (7278/ 9621) 
i lived i actually went there for interior design i lived right off the street 

Recording: (7279/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (7280/ 9621) 
the more laid back 

Recording: (7281/ 9621) 
you are going to cross the street you know fourlane highway and you are sitting there going 

Recording: (7282/ 9621) 
i really do not think we are incredibly racist 

Recording: (7283/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7284/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (7285/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7286/ 9621) 
i can not wait till mine is crawling and or walking and all that and he can take you to places and you have to carry him you can hold his hand 

Recording: (7287/ 9621) 
bring what is in your heart out and sometimes you will say stuff that does not even make sense but you say it and it brings it out and that is what it is for so i mean it is a struggle understanding that and i made it through all four rounds this time and i even sat up which was the first time it is a struggle but it is uh it is necessary for the way i follow if it did not especially for men women have a purification every month 

Recording: (7288/ 9621) 
at this point i stopped for a moment and i am just like so nobody can think their divorce was so important that i need to sit down to deal with it because i obviously i have a curiosity that something whack is afoot and so i am like okay i sit down your father killed himself this morning and i said oh and then there is like a sort of a white out period there so you do not get like decent details on what occurred i do not actually think anything exciting occurred i think mostly it was me and my sister on my lap and me smelling my sister is wet stinky hair because it smelled of cigarette smoke for some reason so wet stinky hair wet because i was crying into it and then more time passes so some indeterminate length of time later i look over at the police officer who is standing on one side and the cops are there basically to make sure i do not freak out and that is finally sunk in i was like the cops are here so you do not freak i am like well i am not really in any danger of freaking out am i and then you look at the first officer and you are like oh what would freaking out look like you would never know that is why the cops are here oh okay well that makes more sense i was like ok so i looked over at the car i said i have a friend upstairs and i was not able to put on anything more than that and he did not come out anywhere near that well 

Recording: (7289/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7290/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (7291/ 9621) 
um just get away from my parents for a while you know it is kind of good for me just to be away it is part of the experience like learning to do my own laundry and stuff i used to be so bad about it and now all of a sudden i do not care really 

Recording: (7292/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7293/ 9621) 
all this other stuff 

Recording: (7294/ 9621) 
i know well you get to take advantage of it for layovers and stuff 

Recording: (7295/ 9621) 
their daycare i do not know it is tough i think really i believe more in that large corporations need to have some kind of daycare offered it is just there is not that many people anymore that can afford to have a oneincome family i mean you know we could do it you know but you know we would not live as nice as we do we would not have as nice of cars as we do you know we would struggle a little more so so it is a tossup it is a real 

Recording: (7296/ 9621) 
well yeah he taught math but they had a general curriculum it was just like he taught seventh grade they gave him math science supposedly social studies all the stuff that i mean it was very poorly run to begin with so we would go out and try and find books for the kids and you heard that he had not bought them books so we had to buy them i mean they got reimbursed but it was just ridiculous so they were trying to do anything they could just to keep their jobs and keep the school 

Recording: (7297/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7298/ 9621) 
harry yeah i am like oh my god what did we do like my grandmother is name was olive when i was born my dad said why she looks just like your mother to my mom and i have turned out to do everything that she did i have turned out to teach she was a teacher i have turned out to be you know real good in the kitchen and baking and i do like crafts like she did knitting and crocheting and i do that but i am sure glad they did not name me olive 

Recording: (7299/ 9621) 
nah we are just both having to work there 

Recording: (7300/ 9621) 
hehe 

Recording: (7301/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7302/ 9621) 
yeah the one thing they have done is they have put on bigger airplanes because it used to be you know like a say a 737 would go from here to new york city and now it is a 757 so that adds more seats so instead of because when i first got there i could not understand it at osu when it was like christmas time or something it would just you drive up and the parking lot was just full of cars and you are like oh boy 

Recording: (7303/ 9621) 
nothing i mean his mom and his dad are cool and 

Recording: (7304/ 9621) 
poor people can not do that so after all was said and done with her case she was left with about a million dollars and then out of that million the attorney and the firm got a third plus she had to pay office expenses so really she was probably left with only about $300000 which if used wisely okay maybe she could have but it sounded to me like she did not have a money problem anyway she was a corporate person but a very stupid person so i mean that is basically my battle with the legal system i have got a person right now that owes me $500 that i wanted to take to small claims court i even got the canceled check to prove it and everything but you know when i look at what the alternative is which is subjecting myself to unfairness even though i feel i got it concrete no way you know those are the ones i mean i would have to pay an attorney and the cheapest one i can find right now is $145 an hour 

Recording: (7305/ 9621) 
it is his dad his dad is dad and his dad is dad 

Recording: (7306/ 9621) 
he takes care of his so to me that is more important 

Recording: (7307/ 9621) 
i tried to wait i guess a couple weeks i will be having another 

Recording: (7308/ 9621)

i think he is done some positive things that whole thing about as far as your student loans and being able to get into scala has helped me as far as some of the issues go i think that i feel pretty similar to the way he does some of his foreign policy things i think have gone pretty decently i i mean i think i do not know i mean i do not know if you really feel like that whole healthcare thing which nothing ever happened with really and i think these people have a lot of really great ideas but they do not ever really put anything into action they just kind of skate along and i do not know if there is anything substantial i can say that was a wonderful thing that you did that i feel very affected by it economy is fine i mean so it is not that he is i feel like he is doing a horrible job but i do not really know how much he is actually doing and i think that unfortunately you spend a lot of your time trying to get out of personal issues that you have gotten yourself into and you can not really focus on anything that is positive that you want to do for the country and i think it is just too bad because i feel like if i was president not that i want to be president but you would have three or four things that you would think were very important you would hire a lot of other people to take care of the other areas people that were very competent that you would feel like they would actually be able to accomplish some things and you would really work to get some stuff done and i do not know if it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i think it is a great question i mean there is so many different issues that people want to look at and you end up focusing on things like philip morris you know which is like the biggest thing in the whole world you know and there is so many other things that i think you could be looking at that are important i just i do not know maybe i mean i am not real up on everything that is been done but i guess it just kind of seems like i wish people would be a little bit more focused and you would be able to say you know there is these three things that i think are really important that i am really going to work to make sure that they get taken care of i just think people kind of ladeedah and say well it is like this you know we will see what we can kind of do about it 

Recording: (7330/ 9621) 
well see my husband would do that it is so bizarre because i honestly do not i think that is where his brain is completely lacking i get to make all the decisions at my house about discipline and about what people can do and can not do and we all understand this and it is perfectly fine and he says i am not a good judge of that you will have to check with because my son was like 11 he let him come to campus with his skateboarding friends i said where are they oh they said they were going down on campus i said on campus how are my dead body he is not allowed down there 

Recording: (7331/ 9621) 
i listen to someone i just touch someone we will be successful you will be successful as an individual and that is what is most critical you yourself has to do it not the business because from you businesses observe 

Recording: (7332/ 9621) 
and we know that the result could be death then like and it is an aggression thing one side will be the aggressor one would obviously because you can not have two aggressive things naturally one would be aggressive and then one would be aggressive in its response you know what i mean so in like a state of war it was like that so in that context i think but like in the same context i feel it would be wrong for a soldier to kill a civilian because they did not decide to become a combatant so if you are a combatant and you make that decision or you are drafted which that is kind of like making the decision in the sense that you were part of that society that got you drafted so if you choose to be part of that society i mean that is a little shadier but still if you both make the desire to do it then so if i were drafted i think i would fight i am sure i would fight for the contract but i do not think i would go i just do not feel the need to go on a rampage or anything 

Recording: (7333/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (7334/ 9621) 
hehe 

Recording: (7335/ 9621)

Recording: (7340/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (7341/ 9621) 
he was in so much trouble and that was the main reason why i did not stay with him he was just draining on me and pulling me down he was never really there he was in and out of jail all the time i would go through the whole bureau of child support that whole thing that was a total mess he wasted all the time to go down there to court appearances and all this other stuff it turned out he could just move 

Recording: (7342/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (7343/ 9621) 
i always wish somebody would do a survey on that and say back in 65 or whatever what is the difference between what they are teaching them then and what they teach them now is it really that or is it just our imagination just do not remember enough but it seems more to me and computers really have helped it 

Recording: (7344/ 9621) 
yeah that is right frank sinatra is the one who was saying i will do it i did it my way and that is really i think the biggest problem in the world today i want to do it my way and you can not or you have got to cooperate with the other person 

Recording: (7345/ 9621)

Recording: (7373/ 9621)

Recording: (7377/ 9621) 
and there is all kinds of things going on i mean if you had the money you could do something every night 

Recording: (7378/ 9621) 
maybe because she says us americans are different 

Recording: (7379/ 9621) 
they were wondering why we were making such a big deal out of it and pretty much all the other problems well there were not really too many other problems i mean the economy is doing really well foreign relations are always shaky but they are getting a little bit better

Recording: (7388/ 9621) 
and they have excellent 

Recording: (7389/ 9621) 
well it is like the 

Recording: (7390/ 9621) 
kind of 

Recording: (7391/ 9621) 
and it was in the butt do not get me wrong he told me he was gonna have me locked up for child abuse so i threw his ass in the car and took him downtown and took him inside and told him to tell them people because they are gonna lock him up 

Recording: (7392/ 9621) 
you know kids they have to learn these things on their own i mean he is 22 i still consider him a kid but they have to learn these things on their own you know when you go to look for a pervert what you need to look for and what you need to check out you know are you going to be able to afford it and everything that goes with it and have a workstudy job you know 

Recording: (7393/ 9621) 
i do not think so i do not think they did but there was this other guy my mom was talking about the other day i do not know what she seen it on i guess he did something like that and he was just listing they did an interview with him and told them how much things he did like he did this and that and i guess he broke into bank once or something like that and got some accounts or something like that i was like whoa yeah that is 

Recording: (7394/ 9621) 
pull out 

Recording: (7395/ 9621) 
media hype 

Recording: (7396/ 9621) 
are not really saying much new where if they have a more compact time they could be so i would like to see them see the time reduced the conventions used to be interesting because they debated the platforms and that is all settled now and it is just sort of this celebration type stuff well that is not interesting they could change and move the primaries like to may 

Recording: (7397/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7398/ 9621) 
i was raised most of my life in ashland it is about ten minutes north of mansfield ohio we moved there from mansfield so i have been living in the mansfieldashland area for 

Recording: (7399/ 9621) 
i think yeah she will 

Recording: (7400/ 9621) 
hmm 

Recording: (7401/ 9621) 
there was an indepth story about that i think it was harper is magazine or what it was in a significant magazine where they had made a study of the new york situation and i found that quite interesting and very very impressive as a matter of fact whatever it was i remember sending it in to the city council of dayton i just addressed it 

Recording: (7402/ 9621) 
she is half naked and she should be a centerfold somewhere and those are little kids yeah disney movies cartoons i mean when you look at that you see it everywhere and it is really scary but nobody is doing anything about it that i can see and they do not really see a concern but like i said wait till the generations start growing up wait till those little kids that we have put all those things in their head grows up then they will think wow we should have done something well i am scared i hope i do not live real long it is scary well and then the guy that i do not even remember what his name was he got a drunk driving charge a judge he was a judge now he is out he went back to work on monday 

Recording: (7403/ 9621) 
highly skilled or trained in that area i mean you can not really do a simple sort of screening and these are good and these are bad and again as i mentioned previously i think it is more to do with maybe being aware of the interaction of you know the different students with each other and i mean if it was as bad as they claimed it to be or as it appeared to be i mean you are never going to get rid of all of that because there are always different groups and different cliques but i can not help but thinking that if it was bad enough that you would do something like that that it had to have been more than just sort of normal jocks versus whatever so i think it should be more i do not know i mean even i went to a private catholic high school but even there there was a sense of that and i mean some of the things that went on should definitely not have been going on and that was only on a very small level there were 86 people in my graduating class and i mean this is a high school with several hundred students that this happened at 

Recording: (7404/ 9621) 
heh heh heh 

Recording: (7405/ 9621) 
you know i said to myself because i had postpartum depression with my third and fourth child and i thought what good am i going to be to these children if i am not able to take care of them so the decision was that after the fourth child we would practice birth control so and i felt comfortable with that 

Recording: (7406/ 9621) 
yeah i usually am not quite there yet not really 

Recording: (7407/ 9621) 
no sunlight you know and they do not give him they keep it warm and he is not allowed sheets or razors you know other than electric razors so he can not kill himself so you are just stuck there is nothing you could do all day for 40 years or however until he naturally dies and that to me would be like that to me is actually like that has to be worse like just the agony and the i think you would have to go insane like there is really so can i would ask for board games or something but he does not even hear a human voice because i think it is something that was written in the scriptures you are dead to the world is the worst that you can do and so the world sees him you know what i mean so that would be rough that would be real rough and so obviously he would want to like they say now people that observe him he sings to himself and he reads the bible every day but i do not know that would be strange it would be such a horrible thing to go through i could not imagine being locked in a room for a few days 

Recording: (7408/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (7409/ 9621) 
16 

Recording: (7410/ 9621) 
a couple three times too but on the phone and everything and then i sat there and said well you can call me every name in the book do whatever the heck you want to but i am still your father 

Recording: (7411/ 9621) 
just one school so that is how many there was 

Recording: (7412/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7413/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7414/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7415/ 9621) 
right yeah yeah that is very true 

Recording: (7416/ 9621) 
let is watch 7 to 9 

Recording: (7417/ 9621) 
we well sort of and kind of yes we were i mean we dated in high school but he ended up going to prom with somebody else so we i mean we went to move went kindergarten all the way through and my sister and his sister were the same age and my mom and his mom or campfire leaders together in the whole bit and then we did not really date in college kind of really did not get together at all freshman year he did go to school here and then as as i said i swam for ohio state and then i went into agler davidson a sporting goods store to buy a swimsuit my sophomore year and he was the cashier there 

Recording: (7418/ 9621) 
eh 

Recording: (7419/ 9621) 
no i am not sending him to a columbus public school but an alternative school i will send him to private school i do not i would if i had the money to tell you the truth i would most definitely but i know i could not afford it that is why i have never thought about it really 

Recording: (7420/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7421/ 9621) 
yeah stay away from salt sodium stuff like that pop coffee i do not have no problem there i do not drink coffee i drink a lot of pop though like pork products 

Recording: (7422/ 9621) 
wow that is great 

Recording: (7423/ 9621) 
and a lot of times unions they actually seem detrimental to production and to the actual individual needs of the members of the union because if a union becomes powerful you can feel free to call off and things like that and that can actually make it worse because then the corporation sees a lazy union as a representative of these workers so they are more apt to go outside 

Recording: (7424/ 9621) 
yeah that would not work 

Recording: (7425/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7426/ 9621) 
i know that is 

Recording: (7427/ 9621) 
bleh 

Recording: (7428/ 9621) 
but i do not think it is bad 

Recording: (7429/ 9621) 
so one day it was a really bad day i would gone to tulsa oklahoma with somebody and came back and like i said i had not had anything to eat the entire day and it was like midnight and i got home and i thought i am too hungry i am too tired and hungry and i just thought i am not making anything so i just went to bed and a guy knocked on my door which he lived upstairs in the apartment above me and he told me are you in there and i would not answer well it was a real cheap apartment he took a credit card and punched the doorknob 

Recording: (7430/ 9621) 
actually i wore out 

Recording: (7431/ 9621) 
a lot of places have these little wellknown hiding spots you know like to try to keep them like a secret away from the tourists 

Recording: (7432/ 9621) 
gays homosexuals and all those 

Recording: (7433/ 9621) 
a few times they did specifically say homosexuality but there were other things that they would cover it is not like it was just an all out assault on being gay or anything like that 

Recording: (7434/ 9621) 
within her life she does more with the children because most of them live here our children are all away 

Recording: (7435/ 9621) 
ok 

Recording: (7436/ 9621) 
i do not know i mean i think it is kind of ridiculous for kids to pay to chew gum you know or if they get caught chewing like desales all my cousins went to desales and if they got caught chewing gum they had to pay 

Recording: (7437/ 9621) 
yeah well like i mean high school has always been really easy and like high school was really easy like i never really felt like challenged even remotely by anything like i mean it is so like high school was kind of like a joke it was real fun and everything you know just to like not really have to do pretty much of anything you know and like so college was a little bit different i mean it was like a little bit more challenging i mean it is basically the same thing in high school you just have less time to do the material you know so it is just like as opposed to having three weeks to doing a paper and doing it the night before you have three days to do it and you still do it the night before it is just like i do not know i thought i just kind of like found out like that i really do not like school and like i want to go back and like having to take math classes again like i just like it is not really my thing like when too my thing i always knew that it would be like this you always have to take basic classes but i was a history major and so it is like i do not care about math at all and anything that i would do would be humanities so it is like 

Recording: (7438/ 9621) 
mmhmm an allwhite jury 

Recording: (7439/ 9621) 
wipe vo 

Recording: (7440/ 9621) 
and the questions are not easy i mean i doubt if i could pass some of them i mean i probably could pass the citizenship and the english and maybe the science because i like science and i keep up on that stuff but i doubt if i could pass the math because i do not teach math and i do not use math that much other than just normal you know add subtract multiply 

Recording: (7441/ 9621) 
i think they lost i think ohio state lost because they was just out there ranting and raving and after a while it got out of hand 

Recording: (7442/ 9621) 
bad acoustics really 

Recording: (7443/ 9621) 
it is different 

Recording: (7444/ 9621) 
i do not think we take up a huge amount and then we get some of the service through ornet as well which is i think it is just up lane avenue they give us the domain name and all that 

Recording: (7445/ 9621) 
like right now their biggest campaign is some elementary school i believe no i think it is a high school and marion was built on an old weapons depot and so like leukemia has risen and so like that is their main campaign now is to inform the public and try and get that changed they have also done other things other they do anything dealing with the environment like exposure things like that so 

Recording: (7446/ 9621) 
over on an adjoining hill oh about half a mile away i guess and he was getting even for the day before 

Recording: (7447/ 9621) 
you alright 

Recording: (7448/ 9621) 
if it is not a necessity i will have to forfeit it right now well a lot of them want the necessities they also want some of the extras and in order to do that both have to work well consequently who is really raising the kids if they are lucky they have got a loving grandparent 99 times out of 100 i do not know if that is a good statistic it is the babysitters or you know these places it is not a babysitter it is a babysitter school or something like that and that is not the same loving cuddling atmosphere that it had when mom was home and able to watch the kids and i think that that is one of the things they can change plus the fact that they changed these stupid tv programs because that is a terrible influence a lot of kids it is taking over their life if it is not that now it is worse yet the kids are on the internet now that is even worse because now you can not even hear what they are getting into at least on tv you could walk in and sit and turn it off now you can go in i guess and see what they are on the internet honestly no sorry you can not in the internet anymore but i think those are all really they can be good influences if they have got the right program and the right person are talking to but too many times it is the other way around 

Recording: (7449/ 9621) 
yes exactly 

Recording: (7450/ 9621) 
i hate my my last name is terrible i hate my last name 

Recording: (7451/ 9621) 
well muggings on the subway or stuff you know just in general 

Recording: (7452/ 9621) 
just general things that i think you should take for granted 

Recording: (7453/ 9621) 
relax get a deadend job that does not come home with me try and pay off my debt and maybe make a little bit so grad school yeah but also enjoy all the things i did not get to do 

Recording: (7454/ 9621) 
aww 

Recording: (7455/ 9621) 
well and they had to cover their hair i know all of that but i do not think that is really been 

Recording: (7456/ 9621) 
or somebody or later they will claim that i was coerced to saying that as i walked out the door you know and it is a big lie 

Recording: (7457/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (7458/ 9621) 
well i know people that sleep outside and not all of them are veterans and everything but there again they do not want to be a part of the quoteunquote sheltered system you know staying in an open shelter voa or something like that 

Recording: (7459/ 9621) 
mm 

Recording: (7460/ 9621) 
and there is lighting effects like strobe lights disco balls 

Recording: (7461/ 9621) 
yeah just since march 

Recording: (7462/ 9621) 
i went to for grade school and for high school 

Recording: (7463/ 9621) 
or does this say this you know this is what i thought this said does that what that really says well here is a perfect example the other day my kids my sixth graders turned in papers on if i could be an animal here is the animal i would be and here is why and they had to research the animal they had like a month to do it and they had to pick any animal and tell about their feeding habits and whether they travel in groups or alone and what part of the world they mostly habitat what they eat all that okay perfect example one of my students wanted to say my animal that i picked lives mostly on vegetables and he could not figure out how to spell it so he went into the computer and he asked it and it gave him the word vestibules 

Recording: (7464/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7465/ 9621) 
oh man 

Recording: (7466/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (7467/ 9621) 
then i 

Recording: (7468/ 9621) 
existing area i mean they could actually well yeah they could actually make it to where they could put homeless people or something feed them or something 

Recording: (7469/ 9621) 
light news that is why i tend to read alternative newspapers and stuff because you do get a different perspective it is probably just slanted but it is different you are right 

Recording: (7470/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7471/ 9621) 
i think so because i 

Recording: (7472/ 9621) 
which is actually a good place for her because a lot of those houses like right around the park of roses and those types of things you can get some that are older that need a lot of work but that is a pretty high demand area 

Recording: (7473/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7474/ 9621) 
i am 

Recording: (7475/ 9621) 
okay that is why they did a lot of like biological studies is that barrier weave okay i have heard of it 

Recording: (7476/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (7477/ 9621) 
you had women working before but selfdiscipline is a brick in our family that is part of it selfdiscipline making things too easy for us oh we can not do without it you ever try to work for something i mean you really struggled to achieve something did it mean more to you than something that was given to you tell me 

Recording: (7478/ 9621) 
well i will have a maybe when i am 100 i will have that figured out 

Recording: (7479/ 9621) 
then my sister lives in the middle of nebraska nobody visits her nobody wants to go to nebraska what is out there come watch the corn grow 

Recording: (7480/ 9621) 
because that is sort of what i found interesting there too i mean there were a lot of jibes about that i remember driving to germany with a couple english friends to visit some german friends of theirs and we got there and we got lost in all these things it took us way longer than it should have and a friend of the person we were visiting said oh what did you have to stop at every mcdonald is along the way and i was like i am a vegetarian i do not even eat at mcdonald is and it was really mean it is like that is not really a very good joke and that kind of thing came up quite frequently but i always said mcdonald is would not survive here if no one ate there and you can not tell me that everyone in there is american 

Recording: (7481/ 9621) 
eh 

Recording: (7482/ 9621) 
well there is the whole thing about the police chief and then there is the whole thing about the federal lawsuit against columbus 

Recording: (7483/ 9621) 
and that is what we are concerned with you need to interact more with people we need to interact more with people every day of our life that is where we learn from we do not learn by giving things to people just like if you are a parent giving allowance you do not give your kids money to do chores they normally expect them to do but you give them something in addition to develop more responsibility but we do not talk about responsibility in our society today i dare you to say where in the heck they say publicly this is our bill of responsibility do you know where there is do we talk about responsibilities now 

Recording: (7484/ 9621) 
yeah and it is not too bad because i had to scratch off your ticket you gave me 

Recording: (7485/ 9621) 
i just well i did not understand as much as you probably do i just was like clueless as to what i needed to do to become an art major and i go to my advisor and they tell me what to take and it was the art advisor but i did not really think i had to do anything special like i did not know about the portfolio review and all that stuff and that was probably my own fault for not asking questions but so it me a while and then i just kind of went to columbus state and went on a mission and came back so i just got accepted into that college but yeah 

Recording: (7486/ 9621) 
stuff like that and i think they might have found like one or two guns so and that to me was but my high school is 2000 people so i guess by sheer numbers one or two persons would bring a gun 

Recording: (7487/ 9621) 
i do i am against religion in school i just do not think they should push that on people i do not think they should make people pray if they do not want to before class or anything like that but as far as morals and the right thing to do in life and what is out there most kids know what the wrong thing is 

Recording: (7488/ 9621) 
i am on the computer at least six hours a day 

Recording: (7489/ 9621) 
that is surprising 

Recording: (7490/ 9621) 
does that make sense 

Recording: (7491/ 9621) 
like just like um like communal showers and stuff and like um just how it is like one room that you like kind of live in or whatever you know it is more like like the army or something you know like real simple everything is real simple and everything is uniform and like i do not know 

Recording: (7492/ 9621) 
and she just came here and lived with me a year ago so she could have her baby here 

Recording: (7493/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7494/ 9621) 
mhm 

Recording: (7495/ 9621) 
yeah i think that is probably you know i am not that familiar with it now but i think that they are getting better and seeing the cracks and things like that that people fall through 

Recording: (7496/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7497/ 9621) 
well i get the sense that if there are discipline problems it is so hard to get anything done to solve them unless somebody brings a gun and waves it around the school that is the big thing now but it is just so hard to get anything done and i think at that point the teachers get frustrated because they do not see the support throughout through the administration they have to wait until something is pretty egregious before it is dealt with 

Recording: (7498/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7499/ 9621) 
i would be a lot happier 

Recording: (7500/ 9621) 
i actually joined the church in well i do not know six years ago about six years ago and they did a survey here at lsu and they were just asking people if they thought that christ had visited america and there was a record of that account do i think that would be important and i was like well i think so yeah but i was kind of hesitant i mean it took me a while i read the book of mormon and i really prayed about it it took me about six months then i finally decided that i really liked it and it was what i had been wanting so that is how i decided 

Recording: (7501/ 9621) 
right because everything that has a coupon has tons of fat tons of sugar and is overpriced 

Recording: (7502/ 9621) 
yeah they yeah she moved in with him 

Recording: (7503/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7504/ 9621) 
sorry 

Recording: (7505/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7506/ 9621) 
so indirectly it was a very bad reason that i came here but it worked out 

Recording: (7507/ 9621) 
blonde haired blue eyed overweight people 

Recording: (7508/ 9621) 
i am just kidding 

Recording: (7509/ 9621) 
we continue merrily on with my day 

Recording: (7510/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (7511/ 9621) 
well not really they have a lot of religious beliefs on their own that they have held on to because they just have had nothing 

Recording: (7512/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7513/ 9621) 
i used to live up there too 

Recording: (7514/ 9621) 
well generally they have some area i do not think i have ever met the kid yet the special kid who has no area that he does not excel in like once i had a sixth grade girl who still did not know her timetables in sixth grade but she had a beverly sills opera voice and in every single school production she was the lead singer i had a girl once that won all kind of medals in gymnastics at the state level it seems like when god takes away from you he gives something back i have had kids who have got every badge you can get in boy scouts and you know i mean there is usually something that they are really it might not be related to school but there is usually something that they are really really good at in some other area like swimming or scouting or whatever so you know but generally speaking they will attack a problem a totally different way than the norm and they will come up with much more creative solutions than a normal person with 100 or 95 iq now i have seen them long to know that and worked with him long enough to know that well i have one boy who can not spell them he still spells it thim and he took my computer apart the other day and adjusted something in the motherboard and put it back together and now it works 

Recording: (7515/ 9621) 
he traced freight whatever that means 

Recording: (7516/ 9621) 
and feeder and i go do not bother me i have had a bad day and i am tired you go watch tv and how are we raising children doing that and people say you have to have both those incomes because we have to do this why do you have to have a house that is $300000 why do you have to have a brand new car is not life sacrifices are not you supposed to do best for your children my children do not have everything they do not have a sega my daughter has a car that goes to and it is 12 years old and i made her buy it i told her i says i will not buy you a car i said if you want a car you have to buy it and i said when it is time for maintenance you have to pay for it because she has to be responsible for things and she appreciates that i admire her she is the person i never was at that age i do not take full responsibility for that 

Recording: (7517/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7518/ 9621) 
no offense 

Recording: (7519/ 9621) 
it really is 

Recording: (7520/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7521/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (7522/ 9621) 
but 

Recording: (7523/ 9621) 
i am going to get done with this i swear 

Recording: (7524/ 9621) 
with there is just a lot there that you know women go through that purification every month so women really do not need the sweat line but it is there for them and they do participate 

Recording: (7525/ 9621) 
but it just depends upon it still comes back to who you are now 

Recording: (7526/ 9621) 
and we were staying at his grandpa is and his grandpa would sit on the back porch and say all kinds of racial slurs towards black people 

Recording: (7527/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (7528/ 9621) 
yes and no they are kind of weird one set of grandparents really i can not hear ever says anything they said on the other side that they are a little bit more racist but at the same time i do not know they almost set up like a double standard for black people there are black people that they really like and i mean they are actually friends with some black people and there are black people that they do not like for whatever the reason may be and those are the people that they are racist towards i mean it is the same thing that goes with white people obviously there are white people that you can stand there are white people that are just obnoxious and you do not want to deal with i mean it is basically the same thing yeah yeah yeah exactly in their heart of hearts you know they are just they are friends with these people because they like them they do not see the fact that they are gay they do not care actually if you ask them they will have gay people that is really funny what about relations between the sexes do you think that we live in a sexist society do you think see guys still being more like the decisionmaking type and as being like the final say in things rather than women and i would see them having an authority figure that is being a woman is causing problems to them 

Recording: (7529/ 9621) 
mmhmm it is real wellknown 

Recording: (7530/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (7531/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7532/ 9621) 
the only thing that was really down there before i moved out was the lincolnlevesque tower the shortest one but of course the university is just about the same in some ways the stadium and all that 

Recording: (7533/ 9621) 
oh yeah we all get together we have to get a shelter house now somewhere because nobody is house is big enough well and then we have so many little kids that it is great because we just go to a shelter inside and they have it for christmas and things like that they can run around the kids run around 

Recording: (7534/ 9621) 
oh my 

Recording: (7535/ 9621) 
right now 

Recording: (7536/ 9621) 
oh yeah yes i what religion are you all that one has all those me this game rules that work out in real life christianity yeah 

Recording: (7537/ 9621) 
break 

Recording: (7538/ 9621) 
oh what are you doing that for 

Recording: (7539/ 9621) 
um not really because i think you know if if they are going to they are going to and i do not think a lot of them at that stage are going to go out of their way to go and buy them so i do not think it is like oh i have a condom i am going to have sex i mean actually this is a very hot topic in england right now because they have got the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in the world and i mean there are stories everywhere about 12yearolds having babies and i mean there they have gone to distributing condoms on playgrounds which i do think is a little bit too much i think maybe having them available in the nurse is office is one thing they are there they can go in and get some or something but i think actually physically passing them out is a bad idea but demonstrating and that kind of thing i think is pretty important just because of the simple fact of the statistics that they are doing it so at the very least they might as well be safe about it 

Recording: (7540/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (7541/ 9621) 
yeah she still lives with family 

Recording: (7542/ 9621) 
because then you know what if something major happens that fourth time then what but i think at least for children especially because they have no means to help themselves and like the parents obviously even if they are working a lot of times can not get health care for their children so i think at least for children because how many accidents happen to children like people are always breaking arms and stuff 

Recording: (7543/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7544/ 9621) 
i do not know anything about the starbuck oh man do not let the shirt fool you 

Recording: (7545/ 9621) 
i think they are retired teachers or people on maybe the board at different school districts or i do not know 

Recording: (7546/ 9621) 
sure 

Recording: (7547/ 9621) 
you problems you and i are going to be the laughingstock of the corporate america and you really think you and i want to do that so to me nobody is gonna have a problem because years they are gonna go remember bank one you know you go get ten bucks and you get 500 out of the machine duh you know it is like who wants to do business with nobody is gonna do that you know maybe some little company um that really does not you know have a big impact but i do not see where anything is gonna happen at all you know 

Recording: (7548/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7549/ 9621) 
but she likes the spirituality of the community over there 

Recording: (7550/ 9621) 
if it does not affect them it is not there and if they do not have to 

Recording: (7551/ 9621) 
they do not get i do not think they get federal funding i think they get a little bit from the ohio arts council and they raise money from the businesses in the community plus we charge for tickets for people to come and see us and sometimes we get a lot sometimes we do not get so many turns out the concerts we get the most the biggest audience for are the christmas concerts where we have the children is choir 

Recording: (7552/ 9621) 
no i am not really up on the coaching thing i mean anybody can coach a game it takes players to play the game 

Recording: (7553/ 9621) 
he wants to yeah 

Recording: (7554/ 9621) 
i think they have got more money i do not know if that necessarily makes them a better school i think a lot of it is really what you as far as a parent is what you expect your children to achieve in school and what they want to get out of it you know my family my brothers and sisters they all went to public schools and they took advanced ap classes and they worked real hard and they have got i think that they have options 

Recording: (7555/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7556/ 9621) 
okay well a few years ago there was this big fuss you know we have got to close some schools enrollment is dropping it is just the way the population goes enrollment is dropping we can not afford to keep them all going so let us close and they did this big study and they targeted some to close well there was a big uproar from the people whose kids went to that school like there will be whenever you close the school so the board backed down and changed its mind the next year they came out with a study saying they need more schools but there was not the money for it so there was a big fuss about that then two years later they came out with another study that says well they need to refurbish some schools close a couple and then knock some down and rebuild them and it is like every two years it is a different direction and it is like they are almost afraid to take a stand that somebody is not going to like well if you are going to shut a school down somebody is going to be really ticked off 

Recording: (7557/ 9621) 
yeah i have run into that a lot i think part of it was the high school i went to i mean i have gone to catholic schools all my life or whatever and obviously i have run into a lot more of the wealthier type people who either just do not have time or do not have the interest and just pay people to do it 

Recording: (7558/ 9621) 
it is like sometimes i think about people you know they call and especially when i talk to sometimes people call in and i talk you know i get the same people or whatever every once in a while especially if like there is people that have real specific weird names or something that i can remember they will call back and i will think about them it is like how i have this you know it is like we have this weird like five minute relationship or something like that like every couple of weeks or something and it is like to think about what their life is like and what they are actually like and you know it is like so weird it is like i do not know yeah everybody 

Recording: (7559/ 9621) 
at the beginning he did perfectly but now he is doing this i want up at four oclock kind of thing and give him a bottle and he goes back to sleep i do not want to walk all the way downstairs to make a bottle for him at four oclock i can not see filling my way through the hallways and stuff 

Recording: (7560/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7561/ 9621) 
oh really 

Recording: (7562/ 9621) 
right and it is sometimes that opens the person up because a child they are so innocent and you can not help but love them and i know my mom had a big problem with the whole interracial 

Recording: (7563/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (7564/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7565/ 9621) 
yeah he was he is going to always be real i like that he is got his yeah 

Recording: (7566/ 9621) 
actually i went back to i came back to ohio state in let us see 93 through 95 and got a teaching certificate in science for secondary science and i taught for a year at a small school in lancaster a catholic high school down there left there part of it was my fault i was not very good at discipline in the classroom so that was probably one of the biggest problems i had 

Recording: (7567/ 9621) 
yeah just had to leave me here we have been best friends for so many years 

Recording: (7568/ 9621) 
no that is interesting though because i think that my whole i mean i always still i still feel like i am just 

Recording: (7569/ 9621) 
well i was in management for about 13 14 years and it was not bad where i was before this management was it was the whole department it was i do not know what it was people they were always arguing and fighting it was just the whole atmosphere of that place and it was just people that i would known for years and gotten along well with were just they were different when they went in there they just changed it was just it was just not a good place to work 

Recording: (7570/ 9621) 
now that does not make any extra work for the teacher but it gives him a shot he usually will answer the concepts he will usually answer the main stuff that he knows and if you only grade him on that he might have a shot at a c or a b i mean there is all kind of ways to modify give a reduced work amount give a kid a copy of another student is notes if his are crummy and he can not study from them we even have a thing at our school that looks just like notebook paper and it is got three holes in the lines and every teacher has a stack of it on their desk but it is ncr you know the two copies of the 

Recording: (7571/ 9621) 
i mean we throw the book away on some of these other guys i mean we throw the cue away on some of these guys and you know we want to set them as an example and you know this one guy had one dui two years ago so he is got to be in jail for five years then this judge i mean he is got probably ten years of history with drugs and alcohol and he is still a judge monday morning he goes to work 

Recording: (7572/ 9621) 
it is in the accounting department 

Recording: (7573/ 9621) 
you know it happened like in the same year 88 you know but it was pretty tough but i just did not deal with it properly you know i should have went and got counseling well i probably should have got marriage counseling but i refused to do that too so i did not think i had a problem with it she was a wonderful woman 

Recording: (7574/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7575/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7576/ 9621) 
i went to the they got a food one over here by the vet clinic 

Recording: (7577/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (7578/ 9621) 
okay

Recording: (7580/ 9621) 
hmm 

Recording: (7581/ 9621)

i heard like i would never been there but i heard like new york do not even do not even ask a stranger because they will not even talk to you they will not look at you you know like on new york city 

Recording: (7591/ 9621) 
and not that that changed my opinion of her but back then and nobody would talk about it and i just think in today is world we need to bring subjects like that out knowing because there is so many people who are ashamed about things and they should not be ashamed because it is a lifestyle anymore it needs to be brought up more 

Recording: (7592/ 9621) 
hahahaha 

Recording: (7593/ 9621) 
the pizza is really cheap

yeah my brotherinlaw was very much opposed to any kind of gun control the whole family was hunters and things like that my fatherinlaw was a hunter but he was not opposed to gun control either as long as he could hunt 

Recording: (7597/ 9621) 
it was a real tight job market for librarians 

Recording: (7598/ 9621) 
i do not know i think you just kind of deal with it when it gets here though 

Recording: (7599/ 9621) 
i was there for almost a month did one of those tours where you get on the bus and did the london and the france and the italy and the holland 

Recording: (7600/ 9621) 
yes i do i have a brother and two sisters 

Recording: (7601/ 9621) 
my favorite character on that show had always been chakotay and i do not like how his character has been portrayed in the recent couple of seasons i like the fact that he was someone who had been a starfleet officer but because of a matter of principle left starfleet joined the maquis but was still fundamentally an honorable person and had to deal with being welcomed back into the fold of starfleet by being first officer on the ship but still had to balance his new life i saw so much potential for interesting stuff with it but i feel that he is become just another character to deliver lines for most of the episodes that i have seen from this past season i stopped 

Recording: (7602/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (7603/ 9621) 
it was just yeah i guess the mafia was a big problem they just take over everything and they do not pay their workers and most people are not mafia so they do not get paid 

Recording: (7604/ 9621) 
you know for me getting out of bed is a victory you know for the longest time i was so depressed you know but the animals you know yeah using the animals for therapy animal therapy i mean dogs in particular cats but you know there is some animals that are not to be pets they are wild animals i saw a show last week on fox that was called when good pets go bad too

Recording: (7607/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (7608/ 9621)

Recording: (7609/ 9621) 
an urban area 

Recording: (7610/ 9621) 
most of the trouble i have i got one neighbor that hates me and he is a sharer 

Recording: (7611/ 9621) 
yeah they are worried about you and then it just taken off and what were they not even a half an hour or whatever out in the ocean were out over the ocean and all wants to play went woman 30 seconds or something i mean it was down from what was it 30000 feet or something so well they must have they would had to been dead before they reached the water because of that sudden decline more that make you pass out if nothing else would and there now they are trying to decide was it sabotage was there something wrong with the plane was it pallet air and so i do not know if there is going to be more sabotage stuff going on the way some of those countries fight over there and the other countries and try to get us involved i do not know i hope not i pray to god to something then all the good people are trying to say no god is going to come back and salvage the world you know all the good people will be here and probably the bad people maybe he will take the good people and make it a better world for us and the rest of them will suddenly die i do not know 

Recording: (7612/ 9621) 
what instrument do you play 

Recording: (7613/ 9621) 
which consists of art 162 through art 260

maybe i will move to australia 

Recording: (7615/ 9621) 
they had all that white sand and that water you could see down for miles 

Recording: (7616/ 9621)

Recording: (7619/ 9621) 
yeah i remember political correctness

there was one where they were going along and there is a little scroungy looking dog about so long and about that high kind of following along after him joe i am glad that i finally see somebody i can be sorry for he is worse off than i am 

Recording: (7624/ 9621) 
i really 

Recording: (7625/ 9621) 
i really think civil rights have gone too far because for every rule that says you cannot do this to the other person there is another rule that says that is okay if that other person does it to you i mean my mother used to say for every law that was written there is another law written over here that will actually nullify that one and actually as i have grown older i found it is worse in today is world as i said as the civil rights move rights move it and you have a right to this and you have a right to that it is terrible murderers get away with murder now by that plea bargain that plea bargain i think is the most thing that ever was passed i do not think there should be any plea bargains and then there are people who get murdered and sent to electric chair electric chair i still believe in it because if someone is proven and i do not believe that they should have ten years of what do they call that legal process where they can bring appeals thank you that is it i do not think that you should have that either one appeal or two should be the limit if they are still found guilty sorry and if an innocent person has not been able to prove he is innocent that is just one of those freaky things that happens because sometimes innocent people do pay the penalty for someone else that is guilty that is corrupt enough in his mind that he knows how to get away with it and get somebody else to take his blame but i do not think there is that many innocent people that ever went to the electric chair that they should actually have nullified that because what right does that person have to live tv just about two or three days ago and here is this guy down the south end and as he is walked out handcuffed behind him and they are putting him to cruiser well i did do exactly what i said i was gonna do i was gonna watch her draw her last breath he killed her now he is gonna go and probably maybe a plea bargain and he will get off with it because maybe he was abused as a child and that had something to do with the way he was thinking what happened to this woman because of it i am sorry let him pay the penalty and if more people paid the penalty there would be more people thinking twice three four times before they did the same thing and that would help i think to stop some of that 

Recording: (7626/ 9621) 
that is exactly what it is 

Recording: (7627/ 9621) 
well i do not know that that is a cause they as a group this was kind of a happenstance this occurred as a result of a very major world war so in terms of them causing it it was a happenstance and part of this mass communication we are talking about began with them and yes they are a major influence because we are talking about numbers and you are talking about greater intercommunication i would like to go back one step where we are talking about when i made mention that three doors down you do not even know who that individual is and i wanna stick with that i think that is profound as an individual communication we are nearing zero in terms of global mass communication to everybody with interpersonal communications that is the key in my opinion personal versus interpersonal communications and it is zero over here and we are almost 100 over here but when we are in this interpersonal or global or massive whichever term is the most appropriate john doe who speaks here he has not the faintest idea who jane doe is over here on the personal it used to be that yeah you knew who this person was over here that is jane doe that lives in that third house and she married henry jackson do not you remember old henry well henry was a guy live way over there and the other side of town mass communications as it is today i have not the faintest idea where jane came from or where henry jackson or where old whoever he was lived over there i said so i think i think you need to distinguish between the personal interpersonal relationship so maybe i die crash too far there or who the next door neighbor is 

Recording: (7628/ 9621) 
i see i am gonna have to fall way back and show my age again as most people would say i i would really like to see this to happen but i also know that it motion it will never happen within the next three or four generations but i i am of a guy who still believes that the lady has a place in her home and i do not believe that we need a man and wife out working and making incomes as everyone in the united states today feels they must hazel hit upon it rather lightly a while ago and was talking about need versus luxuries i want i want i want well my judgment is that we are spending today probably 80 of the income on things that they want and only 20 on what they need and that is all they need to spend on that need so therefore the pardon 

Recording: (7629/ 9621) 
yeah i am opposed to parental consent but i do not have kids so that opinion does not mean as much as it might from someone who did 

Recording: (7630/ 9621) 
i had not heard that some of it when clinton is backed down i think i sort of summarized what i just said is for the health insurance and reform of all that health insurance he backed down but it was not going to happen so he could keep the furor going for months and months or years and still nothing was going to happen it was the wrong time or we try to move on to something else i think it is regrettable it has not come back like you said it is like well we made the one attempt and it did not go anywhere so let us let it drop it is a count for somebody else to pick it up well clinton is a lame duck why can not he bring it back 

Recording: (7631/ 9621) 
i do not think so 

Recording: (7632/ 9621) 
yeah just having fun 

Recording: (7633/ 9621) 
i 

Recording: (7634/ 9621) 
i do not think it ever really occurred to me 

Recording: (7635/ 9621) 
in first grade his teacher knew that he needed that but the principal would not allow her to do it and that is one reason we put him in a different school for second grade 

Recording: (7636/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (7637/ 9621) 
and then in a little bit there is another one the other side of us 

Recording: (7638/ 9621) 
what happened was we know one of the people on our committee teaches in the math department here 

Recording: (7639/ 9621) 
you know when she is in her middle years and tamara when she is you know but you know i finally decided why people go so crazy with this name thing it is the one thing in life we get to do where there is no restrictions no laws nobody gives you any limitations or parameters they just say go for it and people just go nuts with it 

Recording: (7640/ 9621) 
they do not have nothing like that nowadays somebody fall through the ice and they would sue them 

Recording: (7641/ 9621) 
yeah she does she comes back a lot 

Recording: (7642/ 9621) 
in fact helet us see i do not remember but i suppose that they had a draft when he was about 21 

Recording: (7643/ 9621) 
i like looking at the stories from a different perspective as a kid 

Recording: (7644/ 9621) 
that is because their parents are rich 

Recording: (7645/ 9621) 
a little less romantic 

Recording: (7646/ 9621) 
and the thing that was always cool about my mom is if it was somebody that was not real nice to me or that i did not really like she would not have anything to do with them i mean the whole thing was you know if i approved of this person 

Recording: (7647/ 9621)

Recording: (7653/ 9621) 
if you just said take or get i just i say well i am just going to because when you get out in the work world there is going to be two things they care about about your writing is it usable and is it persuasive because usually when you are writing something in the workplace it is either to explain something or it is to persuade somebody to do something so if it is not those two things it is not writing that is going to make it in the world 

Recording: (7654/ 9621) 
you know society again is taking away everything from you 

Recording: (7655/ 9621) 
mmhmm i did 

Recording: (7656/ 9621) 
that is where you need to correct you can not just say hey we got a schnook out here we can screw him that is a problem and you are saying does it take home does it take church it takes morals and that is why i was telling you before we got away from morals in our society we could care less about you i always say a good successful salesman will be able to sell his own mother i mean sell his own mother on the market 

Recording: (7657/ 9621) 
beer bottles sure do 

Recording: (7658/ 9621)

Recording: (7659/ 9621) 
since 74 yeah 

Recording: (7660/ 9621) 
yeah yeah they have had two different articles in there about it well they had a big article back when who was it jesse jackson was down there or something a couple years ago or something and he made a concerted effort to try to let people know how much poverty was down there and everything but then you go to a lot of other extremes you know where you sit there and these people would not want to live in columbus so you know you could give them a million dollar house up here and an income for the rest of their life they do not want that they want to live down where they feel comfortable with 

Recording: (7661/ 9621) 
maybe at the underlying base 

Recording: (7662/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (7663/ 9621) 
cry 

Recording: (7664/ 9621) 
mhmm

Recording: (7672/ 9621) 
i went to a lot of them middle school i went to clinton and indianola high school i went to brookhaven and fort hayes 

Recording: (7673/ 9621) 
right right it is not an analytical process it is analytical in the sense of controlling your mouth and your hand and the bell and that kind of thing to get what you want to come out but it is not analytical in terms of finger combinations no not so much 

Recording: (7674/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7675/ 9621)

child care 

Recording: (7683/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7684/ 9621) 
what we should buy yeah the retail what we should buy and that is the problem we listen to business too much if business reemphasized their goals to help society out and not themselves 

Recording: (7685/ 9621) 
you know anything probably no you know so 

Recording: (7686/ 9621) 
it will be a long campaign i thought it was interesting that gore suggested two debates a week and i just can not imagine watching two debates a week for months at least they could get things out into the open they had the chance but who wants to watch that much who has the time to watch that much 

Recording: (7687/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (7688/ 9621) 
well yeah in a case like that the parents should know because there is something going on 

Recording: (7689/ 9621) 
and they collect the cards 

Recording: (7690/ 9621) 
people would knock on the door and they would yell that they were not home or something 

Recording: (7691/ 9621) 
see now 

Recording: (7692/ 9621) 
emma is sort of a timeless name in that it is you know been around for a long time yet people do not associate it with old women because there are still emmas today 

Recording: (7693/ 9621)

Recording: (7697/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (7698/ 9621)

Recording: (7699/ 9621) 
hehe 

Recording: (7700/ 9621) 
and to see what else happens i mean from what i know this story was kind of happy and in many ways a children is story but what has to happen within the larger story between now and the end of episode three is the republic falls and the empire takes over and all the jedi are killed by this cute little eightyearold kid 

Recording: (7701/ 9621) 
my oldest son was in vietnam 

Recording: (7702/ 9621) 
i am originally from indiana but i lived up in amherst ohio i lived there for about four years and then i because i worked at a place called cleveland center which is an air route traffic control center and i moved from there to ohio state airport and i worked there for 19 years and then i transferred to port columbus 

Recording: (7703/ 9621) 
yeah we was going up there to i can not really remember it is been 20 years ago and i just do not have any real recollection 

Recording: (7704/ 9621) 
i love it when people come from out of town because then i get to try new places and i am way behind i need more company 

Recording: (7705/ 9621) 
to get bags of apples and chicken sandwiches and apple juice but then here comes cooper is wife and his daughter and like his son and i am thinking they are putting all his family up in this hotel the night before a game i mean i do not know i just thought it was very strange that he would have his whole family staying there with him when none of those boys get to bring anybody you know what i mean 

Recording: (7706/ 9621) 
you know before they tell you this was last summer and it was on a vacation to myrtle beach they are telling you about the surfboard that they got and how great they surfed when that really should come down in the body of the paper you know most people just they assume the reader knows i always say to my kids pretend like you are writing for an alien 

Recording: (7707/ 9621) 
well my son he worked on the coleman campaign so of course you know i had to get out and you know help put the signs out and all that kind of stuff i got the bumper sticker got some people in my family some bumper stickers some neighbors 

Recording: (7708/ 9621) 
and you know i would show up at their house if i thought something was going on you know it do not matter to me i am just like i said i grew up here in columbus ohio i am just a dumb hillbilly you know like if they were having a party at somebody is house and their parents did not know i would show up there and ask them what the hell was going on 

Recording: (7709/ 9621) 
yeah i mean a lot of people really that i knew anyway did not know about ecstasy until they saw that movie and then it was the whole talk of high school whatever 

Recording: (7710/ 9621) 
i am not agreeing with my grandma she seems to think okay maybe but if you put a discount store in there i would love it that is what she said i was like okay 

Recording: (7711/ 9621) 
oh yeah i would say so 

Recording: (7712/ 9621) 
yeah there was a lot of positive things from it as far as discipline as far as growing up faster and everything sometimes when i see more like my daughter or like other people that age and everything they tend to act grown up where i felt like i was forced to grow up 

Recording: (7713/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (7714/ 9621) 
kept i want the cars we do not talk about buying cars nowadays we talk about leasing cars and pretty soon we are not going to be buying houses we will be leasing houses from the finance companies we will not be owning the land the finance company owns it you do not own it you are leasing it and that is our quality of life and when we go to third world countries we say i do not know how they can stand living here and yet you know what they probably have better quality of understanding one another than we do because i feel like the more you get closer to one another the further you become apart 

Recording: (7715/ 9621) 
and then i have a daughter in tulsa oklahoma and i have a daughter in reston virginia so they did they are all married well three are married yeah 

Recording: (7716/ 9621) 
and it kind of worked out because her husband was losing his job anyhow just kind of one of those okay let us do it 

Recording: (7717/ 9621) 
she is got like a third grade education she is like a kid herself 

Recording: (7718/ 9621) 
yeah i have not i really have not even have not even given it that much thought yet 

Recording: (7719/ 9621) 
or they did not say loud enough that you had the right to well i was never told i had the right i never was told i could make the phone call and if they can convince them and the poor policeman can i think really what they ought to start doing is taping everything that is said and taping it so it is so clear that there is no way that they can deny it and then yet they have got that thing loud it is illegal civil rights you can not tape what i am saying it is like can we paper for you then get them to get them to sign when they go in there you fully understand now what we are going to do and if boy if they say then they really make it so and ask them two or three times on tape that they understand this before they sign this even well then how could they say that they they have got to come up with new rules and they got to make the penalty stick 

Recording: (7720/ 9621) 
which we encourage that 

Recording: (7721/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7722/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7723/ 9621) 
mhm 

Recording: (7724/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7725/ 9621) 
he cleans the toilet too because he is a boy and boys even some men do not quite 

Recording: (7726/ 9621) 
starting over means putting a new operating system on it 

Recording: (7727/ 9621) 
you are really smart no you are not dumb but they sit in class and they see their friends just catch on to things and that they can not do and so then they say well my parents are just saying that because they love me i am really stupid you know and you have to actually show them when they get to be this age that look you have 117 iq 

Recording: (7728/ 9621) 
i am 

Recording: (7729/ 9621) 
ha ha ha 

Recording: (7730/ 9621) 
hmm 

Recording: (7731/ 9621) 
price is so high 

Recording: (7732/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (7733/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (7734/ 9621) 
so they could not go in that direction they would have to just bring in new people which i think probably would not be a good idea 

Recording: (7735/ 9621) 
correct 

Recording: (7736/ 9621) 
well i think it is true you do not vote because you think i do not want either one of these people what does it matter 

Recording: (7737/ 9621) 
i do not know where he lives now but yeah i have seen him live before 

Recording: (7738/ 9621)

Recording: (7740/ 9621) 
i do not allow no hitting no you know and she kind of lets it get away she lets him be a little rough because he is a boy but i do not 

Recording: (7741/ 9621) 
right it is bad it is bad on the other hand it is not good to let your mind wander off somewhere i find myself having to focus sometimes i mean to really um-hum 

Recording: (7742/ 9621) 
uh huh uh-huh 

Recording: (7743/ 9621) 
and they will ignore them will not they because they are in their good sunday clothes 

Recording: (7744/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7745/ 9621) 
and how many dollars does a consumer put into research as opposed to the business that is the inequity in our life and you are basically putting a shaft to the consumer 

Recording: (7746/ 9621) 
they say oh no we do not want all right say let us get a foreign exchange student this would be fun 

Recording: (7747/ 9621) 
yeah when you have that many animals you know people 

Recording: (7748/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (7749/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7750/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7751/ 9621) 
yeah you are not alone 

Recording: (7752/ 9621) 
it is over off of 33 270 and 33 

Recording: (7753/ 9621) 
i am always lived in ohio so i am a native ohioan southern ohio right now i am staying at home with my two boys i have a one year old and a five year old where do you believe in breastfeeding from birth to whenever and holding you know like carrying the baby in a sling with you and just being available for the baby is needs and just no not really i feel a huge difference for me personally just in the closeness and being able to pick up on his cues a lot better and just knowing his needs 

Recording: (7754/ 9621) 
i believe them i do it is a very personal thing and if that is what they saw most of my patients are head traumas so they can come up with some pretty wild stories but those visions are usually pretty clear 

Recording: (7755/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7756/ 9621) 
no it would probably be something with his foreign policy or domestic policy that would change my mind 

Recording: (7757/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7758/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7759/ 9621) 
there is not a lot around you know and we were on the list forever we were on the list five years before we had our first kids yeah and they call them well you still want to be on the list yeah we do not have any children but keep us on the list you know and it is like you say and there is 300 or 400 kids in that daycare it is a large daycare but there is not a lot out there that is good quality i mean it is scary and then you see in the news they were abusing the kids you know and you do not want to go to work feeling that you are worrying about your kids and we have never really felt like that and we kind of work a little different shifts my wife and i so our kids are only actually there about five hours a day because she does not start till 930 and i pick them up at four 

Recording: (7760/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7761/ 9621) 
i was real negative she is real negative about things and tries to put me down for being positive i always see a way out of something and she does not i think she gets kind of mad plus she feels like she is old at 50 i said oh my gosh you do not even have any bad habits i said you could live to be 100 that is 50 more years if you look at it that way 50 is not old at all to me i mean that is just as much as you learn you know you can not trade that but yeah my one sister that is exactly seven years older than me we are the closest and then the sister that is two years older than me she is the same way she does a lot of things that i am like why are you doing that you know do not do that do that so she pretty much stays low and depressed a lot because of everything she goes through 

Recording: (7762/ 9621) 
yeah she had a talk and my sister and i attended and i do not like the problem i think with universal health care would be everyone do not you think like everyone with a little scratch would go in you know as opposed to like the very and i think that could drive costs up so there has to be a way to balance i am not sure how you would go about doing that because you do not want to put a limit and say okay you can only go three times a year 

Recording: (7763/ 9621) 
read the paper and have the tv off there is something i think i might want to i might be interested in so i just do all those things and do my machine 

Recording: (7764/ 9621) 
i do not know i think i really do not know i think in today is world what they call the 90s that it is just like everything has changed like when i grew up we kids that grew up when we grew up and everything else we had standards and there were certain things we did or did not do and then it came along that when our kids grew up then there were so many things that changed one thing that stands out and this has nothing to do with politics but it is an example in school they changed the way they were doing their mathematics i could not even help my kids with their mathematics sometimes and i took geometry and algebra you would think i used to use straight a is in algebra when i got to geometry i thought why am i taking this that was not so good but still the way they were teaching it now and they are teaching it entirely different now and i think linda explained to how they were doing with matthew and said she could not even help him and so you know it is in the same way politics it people i guess change over the years their outlook on life changes or their whatever changes and i think it is to me it is getting worse but then my mother used to say the same thing about our generation so i think it is just a sign of the times i do not know what it is 

Recording: (7765/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7766/ 9621) 
all the way over to 11th avenue man that was a hot day too

all i remember is them talking about condoms i do not think they talked about anything besides that but then again i could be remembering wrong but yes it is the stance but i think in the schools that is sort of like the hard line of the catholic church but in the more progressive schools they are a little bit more realistic i mean this was not i mean it was the catholic school but we did not have nuns or anything there i mean you know i think they were sort of more concerned with you know actually it might have been later than the first sex education we had that young i mean it might have been more like a couple like eighth grade that they talked about condoms i doubt that they would have done that that early now that i think about it but i know that there was at one point you know some sort of

Recording: (7820/ 9621) 
london paris prague budapest amsterdam venice vienna berlin munich there is probably some more on there but that is all the ones that jump off there is like a little hit list in my head obviously and another hit list in my palm pilot and life is good 

Recording: (7821/ 9621) 
and i just told them what it has to do with my belief system so you are in violation of the first amendment and then they realized that i was not stupid so they just made things more and more difficult for me so i just decided to since they were not gonna change i was just gonna leave so it is a hard way to choose to walk if you are an idealistic person i mean just more so me to it is also very easy to get sucked into the attitude well i am going to change this you know if you can you do what you can do as a human being that alone is good enough 

Recording: (7822/ 9621) 
i have been there twice already 

Recording: (7823/ 9621)

i do not know what it is like to grow up anywhere else i know what it is like kind of like where my cousin lived in new york because i would go there in the summers but did i like growing up in columbus how do you judge that you know what do you compare that to 

Recording: (7826/ 9621) 
mostly accounting and things like that such as accounts receivable for nursing homes and things like that pretty indepth some of the day by you know if i just go for a day it is filing and whatnot getting phones but most of the jobs actually you learn a lot so 

Recording: (7827/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7828/ 9621) 
161 was like you know all new and this is the place i want to live you know 

Recording: (7829/ 9621) 
mhm 

Recording: (7830/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (7831/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (7832/ 9621) 
but even though you are not responsible i am the one that is supposed to be responsible the people that have the beer party in the house yeah they should be held responsible to some degree but we are in a society that loves to sue people 

Recording: (7833/ 9621) 
well i always look back and look at this there were how many thousands maybe millions of years before christ and here we are 2000 years after christ what makes us think we are not going to live those 10 15 20 50000 years beyond i can not believe unless there is some thing like us our planet colliding with another planet or something that would destroy everything 

Recording: (7834/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7835/ 9621) 
you know these apartments where he is living in is just god i mean it seems like 100 years old 

Recording: (7836/ 9621)

Recording: (7837/ 9621) 
well i think 

Recording: (7838/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7839/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (7840/ 9621) 
understanding 

Recording: (7841/ 9621) 
and oh they saw the ragged end of the war 

Recording: (7842/ 9621) 
oh it does yeah 

Recording: (7843/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (7844/ 9621) 
yeah he uses a lot of different slurs towards gay people 

Recording: (7845/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (7846/ 9621) 
and her family 

Recording: (7847/ 9621) 
get paid every week for doing nothing 

Recording: (7848/ 9621) 
because heck it is sydney it is like a tourist place 

Recording: (7849/ 9621) 
and his report card he is got like a 125 average so they take jelena who has an a him who has a d and they go well gee the average kid in this school is like c plus and they are stupid at this school columbus public schools do not do any good then you go to dublin worthington and westerville in order to get there you are not gonna be in his condition and you are not gonna be stupid because you are trying to you know probably both husband and wife work so the intelligence is there and you are not going to have dumb people living and going to those schools because it is very expensive to live in that area so there is a natural prejudice that columbus is stupid and worthy to dublin and it is really not true it is just that you know you can not tell all the poor people and the people who do not have two parents do not come to school because we want our scores higher but you know when the news media goes look how bad brown school did this year but they do not look to see like jelena they do not go well look at the scores on the california achievement test there is like 75 of the kids that are getting like you know 90s and above but 25 are getting f is and d is and 

Recording: (7850/ 9621) 
yeah i mean i know so many people who when they get pregnant are so conscientious about what they eat and i mean they will not take antihistamines in hay fever season and so many things that they will not do and they are so conscientious about it it is hard for me i mean i just do not know anybody who smoked when they were pregnant or anything like that on the other hand i think it is a choice and i mean you want to try to help them you want to make them aware of health issues but i mean a lot of women are not getting prenatal care either and that is part of it and you can not arrest them for that you just got to get them to the doctor 

Recording: (7851/ 9621) 
and so you keep thinking well you know they need more but i was hoping they could use that land for something else i do not know there is you know there is so many not building but you know something maybe especially in dublin but it is probably will be good for columbus 

Recording: (7852/ 9621) 
see 

Recording: (7853/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7854/ 9621) 
much more widely used once you get into college but i mean as far as like the pot and just things like that i mean i can not say i see any difference between

also too when is the last time you have seen a baseball game kids playing a baseball game in the neighborhood 

Recording: (7864/ 9621) 
right anybody with that bush 

Recording: (7865/ 9621) 
i said there is a big 

Recording: (7866/ 9621) 
if you work at a college or a hospital you make no money yeah pretty much it seems like it i wanted to for a long time now i am just not so sure that i want the two or three more years of school they suggest two to three years for your phd i do not want to do that 

Recording: (7867/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7868/ 9621) 
i just had a healthy vigorous conversation last night with a township trustee jersey township which is just over in licking county and this gentleman is 83 or 4 years of age and he is been a township trustee various times throughout his life and he is very very concerned because of the exploding pot and hit boy should be back up he is a farmer has been a farmer all of his life he owns about a hundred and fifty acres adjacent to approximately a thousand which his son is predominantly operating yet he goes out and works to help out at eight at this age but he is concerned because they have just recently passed an ordinance within the county which allows developers to come in and already they are ready to take over a couple of farms that are fairly close to him but but it affects the whole township and one of the things that they left out as he put it one of the ordinances that he pushed and pushed and pushed he wanted a specific part of that ordinance to say every so many people that move into this area you must provide for a school and he said of consequence and he said they did not do it he said i push and push and he said all the influence was on the side to get more houses get more houses because it was gonna produce more taxes but they kept saying well what do you want these taxes for if you are not gonna provide for schools so he was very concerned about that so so here was a case in my opinion a very very honest politician but he was also being shoved away from what he felt was an honest approach 

Recording: (7869/ 9621) 
well clown cone is not there anymore clown cone you could get like a bag of tootsie rolls and pay only five cents so that is gone and that was a kid thing my grandfather used to own nmm market 

Recording: (7870/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7871/ 9621) 
yeah the medical school has pretty much limited them to 10 of the 

Recording: (7872/ 9621) 
do your thing 

Recording: (7873/ 9621) 
i do think there is some and i do not think they would probably get exposed to the different walks of life i do not think they would probably be exposed to the gay lesbian i think that would probably just be blown over and they did not go very much in depth about sex and your sex ed classes were pretty but on the other hand for me that was fine i do not know our friends that have an 11yearold that is going to going to public school i mean he had a parenting class already where he had to carry around this baby he went we went to a hockey game with him and here he is with this baby at this hockey game and it was just like at 11 

Recording: (7874/ 9621) 
yeah he went to columbus public schools well you know i am catholic and i went to catholic schools and so i tried that with both my kids catholic schools for a couple years and so he was in a catholic school a couple years but he got expelled because he is adhd 

Recording: (7875/ 9621)

Recording: (7878/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (7879/ 9621) 
there was other things right yeah like we had our service we would clean up neighborhoods yeah there was a lot of different things 

Recording: (7880/ 9621) 
so she is doing that 

Recording: (7881/ 9621) 
so i can sleep in 

Recording: (7882/ 9621) 
it all gets i do not know it all works itself out every other day you start him on taxes and he will just start fuming 

Recording: (7883/ 9621) 
i do not actually think that i could call myself an engineer amongst engineers but i think if i was calling myself an engineer or a psychologist it would be okay 

Recording: (7884/ 9621) 
i did not like his last middle name 

Recording: (7885/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (7886/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7887/ 9621) 
like it is everything pretty i mean like basic stuff that you it would be it like you know like a lazarus or something like that you know or a bunch of places you know like electronics appliances 

Recording: (7888/ 9621) 
i have done it for the last five years 

Recording: (7889/ 9621) 
yeah that could really bite you in the back though winning all that money i would be quite content with $1 million but $10 million is kind of like an overkill i mean do you think anybody in this town has $10 million well maybe a couple of people yeah 

Recording: (7890/ 9621) 
like why she pitched you know be happy for the indians unlike i am happy for that is fine 

Recording: (7891/ 9621) 
but having done it before you know and knowing where i went wrong you know that would not happen again so i have been off that shit for a while but again that was back in the actually it was in the 90s early 90s but you know i was been doing it when we were it was a recreation type of thing you know not as a daily you know somebody come knocking on the door oh yeah okay oh yeah oh yeah yeah stupid but i would like to do something like that then i would not mind having some kind of place for you know you see a lot of different downandout type people and everything and really nobody really trying to help them or nothing you know i would like to think that maybe even this thing you know could be like a sanctuary for me to come in and get some peace of mind or something mmhmm 

Recording: (7892/ 9621) 
do you think there are things that can be aware of it and you can put slacks on girls and not leave it up to them to choose the height of their skirts and they have got stairs up and down and they get in their lockers and they bend over and that is just too much i mean i think that is the first thing that has to be done take away that that should not even be a thought and it is distracting enough for the guys their own age but then you put these young teachers in there maybe they are single guys that just had a hell of a time in college and then they get around all these girls and oh my gosh well you know you got to look at that you got to be more aware 

Recording: (7893/ 9621) 
sad stories let is see i do not know that is basically who i am 

Recording: (7894/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7895/ 9621) 
i 

Recording: (7896/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7897/ 9621) 
she does not so much mind anymore i mean since i have turned 18 i mean ever since then it is been no problem or anything i mean she is sort of let me have my own opinion 

Recording: (7898/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7899/ 9621) 
right personally i think it is a good idea i mean i i mean to me you know it seems only logical that you would only have the amount of children that you can support you know and that but i come from a completely different background and everything else and education than than most of probably the people that this would concern but i do think i do not know i mean with the birth control that is available and all the options that there are sometimes i find it hard to be sympathetic for these people who just have so many children that they can not feed they can not take care of i mean it is not like it was way back when when there was nothing and you were just stuck this way i mean a woman can you know protect herself if you know the man is not willing to do it or whatever so and adoption and all the other things 

Recording: (7900/ 9621) 
mhm 

Recording: (7901/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (7902/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7903/ 9621) 
ha ha ha ha 

Recording: (7904/ 9621) 
control problems of course there is always a leak somewhere yeah well it could be hot water they send out heating hot water to all the different buildings from the power plant but about now they drain that it is drained for the summer to give us an opportunity to work on leaks and stuff so they might of the door and going back i this what they were going for and the majority of the people in the skilled trades are not real big participators in the union you know we just ride along and from what i have seen over the 20 years i have been here is it seemed that a lot of the union what they did was keep the troublemaker employees around longer you know and so we have really now got a lot of the union what they did was was keep the troublemaker employees around longer you know and so we have really never had a lot of use for the union but recently we just figured out that you know if they decide to strike we have no choice too and you can not work because they will take all the money you make crossing that line so you cannot work anybody that came back to work will lose all the money that they made they will take them to court and yeah it is against take 

Recording: (7905/ 9621) 
um they like me but then they do not like me 

Recording: (7906/ 9621) 
it is a good place they even stopped playing the ghetto music they have this jukebox and it was horrible they played the same three songs with horribly offensive lyrics and no melody whatsoever 

Recording: (7907/ 9621) 
i do not think so 

Recording: (7908/ 9621) 
now 

Recording: (7909/ 9621) 
i wish i would these guys going to military school and so forth you know they have had problems before somewhere along the line whether it is academics or social are you ready to take on this additional responsibility no but we do not promote it again we get a separate rule we have academics for the university oh you are going to be a sport athlete oh then we got a different standard here i am sure they do they have different standards for a student athlete as opposed to what your standards were coming into college i am presuming you were not an athlete 

Recording: (7910/ 9621) 
there might be 

Recording: (7911/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7912/ 9621) 
i am just kidding 

Recording: (7913/ 9621) 
and now it is vegas 

Recording: (7914/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7915/ 9621) 
which is well yeah you know could have done that too 

Recording: (7916/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7917/ 9621) 
wonderful restaurants 

Recording: (7918/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7919/ 9621) 
i have never heard of it being developed commercially 

Recording: (7920/ 9621) 
and god only knows he would get a half a dozen drinks in him then he would go around the house testing testing say a few words for a pot and we used to say get him out of here you know 

Recording: (7921/ 9621) 
yeah just in their corporate offices and that would be fun so eventually i will have my own radio station if they interviewed me and knew that they would be like quick get that girl out of here no but that is like the most exciting thing right now is that i mean that looks real promising and if i do that then i am going to have to do something voluntary or some voluntary work or choices i looked at that too that is choices for domestic violence that is an organization that i think would be really interesting and help me feel like you know helping people they give new direction for abused wives and mothers and help them get on their feet you know give them the access to the different organizations that are out there basically hide them until they can get on their own because if they are abused the husbands are like you know a nightmare out there so things like that 

Recording: (7922/ 9621) 
i had my head was that far below the surface 

Recording: (7923/ 9621) 
right right it probably went out of business when he left 

Recording: (7924/ 9621) 
that is cool 

Recording: (7925/ 9621) 
so she would have been going to northland high school which is up here just up where i am living 161 cleveland area so it would have been interesting but then the other side of it women tend to have the more emotional type of feelings than men you know we carried on our shoulders you know so i just hope see just 

Recording: (7926/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7927/ 9621) 
well we were in vancouver so it is not that far away we did not hear about it for a couple of days but i heard that that is all that was on every aspect of his life every aspect of the search do people really need to know that do they need to have a driven home and i think at that point that is where the media they are sensationalizing it 

Recording: (7928/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7929/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7930/ 9621)

Recording: (7945/ 9621) 
to let her out and that is kind of like i mean of course a kid you can not put in a yard 

Recording: (7946/ 9621) 
oh no no they move you around all the time when you teach kids with learning disabilities they move you to where the population is rather than move the kids to you so yeah i have been in columbus and worthington are the two systems i have been in but in those systems they can move you around from school to school i am in the same one now for this is my seventh year at the middle school 

Recording: (7947/ 9621) 
that is cool 

Recording: (7948/ 9621)

yeah 

Recording: (7951/ 9621)

they were the majority huh 

Recording: (7974/ 9621) 
and was a wannabe writer i mean her mother was she wrote quite a number of poems and paid to have them published in a small booklet and some of them were real good and some of them and my wife wrote some poetry too she would be down there typing and she would she always had these spiral notebooks and she would stop and get an idea for a poem maybe from something she was working on i do not know what but anyway she wrote quite a few poems some of them real good poetry i thought most of them of more or less a religious nature and moral nature in fact the desk that she had we finished off part of her basement she had her office down there and her desk is still down there and one of the typewriters that she used but it is i do not know it is been disused for too long i guess because i have tried to type on it it does not shift like it should and so on but anyway she had i do not know how many of these spiral notebooks around and she would just write in them and since she passed away in 1979 i have run across well i just i finally decided well those notebooks are down there and if i need one for something i will just go ahead and use it and i have run across a couple of her poems that i did not know anything about 

Recording: (7975/ 9621) 
there would been a small raised place out there and what i remember about it is one morning dad went out to milk and the milk cows were out on that island 

Recording: (7976/ 9621) 
i got one buddy that meets all the criteria there and everything and i see him quite a bit on the street and everything you know and he just he begs me to take him and get him help and everything but you know i keep saying you know you are the one that is got to help yourself man you know you got to give it up the war is over you know and he is like 53 and i see him down here every now and then you know so but you know he just drinks all the time to try to ease the pain and the pain really should have been done and gone by as much as he drank in his life you know so i think there is a lot of people that can use that as an excuse you know 

Recording: (7977/ 9621)

Recording: (7985/ 9621)

all focus changes it really does 

Recording: (7997/ 9621) 
well they knew all different things i mean culturally you know it was different music of course i am in a suburban high school in cincinnati you did not get exposed to much so that was the biggest thing well of course they talk funny in the east but you know other than that other than the culture shock it was not that different

Recording: (8043/ 9621) 
i am not sure where my father would have been and my father was very liberal more so even than my mother because if it is not something that is part of your culture every day and you have been told it is wrong and the catholic church said it was wrong as most religions do i am sure he would have had some concern but i think his intellect would eventually have worked it out especially if he sat down and talked with him and he would not have done you know there would not have been any gay bashing with him there would not have been you know what happened you know to the black man in jasper texas and the you know the shepherd boy in what was that oklahoma he would not have 

Recording: (8044/ 9621)

Recording: (8049/ 9621) 
no he does not have anything he will not talk to me yet 

Recording: (8050/ 9621) 
and they always what made me mad about it is because everyone always thinks you are mad at them 

Recording: (8051/ 9621) 
but she is out there somewhere we do not have clear evidence where she is there were a couple of times where we thought we knew where samantha was when there were all those clones of her i think that was in the second season or so i think if they were going to end it they were going to have to have like three episodes in a row that just were tying up all these loose ends that they keep having i suspect they probably will not do that they will leave things openended for future tv movies or maybe another featurelength movie 

Recording: (8052/ 9621) 
when i was teaching it that was kind of before all the moms went to work

this poor 

Recording: (8059/ 9621) 
no i 

Recording: (8060/ 9621) 
it was well it started out as computer science under the college of arts and sciences but then there was this whole foreign language requirement and a bad incident with a counselor and eventually i became a proud member of the college of business 

Recording: (8061/ 9621) 
yeah and i am like oh this is really interesting you know and then i will drive along and people are just like ah blowing the horns and i am like well i could care less 

Recording: (8062/ 9621) 
i see it as a problem and if i were african american i would not like to see it simply because it is a child not being brought up in his tradition but on the other hand i hate to see a child left in foster care or in an orphanage when he could have a home and i think parents who are willing to adopt a black child or a mixed race child or an asian child or any are gonna be sensitive to cultural things because we are just it is just the way things are slanted these days i mean diversity diversity is an issue and people who are willing to venture out into mixedrace adoption would already be way hipster 

Recording: (8063/ 9621) 
yeah well the first time i went officially with the exchange program the second time i just went and the exchange program happened to be there at the same time but i did not go like under their insurance or on the same flight as them i just kind of met up with them

Recording: (8070/ 9621) 
i was not really living i was actually serving a mission for my church 

Recording: (8071/ 9621) 
i think i did not know the difference so it did not affect me at all it is just they are just another person i think more as i am being exposed to patients with the different lifestyles and knowing how to educate their caregivers and what they need i felt somewhat illequipped the first few times but knowing what the expectations are especially like with spinal cord injury patients and when you go into sexuality and teaching them after injury i mean as a nurse you need to be able to educate them i felt pretty 

Recording: (8072/ 9621) 
and you screwed something up 

Recording: (8073/ 9621) 
we just started reselling 

Recording: (8074/ 9621)

Recording: (8080/ 9621) 
you know like when i worked in westerville i had bought my house because i used to work off of east north broadway and the freeway and i thought i was going to be there forever

Recording: (8085/ 9621) 
yeah yeah there can not be sanctions for doing the right thing and so i am opposed to that well yeah i guess you would have to say that i would be opposed to arresting mothers for anything in that relation that the effort should focus on getting them to stop but not forcing them to stop whatever it is they are doing

so i mean that is what i am saying i think it is even the american disabilities act talks about certain things about employers and with my lawsuit with the chill and with all the public trials of high profile trials i think it is the education for everyone to know that the legal system sucks and does not work is not fair it is a rich man is person or a rich person is system judges are bought and paid for they are elected there is a lot of crap there and i learned all this not from just my experience but from people that i know that are attorneys that there are judges down there that take bribes and that is not right so you can not when you are dealing with that system justice comes at a price and you get as much justice as you can afford and during my lawsuit that was very evident you know laws are made to protect people that are wealthy and that commit crimes and it is not right it is not fair but that is the way it is so i did not want to go into law did not want to go into paralegal i was looking into that and lady kept pounding me and telling me you know maybe you could get in it to make a difference i am like why would i want to make a difference if it kills me you know because i know myself and i do not put up with crap i see a liar i bring him out i was just brought up to be an honest person unfortunately there is a lot of people out there that they sell out their ideals and their principles for $40000 a year then they use their family or their situation financially excuse to sell those ideals out i am not that kind of person and i will not ever be so if that means that i stay monetarily poor for the rest of my life then so be it i got a conscience and people that are honest and have a conscience are dangerous out there but that is basically where i have been i have lived here my whole life like i said i went to college i played baseball due to injuries knees and shoulder i was procaliber i played baseball with paul oneal and kent merker which are a couple of guys that you know did get signed professionally and are playing right now so at least i can say i played against him and at least with kent merker i can say i hit a home run off of him so that was a while ago but it was when he was young and very good and i was still can you tell me a little bit about what happened to michelle and about your lawsuit i do not follow that way anymore i follow a more natural way of following god nothing new age i do not want to say exactly what i am just saying that the people of this this land long time ago before anybody came over here with their bibles and crap raymond jesus down in peoples third the people of this land had a way of worshiping god and that is the way i want to that is the way i follow so a lot of people say that is native american or say that is indian or whatever you you know i do not care what they want to put on it but it is it is it is a natural way of following god is the way i put it you know worshipping that and respecting the spirit that moves through all things all living things and so i went through all that and all those changes and are you know coping with them and trying to find ways to cope with them too 

Recording: (8100/ 9621) 
too much 

Recording: (8101/ 9621) 
said to me that can not be wrong because the computer said that was a word i said that is a word come with me i will show you what a vestibule is 

Recording: (8102/ 9621) 
he is 

Recording: (8103/ 9621) 
i know i know well it is good to have that i think it would be good to have that leeway but i am not sure i would trust myself because there were definitely times when i was teaching when i would have more of an affinity towards certain students and less towards others and i wanted to be fair in terms of not cutting down the ones that i did not like that much yeah yeah 

Recording: (8104/ 9621) 
you do 

Recording: (8105/ 9621) 
and i really feel like if you are going to run for president of the united states you ought to be smart 

Recording: (8106/ 9621) 
there is yeah 

Recording: (8107/ 9621) 
no that is one thing that i found was really lacking here for my son 

Recording: (8108/ 9621) 
mmhmm sure 

Recording: (8109/ 9621) 
he is really just yeah he does not think through the implications of things real well in his personal life 

Recording: (8110/ 9621) 
i mean obviously being a little boy i remember seeing things like football or whatever you would see something you thought it was neat so you would do it or whatever 

Recording: (8111/ 9621) 
helps the curve 

Recording: (8112/ 9621) 
yeah it says 

Recording: (8113/ 9621) 
was working out there 

Recording: (8114/ 9621) 
i wish they could 

Recording: (8115/ 9621) 
mhm 

Recording: (8116/ 9621) 
well yeah it is kind of like making your mouth water when you see food 

Recording: (8117/ 9621) 
columbus needs that as much as people do not want other things to close i just feel we have to keep we have to grow those people have to travel so far to shop and you know i do not think that is really fair to them 

Recording: (8118/ 9621) 
to me that was very strange 

Recording: (8119/ 9621) 
oh she is cute she really is really cute i mean i mean she is got big eyes and big fluffy cheeks 

Recording: (8120/ 9621) 
it is always going to be somebody that can complain about something well that is another thing where you have to take the individuality into account because not everybody likes to cook you know everybody most people know how to open a can of soup or something and boil water make some toast but you know that is about all that they want to do as far as it comes to cooking even if they do have to cook for their family not everybody not every female likes to cook you know they just do it because you know they are supposed to or whatever and i know some families where the men the husband does all of the grocery shopping and all of the cooking and the wife does you know whatever she does i mean it is individuality again so 

Recording: (8121/ 9621) 
okay so people can like fly in do their little wedding thing fly out 

Recording: (8122/ 9621) 
yeah it is weird this microphone is a little bit different 

Recording: (8123/ 9621) 
that does not so much bother me it is just having it forced on me like i said it just sort of gives me a different opinion of it 

Recording: (8124/ 9621) 
you even got these what stunt guns they are the ones that scare me 

Recording: (8125/ 9621) 
yeah jason and i went together 

Recording: (8126/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (8127/ 9621) 
see there again the business outfoxed the consumer basically you need to do less consumption and buying material goods and sharing your time with one another try to understand your neighbor more and spending time getting quality time for understanding the intangibles of life the tangibles depreciate and they will depreciate and will be nothing and your investment is gone 

Recording: (8128/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (8129/ 9621) 
well that used to be where all the teenagers went 

Recording: (8130/ 9621) 
yeah exactly 

Recording: (8131/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8132/ 9621) 
i mean i feel i lean toward no i do not have a problem actually i saw something on the news the other night about they were offering crack mothers money for sterilization and there was a big debate about that but again the argument there on the human rights side was that if they are you know on cocaine or whatever they can not make the sound decision to be sterilized but at the same time like can they make the sound decision to have children 

Recording: (8133/ 9621) 
because he well i have had five babies you know i really have to work when you talked about that the older you get i have to work really really hard to stay in halfway decent shape

mbc 뉴스 김재경입니다 

Recording: (8136/ 9621) 
no i mean the money you know the money is great you know fine it is the biggest raise i have ever given anybody here at the university and actually the deal that they offered the sunday before they went on on strike was a better deal than what they have really settled for now as far as because the signing bonus was more and the big stipulation was the fact that these people did not want to be separated from the hospital they do not think it is fair you know that you start down at the hospital as a janitor or whatever and you make this amount and if you came to main campus you would make 75 cents more an hour automatic and then they did the raise and they wanted 80 cents at the hospital and a dollar on main campus and stuff so that is kind of a sticky situation because they have always kept the university and the hospital separate budget they are definitely a separate budget the hospital i can see where they are coming from everybody in the hospital business is struggling right now with the insurance problems and this and that and they are 35 million in the hole because they bought osu east and all this you know it is not the union is fault that they ran out the contract you know and you know so and what we find in our area mainly is that people the entrance wage is so low that it is hard to find anybody that has any skills to come in and do the jobs that is you know and they want this place to be the top ten in the nation or whatever but they are not willing to pay a lot of these people they think contracting is the way but you are always going to have to have people here because contractors just do not drop what they are doing and show up today and a lot of times we have a job finished before they have written up the work order 

Recording: (8137/ 9621) 
well when you have formulas to make bombs and you know 

Recording: (8138/ 9621) 
mmhmm it is at the same building actually it is said it is used for different things 

Recording: (8139/ 9621) 
yeah i was only 19 well i was 18 when i went in but 

Recording: (8140/ 9621) 
exactly but i do there is the other side with native americans too it is you know our children are being taken away from us well not exactly you are giving up your children and something has to be done but there is also that i mean i think it is probably a legitimate fear that children of that group are to be homogenized out of their heritage but i do not know they are kids without parents 

Recording: (8141/ 9621) 
i mean there are gays in congress there are gays in the military as long as people do not know they do not feel threatened see and i do not understand that mindset i really do not i do not know why a man feels threatened by having a gay near them i have a couple of gay friends and one of my friends always says you know does every man like every woman he sees is he attracted to every woman you know want to go to bed with every woman you know what makes a man think that just because i am gay i might be interested in him you know that is the height of arrogance you know but men feel threatened by that just as i guess women feel threatened by lesbians i do not know but it is not a mindset i have so it is hard for me to understand 

Recording: (8142/ 9621) 
four five six seven eight nine ten just to get a volume level 

Recording: (8143/ 9621) 
okay i might want to try to adjust this a little bit again if you see it goes under let me try putting it under here i do not know if that would help yeah it is probably going to stay better 

Recording: (8144/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (8145/ 9621) 
mmmm he would absolutely have to build my trust for a long time 

Recording: (8146/ 9621)

Recording: (8154/ 9621) 
well you have an upstairs and downstairs upstairs is the tower and there is like a ground control a clearance delivery which reads all the clearances to all the airplanes and the ground control taxes them to and from the runway and the tower works everybody landing and departing or any airplane within five mile radius then once they get out of that radius downstairs which is called the approach control they work everything from there to 10000 feet and out to about 60 miles and when they get to that point then they go to the enroute centers 

Recording: (8155/ 9621) 
i have thought about that it is sad i mean that is why i have not went to college or anything because there is nothing my mind has set on that i want to do in life i just want to be rich

Recording: (8157/ 9621) 
well something that i wanted to get into some kind of counseling with people that have been through traumatic experiences but i need to be at a point where you know i am in my recovery where i know i will not be sucked back down into their way of thinking so it is a stepbystep process i tried to go into counseling for chemical addictions you know for alcohol and drugs but the bullshit excuses i kept hearing from these addicts was just too much to take and even the bullshit excuses from former addicts 

Recording: (8158/ 9621) 
cry 

Recording: (8159/ 9621) 
but my son he is so i mean i do not know if you have ever met anybody that is totally into politics 

Recording: (8160/ 9621) 
and you get the shooting out in honolulu and the next day there is another one it is just kind of like that syndrome you know well at least i can be popular for 15 minutes or whatever i mean i am not saying not to cover it but yeah and then of course you have the whole gun control stuff that is just ridiculous 

Recording: (8161/ 9621) 
if we stayed here probably 

Recording: (8162/ 9621) 
when i was a kid if a neighbor yelled at me i better make damn sure he did not tell my dad 

Recording: (8163/ 9621) 
we needed that 

Recording: (8164/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (8165/ 9621) 
yeah he says he knows vms as well but he does not like to do it so he does not do it 

Recording: (8166/ 9621) 
so there was a wadi they call it it was like a little deep oysh 

Recording: (8167/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8168/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (8169/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8170/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8171/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (8172/ 9621) 
i think that is a cop out myself 

Recording: (8173/ 9621) 
oh it was nice actually i ate a lot more healthy and it was cheaper i was getting money on my buckid so i actually got paid every day 

Recording: (8174/ 9621) 
you know imagine it and that is basically what happened to her and her mom had three kids by three different dads and they thought if they could get her out of that environment they actually had her move in with them they were her temporary foster parents and she just turned 16 so she was 15 when she moved in with them she refused to change and i do not know what could have changed it if they would have got her out earlier but basically all three of them i do not want to say are doomed but they are not even though they are out of that environment they are not doing any better 

Recording: (8175/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (8176/ 9621) 
yeah you still have to be careful 

Recording: (8177/ 9621) 
so let us say she was in a situation where she had some sort of bills to pay you know the one environment was a much more closeknit type school community than the it would not be long term and they would know that it would not be long term but that is that intangible i am saying you have somebody there because she is giving up her time not to make the high bucks but what she is bringing about is developing a character in a person to bring about the spirituality in a person that is going to carry them all through life she is also tithing more than tithing probably which i always kid with people i said the author said 10 tithing knew inflation he knew great about economics 10 is 10 and then on top of that we talk about economics a little further here the japanese so forth they save so much more than the germans and so forth and boy taking the page out of the old bible are not they we do not 

Recording: (8178/ 9621) 
yeah because it is the midwest yeah 

Recording: (8179/ 9621) 
well like i am getting ready to go through layoffs again where i work at

mbc 뉴스 김지경입니다 

Recording: (8182/ 9621) 
because that is more boring 

Recording: (8183/ 9621) 
i and you to outspoken about that so rather than banging my head on the wall to people who would not listen i just decided to leave the church i do not go there anymore the only time i have gone there was for my nephew is baptism and my grandparents funeral and that is the only time you will find me in there i went to a wedding too but it is difficult sitting in there because of the way i follow now and actually seeing things for what they are and it is frustrating not being able to explain that to people but that is okay the lawsuit we had a private investigator that went in there and found all the information that showed that they had all that higher taller glass back there over a year so they tried to use the excuse their excuse was that they could not find the hardware to install it and given all the hardware stores that we have here and the ability to overnight freight things if there was any kind of special hardware that needed to be ordered from out of state or out of the country there is no excuse so basically it came down to a legal battle which was i was not going to back down i was poor monetarily they knew that so they were using the legal system to wear me down the first at the date of filing i mean first of all it took i had a statute of limitations it was two years i had an attorney and a law firm representing me but they were dragging their feet i felt they were dragging their feet because they were in bed with the chill you know and that they were getting paid under the table to drag their feet even though i knew the guy so i just said well look i am dissatisfied i am gonna go find another attorney so give me my file see ya and i went shopping around for a new attorney it took me about seven before pardon me seven attorneys before i found one that was adequate in terms of knowledge of head injury and brain injury because his father was a neurosurgeon and he had experience and expertise in bringing up the differences and the realities of a brain injury and the effects the lifelong effects so after the two years we got in just under the two years so i mean hell that would be what it happened in 93 so just under december 95 the day the last day of the statute running out we filed so we got it filed once it was filed the judge scheduled a hearing and for whatever stupid reason the soonest they could hear the case was one year from the date that we filed so you can see when you get in to bed with you know and involved in the legal system in terms of filing a multimillion dollar lawsuit or whatever you know any kind of lawsuit the big boys get all the breaks so in my opinion the judge did not want to hear the case before then or maybe his docket was full but i am saying you know there is no prioritization in the legal system there are some things that should be addressed soon i should not have to wait that long so then it came down to one week prior to the hearing and i got a letter from my attorney and he said that that and also a phone call from the office saying that that they were filing a continuance which meant that the judge granted them an additional year of discovery whatever whatever the law says you know the judge says he has to back it up but so i postponed the trial for another year which pissed me off you know but that is exactly what they were planning on you know wearing me down like i said knowing that i do not have the money to throw in there and say hey you know um but they know full well that we had all the evidence that we had to sell uh that just postponed it for another year finally we got into uh coming in and then they uh sent a letter saying they wanted to meet for arbitration to see if we could hammer out some kind of settlement a couple months before the trial i was unaware of this common practice but it was a very iffy situation juries here in columbus have been ultra conservative they feel that people for some reason or another that people that have been legitimately injured in their lives have been affected that they do not deserve money for whatever reason and i do not think it is fair that they can sit back and be that conservative if it has not happened to them i do not think that is fair because it does affect your entire life it has otherwise i would be fulltime employed i would be gainfully employed and making money and i am not and that is not because of anything it is by choices on my part but it is you know there is a lot there the betrayal that i have had to struggle with there is a lot there that you know i feel i have been betrayed by everybody that taught me i feel betrayed by the government by the legal system by the politicians by all the people that have been put in charge to protect people to protect ideals to protect principles throw it out the window for money and then when it comes down to me being legitimately hurt it got down to just dollars and cents bartering for what my life was worth and it is the bidding started at $125000 now i feel i am worth more than that i feel you can not put a value on a human life there were just subtle things that my sense of taste and smell was gone for about a year and a half just all the trauma that goes along with it not just the physical trauma i mean that was enough to kill anybody but because of me because of my size because of my strength i was not killed you know so the physical burden still remains i was and is worse having to have a lack of money now means lack of socializing means lack of going and doing things do not have a lot of relationships do not have a girlfriend do not have a wife nothing like that i have got a dog a golden retriever 

Recording: (8184/ 9621)

right 

Recording: (8192/ 9621) 
right and i am sure it will especially when you already recognize that you know if you already know in advance what kinds of things you are going to be helping along it is a lot easier than trying to figure out what is going on here you know 

Recording: (8193/ 9621) 
and where my mom was a young high school student just graduating from high school and so they got together there moved to california

mmhmm 

Recording: (8207/ 9621) 
yeah like they all get the option but i understand very few exercise it so you know if they were to not give them the tuition that they could that most of them are not using and then give them the $2 an hour you know but then that could then you could say that osu is helping to keep people down and so you have to still it is an odd balance there it is and like something like that does not seem too skilled to me me so i do not really know why there is much of a union for that but obviously there 

Recording: (8208/ 9621) 
i think that is really a major problem and i think there is a lot of problem with young kids today do it my way or they all hit them or 

Recording: (8209/ 9621) 
with my kid 

Recording: (8210/ 9621)

Recording: (8216/ 9621) 
yeah exactly it is a very conservative town 

Recording: (8217/ 9621) 
that would be great but what i was most worried about was all the equipment and stuff that was in the truck i mean there is a 2000 pound forklift back there and you are not gonna just dodge that 

Recording: (8218/ 9621) 
yeah it is so much better than having an alley or sitting there on your deck and looking your house the neighbors right behind you you are staring at them sitting on their deck we got all woods and a creek and then the golf course so that is hard to find in the city limits because we are inside 270 still so 

Recording: (8219/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (8220/ 9621) 
it depends on what area you live in too the area where i live in you get little house because you are close to everything whereas you get kind of farther away from the center of the area you can get a bigger house there is some really really pretty ones 

Recording: (8221/ 9621) 
it is just like a miniature version of ohio state 

Recording: (8222/ 9621) 
come to offer me that or tell i mean she is the first i never even heard of it and there is all kinds of programs that you know like there is this one that where like say i live with my mom my mom can be getting paid from the government for me to be living there you know because she kind of helps me out you know and i do not know what that was called i mean i am just now finding this stuff out you know it is like i guess i can apply for welfare in that 

Recording: (8223/ 9621) 
and i did a lot of music interviewing and writing there and then i moved up to editor and it was sort of through that job that i got my first job with sony while i was as a sort of ohio representative so i was concentrated in ohio state and then you know basically it is just something i am not doing this as a career it is just sort of something i am doing in the meantime till i decide whether i am going back to school or

Recording: (8228/ 9621) 
i think it is good and i think women are capable of doing that my only disagreement with it is that i would have a real problem being in that boxhole and have a woman beside me if she gets shot i do not know how i could deal with that men i do not know women have different feelings about each other than they do with men and men have different feelings about each other than they do with women and everything and they tend to be more protective

hmm 

Recording: (8321/ 9621) 
i think my mother was okay with it all the conversations we had about it since then lead me to believe yes this did not traumatize her i think it was kind of a nobrainer for her as well she is like ah yeah all your friends and your dad or a large new experience that you do not know anything about and me talking to my mother was always a very arduous affair 

Recording: (8322/ 9621) 
not really i mean i do not think they would come to any more difficult conclusions than guys had coming up to 

Recording: (8323/ 9621) 
she will make pico overdue not like he has a lot of choice 

Recording: (8324/ 9621)

Recording: (8327/ 9621) 
now if i shoot you they might do something do not get me wrong but i mean if i shoot you they might do something but otherwise they ai not going to do nothing 

Recording: (8328/ 9621) 
of the year i mean it just got to the point where i would had enough and i did not want to go anymore 

Recording: (8329/ 9621) 
but they always say do not let the animals sleep with you and all that and with the cat they curl up with you it is hard to say no but you know what honestly eventually well it took probably a year 

Recording: (8330/ 9621) 
not badly marketing is not my strong suit i mean most of the stuff that i get is just an accident i started working for osu because another illustrator that they used who was not going to be able to do the work anymore recommended me you know that kind of thing but he was a guy 

Recording: (8331/ 9621) 
i am not gonna say it 

Recording: (8332/ 9621) 
some of the work that needs to be done 

Recording: (8333/ 9621) 
and then my oldest son is wife is a secretary in a school 

Recording: (8334/ 9621) 
so i mean he is responding 

Recording: (8335/ 9621) 
so you know what i mean i can outlast them 

Recording: (8336/ 9621) 
it is very difficult 

Recording: (8337/ 9621) 
yeah yeah something coffee donuts you know 

Recording: (8338/ 9621) 
shopping you know it but it is just become a really good metropolitan city i mean it is on its way 

Recording: (8339/ 9621) 
people to whom people were to which is crap as well so i do not do that 

Recording: (8340/ 9621) 
to is sacred it is a sacred fire so that is why it is possible but if i went down there with the laws of physics and told me that those rocks could not sustain heat yet i see when the fire keeper breaks them out of the fire pit and brings them into the sweat lodge that they are redorange glowing you are going to tell me they are not hot so that is one example 

Recording: (8341/ 9621) 
mm 

Recording: (8342/ 9621) 
and they work hard to make it easier on the students they totally restructured the place since the beginning of the year 

Recording: (8343/ 9621) 
well some of them are i guess depending on where they go but i had a kindergarten teacher tell me the other day that if a kid she only has maybe one or two kids in her whole class that has not gone to preschool or daycare and she said it takes that kid up till christmas to catch up with the things the other kids come in already knowing that is how far behind they are used to be in kindergarten you were expected to know your colors and your name and your address you did not even have to write it you just had to know how to say it and your phone number and recognize the color words and know how to sit down and take your turn and wait in line to go to the bathroom and raise your hand and social skills and that was about all they expect you to do play cooperatively that is about all they expect you to know now in kindergarten they expect you to know all of that plus by the time you get to first grade you are supposed to have all the numbers you used to from one to thirty it used to be if you could say them in order and recognize them you did not even have to know how to spell the word or write them down now they want you to know the numbers one through a hundred you are supposed to have twenty sight words by the time you go to first grade 

Recording: (8344/ 9621) 
i think he needs counseling at that point 

Recording: (8345/ 9621) 
yeah that is the way that is the way you really should be i mean you got to be ready for tournament time you know 

Recording: (8346/ 9621) 
for me personally family being close both sides of the family are here for me familiarity i do not like a lot of change a lot of new things for me i was involved in i swam for osu swimming and got real involved with the osu sports and just the sporting programs and i love ohio state football so i like the sports there are a lot of activities to do too now with my little boy going to kosai and the zoo and just knowing where things are and how to get around 

Recording: (8347/ 9621) 
so in one way it is kind of a blessing 

Recording: (8348/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8349/ 9621) 
i had three months and then it got postponed then i got postponed again and i was like this is stupid in exchange for postponing it again my rationale was fine i will give myself another 10 days 

Recording: (8350/ 9621)

Recording: (8351/ 9621)

Recording: (8352/ 9621) 
i think so 

Recording: (8353/ 9621)

Recording: (8355/ 9621)

Recording: (8357/ 9621) 
either roleplaying games 

Recording: (8358/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8359/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (8360/ 9621) 
yeah i do not understand it i really have a hard time understanding you know they are not after you they just want to live a life 

Recording: (8361/ 9621) 
flowers and 

Recording: (8362/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (8363/ 9621) 
oh yeah almost always does not matter what the disability is and i do not know why this is but they used to say eight to one now they are saying more like five to one does not matter if it is a speech impediment blindness retardation cerebral palsy deafness learning disability you name it there is five to one more boys than there are girls and we do not know why 

Recording: (8364/ 9621) 
four or five 

Recording: (8365/ 9621) 
well at the time they were having a lot of trouble at the school and they just wanted to get rid of some people 

Recording: (8366/ 9621) 
i am waiting for it i do not know what i am going to do but i am waiting for it 

Recording: (8367/ 9621) 
yet they pray a prayer every sunday and we believe in the seen and unseen i will never forget it because i recited it for god knows how many years but when you talk to them about possession when you talk to them about demons or spirits they freak out 

Recording: (8368/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8369/ 9621) 
but yeah it is a cool head on her shoulder she would not let that happen unless she told me about it she would probably be afraid to tell me that i would catch an airplane flight down over there or something you know hook the guy up or something 

Recording: (8370/ 9621) 
i am not actually sure 

Recording: (8371/ 9621) 
they said for a health reason you would have to eat meat there is no way someone could tell me that i would have to eat meat 

Recording: (8372/ 9621) 
yeah it was a homemade bow and arrow 

Recording: (8373/ 9621) 
our school was not really a violent one there were not really any fights or anything 

Recording: (8374/ 9621) 
and so i think it gets driven home i think the media does that in a lot of places they pick something that is sensational and they are making it even more sensational like when john kennedy died 

Recording: (8375/ 9621) 
waterberry 

Recording: (8376/ 9621) 
yeah now if you the thing to do is if you know the call sign 

Recording: (8377/ 9621) 
and then on out and the enemy was over there well they put us in the front of that mountain right down there 

Recording: (8378/ 9621) 
his dad is a graduate of stanford but he is they never leave there i mean that is an excellent medical school and everything but those football players they are smart they do not quit you know i mean it is amazing they never do 

Recording: (8379/ 9621) 
a lot of good investments a lot of saving a lot of living well below means and owning six businesses yeah his definition of retired is basically he does not have to work he does but he does not have to he just finished up a temp job up at quest i think he gets paid like $375 an hour now 

Recording: (8380/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (8381/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8382/ 9621) 
have you ever met somebody like that 

Recording: (8383/ 9621) 
well it is well let us put it this way i can go out and make money without even making money off of government agencies if i wanted to if i wanted to be a crook i could be a crook and i could have people rent me a house low income i could move in there 

Recording: (8384/ 9621) 
tv about and everything that stuff is been going on for years 

Recording: (8385/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (8386/ 9621) 
uh so uh who christian and i uh spent the rest of the evening calling people uh i got in my head i did not want anybody to call and say how you get it and so the best way to do with that situation to call globally cross the board plus it was a fun psychological experiment just as as they go how can you get to tell people that is good that is good himself morning so i am like hi how you doing no i have not talked to you in a little while is everything okay actually no my father killed himself this morning you are kidding so you end up after a dozen or so people narrowing it down you are kidding you are not serious no 

Recording: (8387/ 9621) 
just from doing that but when you have a dog why bother and they will not allow dogs so she is not allowed to go over there so she is always like but it does make a big difference so i guess that is what i am saying for them 

Recording: (8388/ 9621) 
yeah that is the bureaucracy it would be too much of a struggle i think 

Recording: (8389/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (8390/ 9621) 
you know so they offered to send me to med school here 

Recording: (8391/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8392/ 9621) 
it is the article 

Recording: (8393/ 9621) 
on 

Recording: (8394/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (8395/ 9621) 
i have heard some of them talk about it 

Recording: (8396/ 9621) 
so i do not know maybe it is a little bit more dangerous but i think that comes with a bigger city when you get more people there is obviously going to be some more problems and i mean that is really all that i noticed it is obviously a lot more buildup it is gotten a lot more commercial things like city center 

Recording: (8397/ 9621) 
that makes sense and a lot of the new ballparks are made smaller so they can hit home runs because that attracts fans people go nuts people would rather see a tight game that was like 7 to like 6 rather than watch like a 2 to 1 ball game 

Recording: (8398/ 9621) 
real positive about it but basically i lived here for my whole life and i grew up on campus 

Recording: (8399/ 9621) 
i thought it was 43 

Recording: (8400/ 9621) 
you puke up 

Recording: (8401/ 9621) 
everybody lives on a farm 

Recording: (8402/ 9621) 
oh he is dead 

Recording: (8403/ 9621) 
and of course bill moulton was the greatest i mean have you seen his cartoons 

Recording: (8404/ 9621) 
throw nerf balls in the audience 

Recording: (8405/ 9621) 
as to what the sanctuary should be like so we had a tour the choir took a tour our choir director arranged it to about five or six churches in the columbus area to sing in them and not for an audience but just to sing and to see which ones we liked the acoustics of and that was interesting we sang in central presbyterian church downtown which is where one of my orchestras plays a lot and we sang in other different kinds of churches and said what we liked about and what we did not maybe it had some feedback i think the new building is acoustically very good it is certainly much better than old worship center because i do not know if you have seen a picture or anything of the church but the old worship center was designed by a modern architect to be a modern quoteunquote type building in 1962 and it is yeah it it is flat there is a flat roof with a clear story in the middle it has nothing in it it is just empty space over the worship center so when you would sing in that as a choir you spread out along the front if you were under the high place your voice would go all the way to the back but if you were under this flat ceiling that is only about nine or 10 feet high it was dead it was just muffled and it was terrible acoustically but we made do with it for many years and then we had the chance to get this input into this new building and it is it is a it is really beautiful it is a circular almost circular big space with a high point in the middle of the roof and it is it is nice well you could still go it is they will not have they will not have a lot of 

Recording: (8406/ 9621) 
so yeah those places were probably about 30 years old you know fire hazards insulation just you know fire hazard everywhere 

Recording: (8407/ 9621) 
i know i have done studies and i took some of those classes and you just think about it that way the nurse said something like you take everything for a fact and i thought that was strange but i think there are a lot of things that are probably positive enough about it that i would want to do it for a while as long as i could 

Recording: (8408/ 9621) 
well well yeah well librarians traditionally have problems with it is like a form of censorship you know big brother things librarians have always had problems with that i do not know it is hard to balance it if somebody is out there actually doing criminal work criminal activity and causing damage you want to know about it but how do you do that and still protect the rights of everybody else i do not know how to balance it 

Recording: (8409/ 9621) 
as far as my brother goes i can not say i really see my brother too often he does live in town but usually he is either at work because he works full time then he is a parttime student at columbus state so i do not really see him during the day and then at night he usually goes out and does his thing i go out and do my thing so as far as what is going on with him i really do not know but i know i mean there is nothing real serious going on with him or anything like that 

Recording: (8410/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8411/ 9621) 
like here i have been told you know they have been here for a while then there was not any parties here for a little while and then i have been the ones in cleveland since he dayton akron detroit new york pittsburgh philadelphia 

Recording: (8412/ 9621)

Recording: (8413/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8414/ 9621) 
i mean the fact of the matter is a lot of people out there i guess could be child molesters or whatever i mean it does not matter if they are straight or gay or whatever the fact of the matter is i mean they are out there 

Recording: (8415/ 9621) 
i know steve my husband sometimes i mean we have taken joey out to the cemetery a few times to go to the grave site of his mother and he says you know very often boy she would really like to have been here and done things with him 

Recording: (8416/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8417/ 9621) 
you know which when you should is a better way of putting it 

Recording: (8418/ 9621) 
네 

Recording: (8419/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (8420/ 9621) 
tradition 

Recording: (8421/ 9621) 
uh huh 

Recording: (8422/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (8423/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (8424/ 9621) 
oh right 

Recording: (8425/ 9621) 
see what kind of things you are ordering where your hits are on the internet 

Recording: (8426/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8427/ 9621) 
see i would be all up in the room too looking reading i would be just like my mother was even though i hated it but i would do that 

Recording: (8428/ 9621) 
yeah so that worked out so i really had not dated for a long time and then i started dating again and what is weird is you almost go right back in to the patterns because you are so scared you are going to be alone you see yourself going i can be with this person and you know in your head this person is not for you and then luckily indirectly i met my husband 

Recording: (8429/ 9621) 
you probably see it better now not that photo not that one but yeah it is just certain things make person themselves 

Recording: (8430/ 9621) 
and i said you know i do not know why you are insecure i said everything you do you do well i said i try things and just bomb at them and i said you just zip through them and i said maybe someday when you are older you will look back and go oh i see what dad was talking about but she just can not see that 

Recording: (8431/ 9621) 
if you are determined to having too much stress by your doctor then the government will pay for a vacation for you 

Recording: (8432/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (8433/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (8434/ 9621) 
oh really 

Recording: (8435/ 9621) 
just the number of people that were here 

Recording: (8436/ 9621) 
yes but that is great though 

Recording: (8437/ 9621) 
i mean there is nothing bad about them or anything that they 

Recording: (8438/ 9621) 
well see he moved into an apartment over on 11th avenue 

Recording: (8439/ 9621) 
that is okay i am being indiana 

Recording: (8440/ 9621) 
and i mean i know i did not think that much about it oh well i am not doing anything else why not and i mean i do not it seems kind of silly to legally have two levels i mean either you are going to do it the hard way or you are not 

Recording: (8441/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8442/ 9621) 
and these kids that are violent your whole society is violent i got okay i just got done helping my sisterinlaw that is an example right there she is got five kids she is on welfare her husband is arab right 

Recording: (8443/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8444/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (8445/ 9621) 
it is kind of like a 

Recording: (8446/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (8447/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (8448/ 9621) 
it is a lot of the it looks look and feel is a lot the same 

Recording: (8449/ 9621) 
the electric shock things 

Recording: (8450/ 9621) 
for about 17 or 18 years and just reached the point where i had enough of it and i did not want anything about it 

Recording: (8451/ 9621) 
we are in the same age right 

Recording: (8452/ 9621) 
i really did not because i felt like i was in love with these boys yeah 

Recording: (8453/ 9621) 
and the high explosive shells had 37 pounds of tnt in them so they would make quite a bang when they went off 

Recording: (8454/ 9621) 
that you really did not need because then you get more bang for your bucks 

Recording: (8455/ 9621) 
thank you 

Recording: (8456/ 9621) 
that is good no not really actually some i have and then i have run into the people that just like anything they want to get out of their hometown they do not like it they complain but normally i find that those people are not taking advantage of the you know free art shows and you know i mean the things that are free i am like oh have you done this no i did not even know about it you have lived here all your life and i have only lived here x number of years and 

Recording: (8457/ 9621) 
at each other is throat for this that and the other and you know devin is with my daughters and would not really get put in the middle of it you know and probably it was a blessing that they moved to st louis because there probably could have been more problems legal problems you know as far as going back and forth to court and putting her on a witness stand for stupid stuff you know so in hindsight it was kind of a blessing that they moved there 

Recording: (8458/ 9621) 
yeah that blocks out all that extraneous stuff that is trying to pull you away 

Recording: (8459/ 9621) 
i do not have money and when i start dating people i have extremely expensive tastes for women and i like wine and dining people i love the opera and that gets real expensive after a while it gets real expensive after a while i am taking one class i am taking an accounting class i had a real big mess academically graduated high school with a 35 it was all college prep classes ap courses i got a really high iq extremely intelligent all through high school i was just coasting on that intellect i would go in take an exam bing bang go out get an a i would not even study for it i think i studied as much my senior year as i did my freshman year for one midterm or one final and that just did not work when i got to college but i did not know that until i was done with my freshman year with a 17 gpa about let us say the middle of winter quarter i realized why i was in engineering i had applied to three colleges in my senior year of high school ohio state on a whim from my dad who told me to apply there because i could get in without any trouble whatsoever naval academy and the air force academy now naval academy air force academy and west point are three of the top ten hardest schools in the world to get into you get into one of those academies and you are coming out as an engineer that is what they all are i mean yeah there is other fields but the vast majority are engineers get in an honors engineering program called the gateway program engineering is the hardest field to study aside probably from law or medicine and i went into the honors program that was a big mistake really really big mistake i got to college and it just went downhill i had all that freedom and i had no clue how to study and it just went to hell in a handbasket summer spring quarter i switched my major to music because i am extremely musically inclined it is one of the gifts that i have gotten and that i discovered is very similar to acting which i love to do but i realized that just like acting you are all good 95 of you are poor as dirt 3 of you are right in the middle and 2 of you are extremely wealthy and the vast majority like i said 95 are dirt poor i do not want to do that my dad is a doctor i was raised in high society i do not want to leave high society i like it there i like it there a lot so i was like hey i better get out of the music thing so i decided to go into business but i can not get into business until i get a bunch of prerequisite courses out of the way because my gpa is on after this quarter i i did really good this quarter after this quarter it is up to a 22 and i am not going to be able to get into the business school until i got a bunch of prerequisites out of the way and their sequences i ca not take counting to 12 until i am done with 211 i can not take say i asked 200 and 201 until i am done with 200 and all that junk so i had to take this stupid class this summer because if i am going to get in when i want to i have to take it this summer i hate taking classes in the summer because i would rather just work and not worry about the classes and then have all sorts of fun all summer long with what my impression is that that is what i am doing this summer i am still searching for a job i would have i would have done some more searching today but i have had a few problems with my satanic computer stupid 

Recording: (8460/ 9621) 
yeah it would be just one more thing 

Recording: (8461/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8462/ 9621) 
i do not know 

Recording: (8463/ 9621) 
yeah no problem 

Recording: (8464/ 9621) 
i 

Recording: (8465/ 9621) 
i do not have a good opinion of columbus schools at all no not at all 

Recording: (8466/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8467/ 9621) 
oh it is horrible it was horrible because you watch it and you think oh my god 

Recording: (8468/ 9621) 
yeah that is what i mean they go by your age too 

Recording: (8469/ 9621) 
just because it is been three weeks now you know and not only that there is something in the deal like they lose their benefits after two weeks and the union has to pay their full wages for the work that they miss 

Recording: (8470/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8471/ 9621) 
mmhmm it is kind of frustrating but i am i it is a good it is probably good for me because i am so it is hard for me to just sit back and let other people believe whatever they want to believe you know i just want to convince them but i can not do that so it is a good exercise for me i look at it that way and just letting them go ahead and 

Recording: (8472/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8473/ 9621) 
i do not have a bloody clue to be perfectly honest with you i just noticed that it continued to decline all through high school and i was like you should get out before you actually fail the class and it was just unpleasant i think i was stupid i think that is what it amounts to not that i was not able to pick up the data i was just unwise in whether or not it was worthwhile and i believe that it is horribly worthwhile now and yet now i am not taking classes 

Recording: (8474/ 9621) 
to deal with 

Recording: (8475/ 9621) 
i mean the way i grew up is probably like back in the day like catholics against the columbus publics you know like the richies against the poories that is how i kind of see it but when i went to northland people think northland is like a rich school but the way i see it is no not really i mean we do live in a big you know housed area you know the houses are like huge is school overdosed a kid on like some i think it was a drug to calm him down so he is not so hyper and they like overdosed him like twice in a day and then when he goes home his mom is even overdosing him because they are overdosing him 

Recording: (8476/ 9621) 
and we monitor what they watch televisionwise we do a lot of library things get them to the library a couple days a week try to keep them interested in books 

Recording: (8477/ 9621) 
sure 

Recording: (8478/ 9621) 
yeah oh yeah the fiveyearold just after the whole time the minute she walks in the door you know 

Recording: (8479/ 9621) 
yeah the brady bill did not really do it for america like they thought i mean yeah you wait five days big deal go out on 20th avenue and pick one up in five minutes i have seen all kinds of people carry guns that should not 

Recording: (8480/ 9621) 
but eventually went away i just i just cause i would get stressed out and start crying and go crazy you know 

Recording: (8481/ 9621) 
hmm 

Recording: (8482/ 9621) 
and it was nice just seeing that and you could tell they were still in love and everything and you know one of them had four children one had like six you know i mean it was amazing because i thought well i bet they are not still married getting right out of high school i just was not interested in that when i was in high school at all you know i was ready to go out into the world and these girls that get married so young they just have no clue about life 

Recording: (8483/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (8484/ 9621) 
i delivered the columbus dispatch in the morning too so 

Recording: (8485/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8486/ 9621) 
he sure was 

Recording: (8487/ 9621) 
very often i mean maybe like there is like one or two that come during the year 

Recording: (8488/ 9621) 
oh yes yes 

Recording: (8489/ 9621) 
we were talking about this at work one day and i said you know i am surprised you think that way because i tend to be a little left of center on most things sometimes far left and i said now this is not she said it seems like that would be the conservative view in my opinion the conservative view is they do not want to go back to cuba not to the communists but people i have talked to even extreme conservatives and liberals they all pretty much feel the same way they are the ones i have talked i have not heard anybody 

Recording: (8490/ 9621) 
and my youngest daughter when i was cramming about because i talked to them and they said well we are coming to ohio in a couple weeks and i said oh good are you going to come and see us well no we were not planning that and i said well why well we are not driving dodie is renting us the car well all that meant was my sister was renting the car but he was driving the car i said well then how are you going to get to these other places and normally i would not do that i would just let it go well dodie is riding that car and i said well are not you driving it well yeah but and i said fine i do not even want to think about it so it is kind of like 

Recording: (8491/ 9621) 
i believe that is where it was originally set up 

Recording: (8492/ 9621) 
well i am not the mayor or anything so i am not gonna make any promises 

Recording: (8493/ 9621) 
am i gonna vote for 

Recording: (8494/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8495/ 9621) 
he is like this robot 

Recording: (8496/ 9621) 
yeah i am at the end of it all 

Recording: (8497/ 9621) 
but then it is like some evil person back there in the screening room puts some of this junk in there right in the middle and then you go you can not stop and not watch that you know and if i was in charge of it i would cut some of it out it is not that important 

Recording: (8498/ 9621) 
oh probably my family my kids are here i have a grandchild now so yeah i like to stay close to all them 

Recording: (8499/ 9621) 
why do not you do that for a year and not do it for a year just go down for the day and then come back to upper arlington at night and live how do you like to do that 

Recording: (8500/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8501/ 9621) 
very slow very methodical we take them to dog my husband is taken them many times for when they had to have cataract operations you know so he is involved with the girls too 

Recording: (8502/ 9621) 
i do not know that is so controversial i mean i mean to the point i mean they show them how to put condoms on bananas in public schools and it is like well are you promoting sex then or should do i 

Recording: (8503/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (8504/ 9621) 
well like i am a philosophy minor so if you look at different ethical theories and stuff there is a hierarchy kind of this is what i have found there is a hierarchy of things that are like the inalienable rights for instance if you come into my house and rob me and then run outside to kill you my property like there is a hierarchy there for stealing another life that is why people say oh you can do it so but i really feel like there is nothing like if it is inalienable the definition is it is not able to be taken not even by yourself that is why you can not commit suicide and since it is the highest thing because without it you can not even do the other so it naturally has to be higher ordered than the others because without that you can not commit suicide and since it is the highest thing because without it you can not even do the other so it naturally has to be higher ordered than the others because without that you can not do the you can not be ethical in any other way so that has to be the highest thing and if it is inalienable because i did not give it to you i can not take it back you never forfeited that you never gave me that right so that is why i feel like i could never want that to kill another person 

Recording: (8505/ 9621) 
but it kind of helps actually because you have all the people in there who are not honors and they do not know how to like the partiers they do not know how to study or anything 

Recording: (8506/ 9621) 
oh i see 

Recording: (8507/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (8508/ 9621) 
i have a friend in new jersey or two friends a married couple she is a lifelong democrat he is been a lifelong republican and there is always interesting discussions when i go to visit and i went to visit them a few weeks before clinton was formally impeached last year and i just decided i was not going to bring it up 

Recording: (8509/ 9621) 
only with her those students who are high achievers who are very bright talented maybe truly gifted who are willing to jump through the hoops 

Recording: (8510/ 9621) 
right right 

Recording: (8511/ 9621) 
right in there 

Recording: (8512/ 9621) 
it is not monroe county is it monroe okay okay 

Recording: (8513/ 9621) 
i do not think they should make people pray if they do not want to before class or anything like that but as far as morals and the right thing to do in life and what is out there most kids know what the wrong thing is 

Recording: (8514/ 9621) 
short essay for a test but the way that i would grade those would be pretty scientific i think i would come up with a rubric and i would say you need to mention certain things and i will give certain points for your mentioning certain things yeah i have never been a teacher who is had to assign or grade creative writing i am not sure i would know how to do that yeah 

Recording: (8515/ 9621) 
she is bit 

Recording: (8516/ 9621) 
well i told him you know i said something we told you you were not to do 

Recording: (8517/ 9621) 
or just thousands is enough he did not have to have millions 

Recording: (8518/ 9621) 
mmm well that bathroom is starting to sound good right about now 

Recording: (8519/ 9621) 
town with a channel 

Recording: (8520/ 9621) 
yeah i did too man 

Recording: (8521/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8522/ 9621) 
hmm 

Recording: (8523/ 9621) 
people call up and they have no idea what they want it is like why did you do this like why did you do this to me they will call up and they will be like yeah i am thinking about getting a blanket like what do you think about those and like it is real funny when people ask me my opinion like on things like this like it is funny when people call up who are close to our age too it is funny to hear 

Recording: (8524/ 9621) 
which i she said that and i said 

Recording: (8525/ 9621) 
he is probably been married for four or five years 

Recording: (8526/ 9621) 
yeah most of them 

Recording: (8527/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8528/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (8529/ 9621) 
oh what does it mean well instead of going to your classroom you go into a room where you sit and the teacher gives you all your work for the day and you can not talk or anything 

Recording: (8530/ 9621) 
i am guessing 

Recording: (8531/ 9621) 
i had somebody call and they were doing a survey and they wanted to know what i did for a living and i told them i said well we are done 

Recording: (8532/ 9621) 
just because you sin does not mean you are going to hell 

Recording: (8533/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8534/ 9621) 
and just because you are i mean i was not really an athletic i did play sports when i was in high school but i would dance or was not any good you know just like other guys but whether i did or whether i did not you know i do not i do not nobody picked on me i mean one time i got into it with one of the centers in football you know a big old guy and i was still about the same size but 

Recording: (8535/ 9621) 
yeah yeah i am not married i am single 

Recording: (8536/ 9621) 
yeah exactly i know 

Recording: (8537/ 9621) 
well i suppose well i decided that i was going to date a black guy and my dad did not like that at all so he disowned me and so now i am married to my husband and 

Recording: (8538/ 9621) 
but with kids in there just so much more active at an early age 

Recording: (8539/ 9621) 
do you know a group called midnight oil yeah they are pretty good i like them yeah 

Recording: (8540/ 9621) 
and i think that is a good sign but i think there is a huge there is millions of children that do not have any healthcare and that is not right there is a lot of between the lower and the upper there is a huge disparity but at least it is a step in the right direction we have a nice solid middle income base i think because a lot of countries only have the like i visited mexico and it seems like they only had the distinction between the upper and lower i mean their middle class is very small and that but that economy is coming along too and i mean it it will be it is developing itself which is which was nice i took a tour of a plant down there because my my old man had business down there so i went down just to see it and like it seems like it was coming along and they treat their workers better granted those workers make the equivalent of like seven bucks a day but they get they get bused into work because none of them have cars and then on top of that they all get a meal because they are like like a hot meal like they have a cafeteria there because i was talking to the one of the managers and he said if we do not do that then they will not be thinking about our quality and they will be thinking about getting food and they will be hungry so it hurts our quality so for them it was worth it and i think 

Recording: (8541/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8542/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8543/ 9621) 
well like i said before i think screening would be very difficult especially because at that age you are going to have a lot of people who are you know people say things to say things and to get a reaction and to tell their friends that they said i mean you know they can play off whatever and unless they were you know 

Recording: (8544/ 9621) 
i do not know that they would use the information that they had it i do not know 

Recording: (8545/ 9621) 
i mean no crash or anything but was rather scared kind of shaken up by it but no they are very very serious about designated drivers 

Recording: (8546/ 9621) 
well most people think it is something they rely on like well the money getting from the lottery to the people or lottery to schools on that issue then yeah i agree with the gambling thing just as long as it is like social drinking in a sense because if you have people just go out like today i bought a $1 lottery ticket won two bucks off of it so i kept my $1 and got a $1 ad and on yeah there is and then then there is these um a little bit more expensive cards you buy the lottery cards one of them is called battleship that i have won a lot of money off of 

Recording: (8547/ 9621) 
did not hear about that 

Recording: (8548/ 9621) 
and work later then which was fine by me or he would call and he would say is it okay if i work a little late tonight would you care if i stayed here a couple more hours which i think is really nice there are a lot of men that 

Recording: (8549/ 9621) 
oh gosh that is really going around a lot 

Recording: (8550/ 9621) 
he always says 

Recording: (8551/ 9621) 
they set different rules up fine give me two more minutes to play 

Recording: (8552/ 9621) 
it is a little farther 

Recording: (8553/ 9621) 
yeah true so are you obviously computer literate yes is your roommate helping you with this no actually my roommate is in colorado right now and he is going to be there 

Recording: (8554/ 9621) 
not at that time 

Recording: (8555/ 9621) 
yeah i know 

Recording: (8556/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8557/ 9621) 
um actually it is more it is almost actually turned into like a self business like i said it started out with my dad and then people would ask me what i was doing i would tell them they would be like oh i have some things around the house that need to be done and so i would go there and they would tell people and 

Recording: (8558/ 9621) 
teachers a couple teachers decide to take a bunch of kids every couple years they go to different countries 

Recording: (8559/ 9621) 
that would probably change my decision a little bit 

Recording: (8560/ 9621) 
well yeah 

Recording: (8561/ 9621) 
i know 

Recording: (8562/ 9621) 
and they fly checks like if you write a check today and you deposit it in the bank well that check has to go from your bank to clearing house and that is all they do all night long 

Recording: (8563/ 9621) 
you are grounded 

Recording: (8564/ 9621) 
yeah so basically i learned with him yall have to go do this do that 

Recording: (8565/ 9621) 
a little geography would not hurt 

Recording: (8566/ 9621) 
that is her job is to spoil them so the poor things have the belly hanging on the ground 

Recording: (8567/ 9621) 
oh yeah and you know what i cook meat for my husband i really do not cook red meat because he is on the road with his job and i know he stops at fast food places but i cook him chicken and pork and i make soups a lot of good soups for him with meat and it really does not bother me to cook it you know i am not going to sit home and make it roast every night 

Recording: (8568/ 9621) 
i have already learned an immense amount looking at your url thing okay so belgium is a 

Recording: (8569/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8570/ 9621) 
yeah

really 

Recording: (8600/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (8601/ 9621) 
i think there is a heck of a lot more to it than what we will probably ever know they really have not checked into the background of the parents as to what their beliefs were and everything and i think that is a shame because you mentioned it before about something accidentally happening where some kid shoots another kid and the parents are responsible for it and everything these two kids deliberately went in to kill and they wanted to kill more than what they killed then they killed themselves so we will never know from their end point why they did it but i think there is gotta be something that we can find out from their parents as to how they live you know they could have been anything yeah they could have been down and it could have been making him making him do it you know

we had a little gallery we were in clintonville for a year or so and then we moved to grandview it was just fine art we call it fine art crafts and it was handmade stuff from local people we had a lot of jewelry pottery silk and paintings that kind of stuff 

Recording: (8635/ 9621) 
you know he says that e equals mc squared i say it is e equals mc cubed because the world is three dimensional it is not two dimensional two dimensional limits everything but you look at his theory of relativity all of our mathematical theorems physical theorems on physics and things of that nature have been based off that 

Recording: (8636/ 9621) 
no i think we are only friends inside the class i mean a lot of them i have known from middle school and following them up and you know they just all go their different ways like the one girl i was friends with at willow park i mean she was a grade lower than me but when we would seen each other in the halls like hey what is up and we would talk and you know what is going on and we are doing this after school and that in high school i did not know anything i know she was bad and that was it 

Recording: (8637/ 9621) 
no that is okay i just do not want to touch it 

Recording: (8638/ 9621) 
it was just like that i am telling you it was and we would see you know they would put things on the screen for us to watch i mean i learned a lot of stuff it was a very good experience i went through very good 

Recording: (8639/ 9621)

Recording: (8642/ 9621) 
that would be good 

Recording: (8643/ 9621) 
i am not going to do it 

Recording: (8644/ 9621) 
oh i do not really think so i think of myself as kind of an impatient person but i guess i do not get as shocked by some of the things they do as some people do and i do not yell and scream at them i mean i realize they did not ask to have a learning disability i mean and they can not some teachers think they are just being belligerent and if they want to straighten up they could and what i try to tell those teachers is they can not change their learning disability anymore you can change your brown eyes you know they were born with it it is genetic someone else in their family has it they can learn they just do not learn the same way everybody else does you have to break it down into pieces or teach it a different way it is like teaching a math problem two different ways you get the same answer but one way works better for you well that is how they are you know maybe they do not learn well by listening maybe they do not learn well by looking at a chart or something maybe they only learn well when they are up moving around doing something you know you just have to understand that their avenues of learning are like different than yours and totally some of them might be totally screwed up like they might hear half of what you say or they might jumble up what you say and you say turn to page 393 here and they turn to 339 in their book and they think they did what you said it is just like something is mixed up between the actual eye and the ear and then where it gets interpreted into the brain it gets all scrambled somehow and i always tell teachers if you could just walk for one day in their shoes you would probably have a lot of empathy for them 

Recording: (8645/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8646/ 9621) 
mmm 

Recording: (8647/ 9621)

Recording: (8725/ 9621) 
mmhmm right there 

Recording: (8726/ 9621) 
you know to get a $4 or $5 a year tax cut 

Recording: (8727/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (8728/ 9621) 
it should be important but the students that are at the other end need the help too a lot of people think if you have a child that is gifted that all your problems are solved it is not it is a different set of problems there is personality quirks that go with that emotional issues 

Recording: (8729/ 9621) 
i will raise them the best way i can 

Recording: (8730/ 9621) 
during the depression my grandfather moved over here and then asked her 

Recording: (8731/ 9621) 
ready willing to do that again 

Recording: (8732/ 9621) 
right right 

Recording: (8733/ 9621) 
yeah it is like the woman that used to live in the apartment where we lived before us see she had a husband that she was married to for quite some time he got on ohio is number one dui list with 18 duis man can you imagine how much money he is put into that i mean you would think your first dui offense would be about a thousand dollar fine and weekend in jail or something but 18 of them and you are racking up all that money and all those legal bills and all that time i think he is in jail now 

Recording: (8734/ 9621) 
civil rights well i take the extreme position that civil rights are an illusion yeah they are on paper which is a good thing because it was a terrible thing when there were laws that restricted someone because of their ethnic background or because of their gender but i think in many ways it has had little effect on creating an equal and fair society maybe some of my leftist positions will come out right now people have the freedom but i believe that based upon where in the social stratum you are born in the united states you have a limited ability to move upward and that these class i do not want to say class lines because that has so many historical connotations because it is not the exact same as say class was in the marxist sense but class lines still today very much follow race lines and what good is like knowing that you have the freedom to vote when you know painfully well that you are not going to be able to get a job that is gonna buy a house for your family and let them live in relative comfort i mean in real terms in things i think are valuable to the individual 

Recording: (8735/ 9621) 
yeah for everybody so it is kind of a really big deal and my parents are the oldest from their families too so it is a first great grandchild and with my husband he is the oldest so for everybody 

Recording: (8736/ 9621) 
i do not know where i am going to find you honestly i am thinking of doing a career flight 

Recording: (8737/ 9621) 
so yeah 

Recording: (8738/ 9621) 
or limited very limited 

Recording: (8739/ 9621) 
it is an island but a planet together i liked it there i kind of like it and i figure they will probably hook up but i do not like how the show this show and this happened with deep space nine too and even with next generation for a little bit how the shows become soap operalike i mean the romantic aspects of the stories do not really appeal to me very much i am more interested in the social things than good old special effects but i think i like that how it is kept with a sort of tension and it is not like they are not completely thrown together like belanna and tom which i do not like that at all 

Recording: (8740/ 9621) 
better than that much dirt so whenever we heard any firing like it was coming toward us we would head for that hole 

Recording: (8741/ 9621) 
i have a five hour course the first term of summer quarter 

Recording: (8742/ 9621) 
yes yes you might make millions you could retire young really 

Recording: (8743/ 9621) 
is that right 

Recording: (8744/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8745/ 9621) 
i did not know that 

Recording: (8746/ 9621) 
totally left that part out no one felt me in about no throwing up or anything that really made me mad 

Recording: (8747/ 9621) 
i just think it is a different time now i do not think i think everybody is living more for today and talking about the future you know hoping that the future is there i think there is a quote unquote end time aspect to life you know 

Recording: (8748/ 9621) 
you know now 

Recording: (8749/ 9621) 
okay good 

Recording: (8750/ 9621) 
trying to cram organic into my head 

Recording: (8751/ 9621) 
what did you spend most of your time doing besides snorkeling 

Recording: (8752/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8753/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (8754/ 9621) 
but you understand what i am saying you are going to have to make it so the guns that you got are harder to conceal 

Recording: (8755/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8756/ 9621) 
right right and again if it is criminal activity you want somebody to stop it and know about it but if it is i am not doing anything i want anybody to know about and it wants to prevent them from going and finding out what some company is doing what research is that is a threat on the web too is that you can connect into somebody is system and they do not know you are there and you can see what they are doing if they are doing research you know developing a new product or something you can you know that is corporate espionage and i am sure that is going on and i have heard cases of it yeah well and the thing is people are real sharp and no matter what you do they will find a way around you know nobody is found a way to prevent people from getting in and people are real good about finding new ways to do it 

Recording: (8757/ 9621) 
but it is teaching him discipline responsibility you can not do these things at this time you know 

Recording: (8758/ 9621) 
i am sure it makes it easier but i think that a person can establish a relationship you just have to put the effort into it and decide to have that relationship and so i think that even if i were working you know with my oldest daughter i worked but i arranged my life around her so that even though i had that degree i waited tables because when she was little before she started school i could go to work at five in the evening and she went to bed at 730 so i was with her all day then when she started school i switched over to lunches and so i have always arranged my life around my children so i have an opportunity to be with them 

Recording: (8759/ 9621) 
well they were none of my friends that were pregnant and i am not sure they you know i just remember a couple girls that were pregnant i do not i was not friends with them and i am not sure about who their boyfriends were or anything like that 

Recording: (8760/ 9621) 
a building or some target that we could see 

Recording: (8761/ 9621) 
yes we are both i have gotten kind of bad but my husband is a marathon trainer i try to run with her at least two to three times a week because he is too fast for her but we go to hoffman farms up in off of cosgrain hilliard i am not sure if it is in hilliard but we have taken her to the scioto park 

Recording: (8762/ 9621) 
my father moved here yes 

Recording: (8763/ 9621) 
but the trouble is we do not fit the horse with the proper carriage load and we need to do that in our society we need to work as a team there is no sense of having five guards on a basketball team if you do not have a center you can tip it off and rebound 

Recording: (8764/ 9621) 
yeah yeah they do 

Recording: (8765/ 9621) 
well it starts with allowing heather has two mommies 

Recording: (8766/ 9621) 
yeah i think basically normal hours would be like 8 to 12 and then you go home during lunchtime because that is the big meal of the day you go home and eat with your family that is really important 

Recording: (8767/ 9621) 
it is just a rule 

Recording: (8768/ 9621) 
there was this one guy had i do not know how many several herds of sheep need to hire i think they were mexicans 

Recording: (8769/ 9621) 
so it is very parttime and i am a fulltime student so i was working somewhere else before but i needed somewhere on campus 

Recording: (8770/ 9621) 
where she works and this is just osu is breast cancer place 

Recording: (8771/ 9621) 
you just keep going that is part of life you pick up something you learn it and you keep going 

Recording: (8772/ 9621) 
ai not no way 

Recording: (8773/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (8774/ 9621) 
it does not have any words in it like exacerbate or undoubtedly i will tell you that 

Recording: (8775/ 9621) 
yeah across the street is the dental and the hospital so people were really loud down there 

Recording: (8776/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8777/ 9621) 
basically they did not legally adopt him or anything but they are the ones that he considers his family really and i mean he still keeps in contact with his mom and his dad but it is always kind of a challenge for him 

Recording: (8778/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (8779/ 9621) 
why are you doing it now and then my youngest one she likes to dress totally different she is sort of like a little bit of a preppy but she does not understand why people want to have like eyes out on their shirt or a name on their pants and she says i just think that is stupid she says you can buy nice clothes without that so neither one of them pressured me and the one thing that was really odd when they were little is we would go like to toys r us and up and down the rows and i see kids it is like you know and they would walk over and pick something up and go and then put it back down and keep walking and it is like you know i told joyce i says you know i feel like i am an ogre because are they terrified to even ask for this stuff and she goes no she says they do not not want it she says they just want to see what it is like you know because their favorite toy when they were little is i would go to what do you call it lazy boy and get five or six of them killer boxes from the sofas and the chairs and take a knife and cut doors in it and they would play with that for weeks you know until somebody one of their friends would come over and have a little accident and then we go well we have to build a new house but you know they just reading and playing with stuff like that they enjoyed you know 

Recording: (8780/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (8781/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (8782/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8783/ 9621) 
so i was like in shape very well i was in very good shape 

Recording: (8784/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8785/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8786/ 9621) 
ha ha ha 

Recording: (8787/ 9621) 
so i mean basically my opinion on that is just leave it up to them i mean if they want to take the risks obviously they know 

Recording: (8788/ 9621) 
no they should talk about i think they should talk about that too i never did it and i wish i could have waited until i was married but you are going through that whatever you go through when you are a teenager so you are like so what well most kids i am not some kids still do that but i think yes i do think they should put that in it also 

Recording: (8789/ 9621) 
i work at a company plus i help out at the bva vietnam veterans association 

Recording: (8790/ 9621) 
yes and no i mean in high school it was a bunch of little things here it is not so much a lot of things 

Recording: (8791/ 9621) 
ha ha 

Recording: (8792/ 9621) 
everybody needs to know that information for credit cards 

Recording: (8793/ 9621) 
i 

Recording: (8794/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (8795/ 9621) 
now most of my paintings were completed before like 1995 1996 before it came back out it was more of a thing like images from my childhood coming back out and now it is suddenly you hear about it more often so that is why i am a little funny about it used to be proud like i paint star wars 

Recording: (8796/ 9621) 
high on their horse yeah some of them are too 

Recording: (8797/ 9621) 
yeah i could imagine 

Recording: (8798/ 9621) 
i know exactly 

Recording: (8799/ 9621) 
uh huh 

Recording: (8800/ 9621) 
yeah so they adjusted that but then they did not have any way to enforce that 

Recording: (8801/ 9621) 
hopefully 

Recording: (8802/ 9621) 
no i am definitely in favor of that i mean yes the parent is supposed to do it and one would hope that the parent would get there before the health class did but if the parent is not going to get there it is the only way they are ever going to find out 

Recording: (8803/ 9621) 
that is where we figure in a few years he will be fine it is just getting there it is been very difficult i mean there is times when we did not know where he was for a week at a time i was driving lane avenue once and saw him begging money on the street it is a pretty heavy load to go through it really is 

Recording: (8804/ 9621) 
mmm 

Recording: (8805/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (8806/ 9621) 
mhm 

Recording: (8807/ 9621) 
in the meantime you know you got to pay the bills so you know i am not sure what she wants to do she is had so many different kinds of jobs parttime jobs though you know when she was younger like 10 years ago she wanted to have her own talk show 

Recording: (8808/ 9621) 
but with people coming back later and saying that they changed their mind and stuff as the adoptive parents i would be concerned about that but that is not going to happen in this case i do not think and because of her age and this makes no sense to me the state law says that she has to have custody of the child for 72 hours before she can give it up for adoption because of her age and it does not make sense to me so they are talking to a social worker now to find out they do not want to take the baby home because they are afraid of being too attached to it then and they do not think it is a good atmosphere for it because her mother smokes constantly her mother is alcoholic 

Recording: (8809/ 9621) 
because you do have to have a higher education most of the time to do anything these days so they definitely have to have their 

Recording: (8810/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8811/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (8812/ 9621) 
actually you can have well they usually go together some kids have learning disabilities without the adhd and some have adhd without the learning disability and some have both and you can have add without having the hyperactive part you can have attention deficit disorder with what they call hypoactivity and that is the student that is kind of spacey and kind of dreamy and they never cause any trouble but they are kind of like out of touch with reality and they are always looking out the window and like the other one that says i did not hear what was the question and they are add and they can not quite focus and distract they can not screen out the distractions but because they are not hyper they are not always doing this and they are not bothering people they are kind of the they are the ones that usually get lost in the shuffle those are the kids that are real cooperative and they are always smiling they are kind of spaced out and daydreaming and it takes a long time to realize and this kid can not focus but with the kid that is all over the place and doing the tapping this kid is chair and the kid goes make him stop tapping my chair you know you can see right away that he can not focus because when you are he asks you for help and you come over to explain something to him and he is like all over the place while you are explaining he is not listening you are trying to show him something he will not look at it you know it is like people often say add kids can not focus or can not attend to anything but what is really happening is they attend to everything 

Recording: (8813/ 9621) 
five stars what is your major needle pointing finger paints journalism medicine okay crosswords okay that gives our younger people some mentors to look after does not it and what are your scores in those oh i am just barely getting by passwords but that is a problem we have lacked the standards no that is their right keep it private but no i wish those guys would just spell hey i am majoring in accounting i am majoring in finance i am majoring in business and i got 35 i got 26 and whatever the criteria is to play on the team why are not you playing this week well i am practicing i am still required to practice even though i can not play this week why can not you play it is a rule what rule well if i do not make certain things during the week which is academic i still have to perform sportswise make that commitment but if i fall through in that then i am off the team period but those are things that need to be publicized more instead of saying well hey we brought this much ticket gate this month and you got this scores and this percentage is that we need to expand more on that so that the younger people have better role models to look at and not just playing round ball or the spiral we need to get them out there and say how are you going to perform in school i am sure michael red is got some mentors out there you see guys wearing number five and whatever the number is eight and whatever okay there is a reason for it but what is the other part of it we do not do it because why we do not want to bring it up we do not want to bring some embarrassment possibly but that is part of life when they get out in the real world i am talking about these guys some will be successful in terms of whomever and some will be successful in other people is eyes but the thing is show the kids that are watching them hey there is more than just sports sports is a byproduct here at ohio state 

Recording: (8814/ 9621) 
nah 

Recording: (8815/ 9621) 
crime is a lot worse now you know on the streets than it used to be 

Recording: (8816/ 9621) 
no nothing at all it was known that he was the father like i said i mean he was kind of just one of those kids and i mean he did not listen to anyone or anything and he ended up like running away from home basically like i said going out to colorado and like all he did was drive down there his car broke down his parents like wired him money for him to get a plane ticket to come back and he ended up just taking the money fixing his car with it and kept on going 

Recording: (8817/ 9621) 
you know just turn right out in front of you everybody is running red lights nowadays i mean which laws you gonna pick out to enforce and which laws ai not you 

Recording: (8818/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (8819/ 9621) 
the parenting stuff they gave us a video to watch at home which was things like how to diaper your baby whether you should leave them crying in their bassinet or crib which i think is horrible and i think it is good that they have come out with all these new studies that tell people not to do that let is see what else was there 

Recording: (8820/ 9621) 
the reds and indians 

Recording: (8821/ 9621)

Recording: (8822/ 9621)

commitment you know can not just be your roommate 

Recording: (8824/ 9621)

Recording: (8825/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8826/ 9621) 
he did not 

Recording: (8827/ 9621) 
because i have always liked to fix up my own house 

Recording: (8828/ 9621) 
i love it 

Recording: (8829/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8830/ 9621) 
not if he would been as open about it as he was here clinton did that also and thought he would be able to desegregate the military and fan out with his first action as president there is a strong backlash against that at least nationwide and in the military but i thought it was the right stance 

Recording: (8831/ 9621) 
to 

Recording: (8832/ 9621) 
well i know and you know when i think back about that week it was just crazy because it was on a saturday morning she went into labor so i was up all night saturday and all day sunday i did not get home till sunday night and then his brother from vancouver his daughter from canada and his mom from florida were staying with us and they were leaving that tuesday so 

Recording: (8833/ 9621) 
i would not have been smiling from down there to up here when he dropped me off he did not even know 

Recording: (8834/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (8835/ 9621) 
yeah i did 

Recording: (8836/ 9621) 
i had that with the parakeet i had before their lifespan in the wild is about five years seven years in captivity and he was 13 

Recording: (8837/ 9621) 
just from what he is learned 

Recording: (8838/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (8839/ 9621) 
so this boy whatever he did there is no doubt in my mind that he either heard internal voices or actual audible voices of spirits that were misguided spirits 

Recording: (8840/ 9621) 
she works at franklin university she is an assistant vice president there 

Recording: (8841/ 9621)

Recording: (8858/ 9621) 
and then i would expect that if there was a problem that they would make sure that they kept me there but i think a day and a half is perfectly reasonable i mean i do not know i have never done this before so i can not really say but i mean my feeling is the least amount of time i have to be in the hospital the happier i am going to be 

Recording: (8859/ 9621) 
i can not even go out and sign that long i have had melanoma cancer and stuff so i sold my boat now mainly my hobby is just tinkering around stuff i will buy a car fix it up and sell it

i like to stay right around columbus 

Recording: (8868/ 9621) 
i mean that was 

Recording: (8869/ 9621) 
almost like an admission film where the family is living with the animals in the same house and you try to understand and you will never they will never get away from poverty and the classes in our society that is just life we are always going to be that but the thing is try to have understanding and compassion for them and try to reach out and sometimes people do not want it either and sometimes you can say well now i know why they do not want it because they do not know they do not know how to handle it they appreciate the thought that goes a lot longer than just giving them that because of the given they do not do with it so i really i really think i always say traveling people are all the same worldwide they just give them different colors different facial different accents so god can give them unique characteristics so he can call them his own he knows each one of us but we are all the same when we sit down talking about the emotions that drive you and i keep asking one thing to ask yourself and ask the business person what would you be doing today if you were born in a third world country how thankful are you that you are here and how do you show that thankfulness 

Recording: (8870/ 9621) 
no they were from all over the world i had one companion who was from russia but she was on a temporary mission mostly all over america but there was a girl from mongolia there was girls there who i never was companions with them but they were from russia there was a girl from moscow my mission president was actually from st petersburg and his wife they did not speak english

Recording: (8879/ 9621) 
technology i mean i like living in a world where technology puts everything i need at my fingertips i mean i think that is something that would not have happened had there not been a highly populist generation suddenly that was competing within itself 

Recording: (8880/ 9621)

Recording: (8881/ 9621) 
i disagree with society there it should be something to work with it is just like hey well let us see you are going to have this year obrien ah we are going to have a losing season i do not care

Recording: (8924/ 9621) 
mmhmm yeah it is an old eye sore that they should have got rid of years ago 

Recording: (8925/ 9621) 
right right 

Recording: (8926/ 9621) 
so the original father was not around for the kids 

Recording: (8927/ 9621) 
mhm right 

Recording: (8928/ 9621) 
yeah it is a good idea 

Recording: (8929/ 9621) 
the core is 

Recording: (8930/ 9621) 
but then again i feel like sometimes i am so naive i mean a lot of that was not introduced and i was just like well should i have known that 

Recording: (8931/ 9621) 
yes they do 

Recording: (8932/ 9621) 
and i do not know whether orrin did or not he is never said anything if he has but i think my attitude would be do not tell and you know the guys that come out very vociferously in favor of publicizing it and all that i do not see what they expect to gain i mean if theyin fact in fact i do not i do not think that they do gain anything by it 

Recording: (8933/ 9621) 
yeah so i am a new grandma 

Recording: (8934/ 9621) 
i think one of the things that we when you are baptized is that you are really supposed to help other people to like if somebody gives you a gift you want to give it to someone else but it is easy a lot of times just to fall into the you know like mold of not letting anyone know what you believe and just so that they think well what are those weirdos you know they do not wear makeup or whatever but we can wear makeup if we want but so i think for a lot of times people do fall in just sort of but i was not raised mormon so i have a lot of my family and friends who are still not members of the church and also because it is so new to me that i am just you know i will talk about it with anybody and and and so and i am also not afraid of people who are not mormons because i think if you grow up like a member of the church and you might be more afraid of people that do not believe like you have been taught i think a lot of the you know we do not drink alcohol there is a lot of restrictions i guess you would call them restrictions but i feel like they are more just health codes that just keep you healthy so it might be it is like if america we are used to being raised one way if we went to another country just kind of like you might want to get to know the chinese people but you might not quite be a little timid about you know same kind of thing but i do not have any of those barriers 

Recording: (8935/ 9621) 
well i mean 

Recording: (8936/ 9621) 
badly but 

Recording: (8937/ 9621) 
a couple that are adopted will be able to get counseling for her 

Recording: (8938/ 9621) 
when you are 55 or is it 62 whatever age is it age limitation or based upon age or disability or being out of town you are allowed so routinely we have done the absentee over the years no going back to basic politicians i think the vast majority are truly good honest people they try to mean well i am concerned always that people who go into politics are in fine shape when they start but the tremendous influences are brought to bear that they never had had the opportunity to comprehend before they got there and they are just overwhelmed i do not necessarily think it is a dishonesty it is like a tidal wave they get caught up and they can not resist the direction it is being pushed or they are being pushed 

Recording: (8939/ 9621) 
and now it is our turn to deal with the issues we see our parents we see this generation all these things that are still popular so we do not look down on the 60s i mean i think the 60s sound like a pretty fun time to live i will get into politics in a second but those things are popularized but no we can not do it anymore because we have got all these problems 

Recording: (8940/ 9621) 
oh come back i mean if you need me to 

Recording: (8941/ 9621) 
heheheheheheheheh 

Recording: (8942/ 9621) 
whenever it comes on i roll my eyes that episode where they were stuck out in space and if the tape can catch me rolling my eyes 

Recording: (8943/ 9621) 
and then i am probably going to be working on my portfolio the second term 

Recording: (8944/ 9621) 
or northland 

Recording: (8945/ 9621) 
and so i got some of the inside dope out of the area from him but they hadi do not know whether it had been a large granary or something that had a concrete floor and some industrious gi had chipped a hole about so big around in that 

Recording: (8946/ 9621) 
yeah i am okay yeah it is only it is still 10 till 7 yeah 

Recording: (8947/ 9621) 
yeah where would you send it if you could send us to one of the tv programs and have like oprah winfrey or somewhere and get it all over the world you know all of the united states or something so people really hear it then maybe it would might do some good if people would begin to speak up you know what why do not they start some type of a television program with questions like this and what do people really think it would help to do instead of having things like oprah winfrey and who is those other couple guys to get on and ask the most stupid questions and 

Recording: (8948/ 9621) 
which i have never done i do not want to but to me some drugs should be legal some drugs should be illegal but to me alcohol should be more illegal than half your drugs 

Recording: (8949/ 9621) 
homosexuality i guess 

Recording: (8950/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (8951/ 9621) 
but at the same time i do not think i would really hold it against him 

Recording: (8952/ 9621) 
oh my gosh it is one of them like you know falling out of trees 

Recording: (8953/ 9621) 
and we would adjust the guns call down shifts so they could come within reasonable close to that 

Recording: (8954/ 9621) 
because she has been known to help herself to bread we were like brain dead after this race and my husband took her and we know better but we were like you know after you run you are kind of like ehhh and she actually jumped up on the table and looked around and took a piece of bread i am like oh my gosh 

Recording: (8955/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8956/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (8957/ 9621) 
yeah and i get to argue about stuff there here i am just kind of sitting around 

Recording: (8958/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (8959/ 9621) 
you like the university level 

Recording: (8960/ 9621) 
actually being able to resend the funding but still i mean it is a we do not like to think about these things happening 

Recording: (8961/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (8962/ 9621) 
and i do not know whether my second i do not think my second sister ever went to school out there but things were so tough that and mom had taught school in iowa where she grew up and got her teacher is certificate so i guess she and dad agreed that if they could find someone to stay with us kids through the day she could teach 

Recording: (8963/ 9621) 
no not really i do not know what even is to eat down here oxley is 

Recording: (8964/ 9621) 
well let us see i got divorced when i oldest was three my youngest was about six months almost a year so i have raised them basically myself yeah so i did go back to work 

Recording: (8965/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (8966/ 9621) 
it is just like bingo numbers 

Recording: (8967/ 9621) 
it is kind of funny you are allowed to drink before you are allowed to drive 

Recording: (8968/ 9621) 
i was a baby you know under one 

Recording: (8969/ 9621) 
there is too much information and too much change librarians this is against probably what the image of librarians are they are very eager to embrace change internet came out and when it got out of the area it was being used by universities or whatever for research that is what it was at first librarians were right there and they wanted more and more and they wanted to figure out what they could do with it pcs it was revolutionary when we announced that we were going to use ibm pcs for access to the system and we would provide you software you could do some of the work that you are used to doing with us in your computer it was incredible we had trouble with the demand it was triple what we expected librarians were ready for it 

Recording: (8970/ 9621) 
and it is great we have been reengineered the last eight years odot downsizing and trying to fit the attributes the person brings to work as opposed to one of the problems i see as an employer or supervisor manager a lot of times we have to promote because well the bureaucracy says you have to do this in order to get up there they do not take into consideration the attributes the person has so now we are saying okay if you bring this attribute to the table and you can help the team out then why not reward you instead of putting you over here in let us say a managerial position which you really do not have any call for but you are there because the money only okay so we are trying to fit the attribute to the person and compensate them accordingly which hey i think we did that we probably have more teachers 

Recording: (8971/ 9621) 
and why do not people use their time and it is free rather they get all tensed up and mad because they left five minutes late and expect everybody to get out of their way because they got to get there 

Recording: (8972/ 9621) 
lol 

Recording: (8973/ 9621) 
mmm 

Recording: (8974/ 9621) 
and the house smells wonderful it is like birthday cakes i think my wife is was the last one i make her one and we trade off and i bought a betty crocker at odd lots it was $022 the icing was $022 i made it and everybody goes this is really good it is like a sour cream icing and i go yeah and they go boy this is really good and they go did you buy this and i go no i made it and they go really and i go yeah it cost me $044 

Recording: (8975/ 9621) 
there is no need to attack students over it and i read some article in the lantern i do not know why i read that i hate that paper but anyway i read some article that the guy said he is not trying to attack students he just wants them to get annoyed so they will go whine to their parents about how the university does it and then they can all fight the establishment 

Recording: (8976/ 9621) 
but like if you said we will have a bus service we will go and pick you guys up you know and then you can not use the excuse my car broke down or something and then like if you even to give them like it does not even have to be a hot meal i would think for breakfast or anything you know if you are running three shifts you could just you know here is a box of donuts and some milk or something you know and that does not cost the company that much 

Recording: (8977/ 9621) 
why not the c caller and i mean that is not something that you would think a head coach at a high stake would say you know 

Recording: (8978/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (8979/ 9621) 
and there is tubes and all that i mean i remember seeing that like in eighth grade and looking at that thinking that is me you know 

Recording: (8980/ 9621) 
i learned about them from somebody i was working with who liked them and listened to a lot of their music he loaned me some and i taped it i saw their video their wall street gorilla video i do not know if you have ever seen that it was fun it was fun 

Recording: (8981/ 9621) 
i helped him set up different things helped him clean him up afterwards prep patients all kinds of different things that was a lot of blood and stuff but i do not know when it is not you it seems a little easier to observe i guess when you see somebody you know it is a little more concerning to you i do not know but you see a lot of different stuff and i hope that the majority of it is helping this person out now my wife you know she works she worked in intensive care open heart surgery different patients like that and that is a lot different than where she is now with the cancer because there is so many different factors there you know she says it is so hard to see somebody 30 years old and they come in and they have breast cancer or something like that and you have to go in and tell them these things she says you know two or three times a week you know your heart just drops out because you see that they have their little kids and now you are going to be going for chemotherapy radiation all this stuff you know it is unbelievable how many it is just hard to believe how many people go through there they are talking 50 60 patients a day 

Recording: (8982/ 9621) 
you know what i mean it do not matter to me whether you are black or white it matters to me whatever way you treat me like when i first got out of the services when they really started affirmative action i was going to get a job in the trucking industry and they could not hire me because that was when they first come down with a mandate that they could only hire blacks 

Recording: (8983/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (8984/ 9621) 
the risks and what goes into it and like i said i mean it does not really hurt anyone the high part of it 

Recording: (8985/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8986/ 9621) 
and it is interesting that they advertise that when you go there though if you get that room that is what you get 

Recording: (8987/ 9621) 
so they can tend to they will eat all day cats yeah you just put a bowl of kitten chow that is their life you know 

Recording: (8988/ 9621) 
i went there for career center in high school and that was something that was exciting for me but that is totally out of the question for me now because i have a kid and there is no way i would do that 

Recording: (8989/ 9621) 
so like 30 of them will go out at one time and 30 will come back well that is not too bad but they are mixed in with everybody else that is normally flying like all the airliners and stuff and they want to get their asap so i just do not feel comfortable doing that much at one time osu was not a dead place it was very busy it is like the third busiest in ohio but yeah it is amazing and they are only open 16 hours a day 

Recording: (8990/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (8991/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8992/ 9621) 
yeah you 

Recording: (8993/ 9621) 
um actually i guess it is something that is always sort of been there i have always been real big on just building things i mean been real big hands on and last summer i helped my dad build a garage onto his house like i mean literally i mean we poured the foundation and everything like built everything up from there and it turned out really well and i mean it was really fun to do i mean it is i liked it a lot better than being stuck inside all the time 

Recording: (8994/ 9621) 
gun control i am not really too interested in i mean you look at israel people are carrying guns on the street big huge guns and they are one of the safest nations in the country then you look at england they have no guns at all and they are relatively safe so i mean 

Recording: (8995/ 9621) 
and get my loan shark in trouble 

Recording: (8996/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8997/ 9621)

i am sorry 

Recording: (8999/ 9621) 
she will be 19 in september 

Recording: (9000/ 9621) 
mmm i was not there that long 

Recording: (9001/ 9621) 
you know because then what does he have to hide and then like the fact that he did not know like i think on international policy he will be struggling if he becomes president he did not know the three leaders of the world thing and then on top of it like texas is a fairly big economy but still like to manage an entire you know an entire economy 

Recording: (9002/ 9621) 
oh definitely definitely well i have never had a dog and i have always wanted one 

Recording: (9003/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9004/ 9621) 
and it stays with you for years they do not realize that nobody tells them until after the fact 

Recording: (9005/ 9621) 
uh huh 

Recording: (9006/ 9621) 
like i am not really sure how the interview works to become a teacher i do not know i think it is like a lot of times they are really desperate to find people and so they really just take whoever i mean they are lucky enough to even have a body to fill the place and they are doing well enough i mean the kids are learning the material i mean sort of i mean it is working well enough i guess i mean people are learning things and wanting to go on to college and stuff 

Recording: (9007/ 9621) 
well i have had the house for probably six or seven years and we just need to move it is kind of small it is a smaller house my husband works in gahanna so we were going to look for some houses up that way and maybe some land we have been looking at some land up north too 

Recording: (9008/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (9009/ 9621) 
that would be like you know what the hell they putting on some kind of gay race to make you gay yeah 

Recording: (9010/ 9621) 
yeah we probably eventually will do that but i am like so up in the air about what i want to do and there is so many things to do out there that i need to take time to think about it 

Recording: (9011/ 9621) 
it is like with this adoption of the baby we know that that is best but dealing with the emotions of it we are very family oriented and this is a grandchild we will never see 

Recording: (9012/ 9621) 
ha ha ha ha ha 

Recording: (9013/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (9014/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9015/ 9621) 
it 

Recording: (9016/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9017/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (9018/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9019/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (9020/ 9621) 
yeah i can not you went to europe and you missed spain oh okay see that will be it you can plan that as a second honeymoon i am sure your wife would object sure you are just gonna it is just it is just wow this has blown my mind so i said okay spanish looks good so it is just a degree so i can just get out and go and travel like you say a lot of these companies a lot of these like you say well you know i do not of state so are you out to campus actually i live at riverwatch towers on lane avenue much nicer than the dorms oh no it is like right across the street oh yeah i got like two roommates i highly recommend the roommate thing oh yeah it is like i guess it is kind of like a hostile environment it is like you get to know everybody it is pretty much an apartment you become friends with everybody off that i am hoping that is the same deal when i travel it is easy to make friends and hook up and say oh you got a job hook me up 

Recording: (9021/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (9022/ 9621) 
i mean come on who was not picked on you know 

Recording: (9023/ 9621) 
she got a divorce when i was three 

Recording: (9024/ 9621) 
you do not use coupons 

Recording: (9025/ 9621) 
which is not a lot 

Recording: (9026/ 9621) 
mwahaha 

Recording: (9027/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9028/ 9621) 
then you can go visit what the empire is at the big thing like the statue of liberty 

Recording: (9029/ 9621) 
it is yeah because pediatricians are able to dispense it i just felt like trying to avoid it as much as possible growing up 

Recording: (9030/ 9621) 
but when you look at coleman there was a point where they asked a yes or no question 

Recording: (9031/ 9621) 
no this is sherry 

Recording: (9032/ 9621) 
i am impressed i am like okay i tried to build a car and it did not look like anything 

Recording: (9033/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (9034/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9035/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (9036/ 9621) 
yeah i think so i think so and like neither of the candidates really seem like they have that much integrity to me you know 

Recording: (9037/ 9621) 
it is probably family by family i mean that is why i was a little bit late leaving work the way it was we have got two coworkers one has her child at the same daycare as myself she is about a year now and i am listening to her i mean she is there you know 60 70 hours a week i mean she dropped off at 6 am and not picked up until 630 pm and she is fine with that me personally there is no way because somebody is totally in my opinion raising that child you are not getting to put your values your traditions what is important to you onto that child now the other girl she just has a four month old and has been in daycare now for three weeks and she is going to quit her job and go to working nights three days a week because it is important to her to be at home with him 

Recording: (9038/ 9621) 
so she so i probably did learn a little bit cuz i she is still that she is lives with the man now and he does all the cooking still so i have learned everything on my own upon cooking and stuff like that which i did love to cook 

Recording: (9039/ 9621) 
i think society of today is less tolerant of a lot of things that they see where people getting by with stuff you know and they are more vocal about it as opposed to being violent about it back in the 60s and stuff you know not here but you know down south there were people still getting hung and stuff you know for being a black or something and you know there are bad blacks and there is bad whites too but not all of them are that way 

Recording: (9040/ 9621) 
plus if they shoot somebody accidentally number one it is really hard to and secondly it probably will not kill them like a gun can and you have to use your brain so i did not come from a hunting background but my husband does work for the state highway patrol so obviously we know a lot of people that have to carry guns but none of them hardly any of them hunt and a lot of them they respect them if you know what i mean they realize they can kill people guns that is the problem it is the people that are teaching 

Recording: (9041/ 9621) 
so i am sure that probably increases the rate in public schools for 

Recording: (9042/ 9621) 
i do more summer sports but he is just beginning on the computer i am pretty computer literate i have really never had a job yet it is always been working with food or plants 

Recording: (9043/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (9044/ 9621) 
mhm 

Recording: (9045/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (9046/ 9621) 
and you register them and then you just keep after them you keep giving them information and then you just run a good get out the vote campaign in ohio i think it is easier to do that because there is a law that i do not think it is in primaries but in general elections at 11 oclock in the morning and 4 oclock in the afternoon they have to list those who have voted they have to put up a list of registered voters and cross out those who have voted so what i used to do is i took my list that i had gotten from the board of elections earlier and compared it with my list of who had shown support or was undecided on the election and i would cross off those that had voted and then i had a list of those that had not and i had people waiting at a phone bank and i would call them at work or at home and i would offer to take them to the polls if you do not have a ride we will take you to the polls if you are worried about someone watching your kids we have certified teachers who will sit in the car with your kid or will sit in your home and will babysit for you while you go to vote because i have also read studies that say people who are routed from their home or their office and are reminded to go will also vote for whatever issue or candidate has reminded them to do that because what i did was it is a very low key thing i would call people on election day and say hi this is roberta i am calling to remind you that today is election day and we hope that you will remember to exercise your most important freedom which is to go vote and oh by the way when you go to vote we hope that you will vote for such and such a school levy and if you need a ride let me know we have got them set up for you and but you know that is very i mean and that is not getting people to vote and encourage them to vote because they should that is a special campaign for a particular issue or a candidate i do not know how you get people to vote i do not know why they do not think it is important maybe because we have had it too easy my grandfather did not my grandfather did not i mean there was a king and queen and he had no right to vote so when he came here and he could that was the most important thing in the world to him and he just passed it on to his daughter my mother my father i do not know how it was important to him but it was always important to him we talked about politics at the dinner table sometimes we talked about issues and he said it was important to be heard so i do not know if it got passed on parentwise or what it was

Recording: (9060/ 9621) 
i was the only one on my whole block 

Recording: (9061/ 9621)

well they are supposed to do more too but by the time they get to fourth grade they are so busy trying to be the class clown they decide it is a lot more important to impress your friends than it is to fill your mind with knowledge 

Recording: (9130/ 9621) 
it would be interesting to see how much of your generation is saving first of all how much are they earning how much they expect to pay for a house and all these other things you know they say to you i will say 10 church then you got all g $5 here made 20 cents of 20 cents an hour here and get can get this you figure all those up all these campaigns you hear during the course of a year i often thought it would be great for marketing take all those figures and add up and see if it adds up to 100 and if it does then where are your goals see when i bought a house the financier came in and i went to his office and he said oh mr no problem no problem you can get that house i said i can yeah you are a professional and your wife is professional i said that is how you are evaluating it on both both of us yes i said i do not want to do business with you why i am going to give you a loan i said i do not want to do business with you because you did not ask me about my goals my goal was not to have my wife work because nowadays it takes two of them to work i am wondering when they are going to get child labor law revoked for that because with two of them working i am wondering how many more hours a day you can squeeze out of a couple is personal life so they will have sanity at some time in their life to enjoy life when these people start realizing hey we are chasing our tails then that couple got wise and said hey we are going to do with less and we are going to go for quality when that couple reaches that mentality mr loan officer you are going to have a greater society to work with and you will not have as many possessions i am sorry it goes against your goal but it is more positive for our for our society and that is been it my wife is been working parttime all her tenure if it is fine keep her license up she is a nurse but the thing is i do not want i did not want her i want her to be home with the kids i did not want somebody else over our kids and i do not know if our kids realize this or not but i do know my brotherinlaw mentioned to his parents he said gosh what a sacrifice you guys did for us and he is just turned 50 and they do not have any kids and he says well i do not know how you did it well for one thing they probably did a lot of sacrificing and when you sacrifice it makes you more humble 

Recording: (9131/ 9621)

Recording: (9138/ 9621) 
but the dispatch the only reason i get the dispatch is i do want to know what is going on locally 

Recording: (9139/ 9621) 
i think the latter i do not think will make any difference the kids that i know in junior high and in college it just does not make any difference to them and they do not like those classes they think they are boring they think it has no relevance to their life 

Recording: (9140/ 9621) 
personally no i do not think so

Recording: (9145/ 9621) 
yeah it is ridiculous plus it is a nationally recognized school so a degree from ohio state i mean you could go anywhere in the nation someone is at least going to recognize it because it is a big name ashland would be more of a sell i would be like okay it is small it is private it is accredited but still 

Recording: (9146/ 9621) 
yeah right 

Recording: (9147/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (9148/ 9621) 
and i did not even want you know and i knew my mom it is like if she can save a nickel somewhere you know she will so i knew that that is how they were and i did not want to you know it was my choice to get married it was my choice to have kids and you know i did not i did not feel the need to ask them well i think 

Recording: (9149/ 9621)

Recording: (9150/ 9621) 
yeah one is still in high school and she is ready to she wants to go on to college so she is pretty much ready to go i mean she is got one more year of high school but and i held her back in kindergarten so she is an older graduate she will be 19 when she graduates and then on the other hand graduated when she was 17 so then my youngest daughter amy she is she is doing real well i mean she is getting really good grades a is and b is and with she had kind of a hard time in high school she was raped by a teacher in ninth grade when she first went into a school and from there it is just been a nightmare of what how that it is affected her know anything she goes through you blame it on that or you go back and say oh i wonder you know if she was like that because of this and you know so that is been a real struggle in high school i was i never really was that excited about it for her because the memories she has she went on to a different school and she met a lot of good people there and she 

Recording: (9151/ 9621) 
wow 

Recording: (9152/ 9621)

Recording: (9160/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9161/ 9621) 
eh 

Recording: (9162/ 9621) 
um actually oddly enough that is what i am putting in 

Recording: (9163/ 9621) 
oh i know it i know it that is really what is hard 

Recording: (9164/ 9621) 
i am not 

Recording: (9165/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9166/ 9621) 
yeah i would do that 

Recording: (9167/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (9168/ 9621) 
yeah if they want if they you know choose i am sure there is you know women that are lesbians that have been with men also you know they have been with a man and then they have been with a woman now now they got a girlfriend so obviously you know and i feel like that was because they had an attraction towards a woman so now they think they are lesbian i do not see i do not that is why i think so i do not think that but if that is their choice that is their choice so i do think they could change 

Recording: (9169/ 9621) 
totally like the directions and the homework and everything is all 100 in german 

Recording: (9170/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (9171/ 9621) 
i do 

Recording: (9172/ 9621) 
actually kauai yeah so it was really nice i thought of course i did not go to all of them but it was nice 

Recording: (9173/ 9621) 
so to that end we have a designated friday evening date night sherry usually tries to get all of saturday and all of sunday as date night as well so we are like an extended weekend thing 

Recording: (9174/ 9621) 
not really but i think living in the bible belt as she did she was living there 10 years before she married and got involved in a youth group and i think that that was very influential on her decision and so she was not married in the church all my other children were but you know she is she is going her own path and that is fine with me she is a very good girl she is very conscientious and 

Recording: (9175/ 9621) 
we teach english to little kids or help clean or work at libraries or different things 

Recording: (9176/ 9621) 
yeah it is 

Recording: (9177/ 9621) 
they go out there and there was a i suppose a county seat town and they file a claim on a certain area of land it was surveyed off and marked off in sections a section of land is 640 acres that sounds like a lot of it is a good sized area 

Recording: (9178/ 9621) 
have you really have you gone to see all the shows 

Recording: (9179/ 9621) 
and then we would go do what we wanted to do 

Recording: (9180/ 9621) 
and you know i just really think they need to make that an option for a young girl i really do because there is just too many unwanted children there just is and that really bothers me that we do not have another option like another country we are a lot more right wing here in america but i just feel that is got to be an option for these young girls it just really does 

Recording: (9181/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9182/ 9621) 
chances or chance it whatever from molly female so that was her name from molly she thought boy they are nice in this country they even named my baby for me people are so stupid 

Recording: (9183/ 9621) 
we got divorced in 88 

Recording: (9184/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (9185/ 9621) 
hmm 

Recording: (9186/ 9621) 
and they leave and you get either another asshole or somebody good you just wait until you get somebody good 

Recording: (9187/ 9621) 
and then the people that enjoy you think why are we hiring these guys what are they thinking 

Recording: (9188/ 9621) 
i blame it on that yeah because you know there is been a lot more kids that have died in school than you know just recently i guess it was not in the big numbers at one time but there is been random violence in schools you know where kids have died even more than you know seven or whatever and i think that the media has just made it into something that have glamorized it and some of the kids i think they are screwed up anyway and they are just like well hey you know i can do that and i will be on the yeah i do i think that is a big part of that because they want their name known and they do not care if they die anyway 

Recording: (9189/ 9621) 
actually they are working on it i am sorry i did not mean to interrupt you they have just instated some bonus schemes where as the poverty level i think is considered 13000 pounds a year and if you are below the poverty level and you do go back to work you get a certain extra bonus beyond so there is a bonus for back to work you mentioned earlier about how this would affect the children with this twoyear welfare thing i mean at least i know a lot more about the system there for whatever reason than i do about the system here which is kind of unfortunate but there i mean i do not really think in a lot of situations of course i am sure there are people who follow it as it should be and who really need it and who are really taking care of their children but unfortunately you do not really see that side very much you see the people who like their kids see none of that money they are left at home by themselves if they can even get them to school if they even go to school if they are even bothered and there are documentaries on all the time there so you really sort of it is more in your face than it is here that i ever noticed but i do think and with that they have specific programs for the children and i think one of the problems too with the schools is the fact that if a kid has bad behavior or bad attendance that you send them home i mean i think that is the most ridiculous thing like surely that is not a punishment for a lot of these kids and you know at least in england on these things i have seen you know they send them home and these kids are just doing whatever going around the neighborhood shoplifting bullying you know hot wiring cars at the age of you know 10 or something and i do not know i think i do have sort of very strong opinions about people who are having all these kids and do not take care of them at all 

Recording: (9190/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9191/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (9192/ 9621) 
and i do not like sitting in an office 

Recording: (9193/ 9621) 
because the therapist did it yeah 

Recording: (9194/ 9621) 
yeah um i have grown up here all my life so it really has not shocked me all that much 

Recording: (9195/ 9621)

Recording: (9198/ 9621) 
and when i started as an apprentice in the shop they said well we will start you at a dollar an hour i thought that sounded pretty good you know in 1945 the fall of 1945 so then as things worked out in washington dc they came out with the gli bill of rights we found out that that would apply to apprentices too

as a result of the one trying to force myself back into what to do so i mean yeah when you come down to these things there is people with mental illness and with a disability are trying to pawn off the responsibility onto everybody but themselves you know well the medical doctors if they would have seen this guy and given him medication he would not have went out there and killed somebody shoulda woulda coulda man if the guy stopped taking his medication of his own free will that was his responsibility to take that medicine every day just like it is mine to take mine every day and when i stopped taking mine that was my responsibility which is why i do not want to go to the legal system to try and make an excuse even though there is some law that protects people that if they were drunk or on the influence of medication or off the influence of medication in case they bought a house or signed into some kind of contract that they would not be liable

it might i mean good teachers do that i still get upset when i was teaching school i did activitybased teaching and i was doing some volunteer work at dublin schools which is supposed to be one of the better schools in the area and i thought there would be all sorts of creative things going on and there was not it was still read the chapter write the answers to the questions at the end of the book and i thought how boring i mean there are different ways to get kids turned on to things i am not sure there is so much influence from the media and i say media broad based be it print media or tv that has this culture today of stars and media phenomenons and they do not see the relevance and i do not think they hear from their parents like i did the importance of voting and that is where it comes from their parents do not vote so if their parents do not vote they are not again i do not know what the the answer is but it is very scary what is going to happen in the next couple of generations the only good thought for me as i think about this is that i will not be here to see the disintegration of the democracy although i have great faith too i have great faith in democracy there are always good people that somehow come up and i think if there were an issue i think kids would get if there were kids in college that were being drafted and being sent to die in a war that people did not think was important or had no real relevance to their lives i mean i think the kids would rally immediately the issue right now is that there is nothing there 

Recording: (9224/ 9621)

his mother died the week after we got married she had diabetes juvenile diabetes diagnosed at age 11 and just over the years ended up having open heart surgery and did not make it through the surgery my grandmother also died during open heart surgery so my perception of open heart surgery even though i am a nurse it is not very good just because of the two 

Recording: (9234/ 9621) 
i certainly would not and would i expect my mom to stay with that in that kind of a situation no way i would want her to be happy and i would want my dad to be happy also so ultimately for that situation i think it was much better they got married kind of young too and i think that maybe just jumping into a situation you need to be a little bit more careful i know that now it is a lot different than it used to be people would get married and they would just be expected to stay together and there is a lot of people that have been married for a really long time and they are miserable 

Recording: (9235/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9236/ 9621)

Recording: (9251/ 9621) 
right right but during the rest of the year a lot of times we will play really really challenging and interesting band music and you do not always get the opportunity to do that in musical groups sometimes they just sort of cater to the lowest common denominator of what they expect the audience to want to hear 

Recording: (9252/ 9621) 
you know because i just think it looks so awful when you can not even admit to what your opinion is 

Recording: (9253/ 9621)

Recording: (9263/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (9264/ 9621) 
but people coming from other cities like chicago new york and places like that where they were treated poorly by whites they tended to act differently towards you and everything until they realized that you were not like that we only had one racial incident when i was in the service where we were a predominantly white platoon and because we worked in missiles and stuff you know so then the security cops were above us and they were predominantly black you know and i do not know what happened something happened one time there was only like 20 people in our whole platoon and it was all in the same barracks and some guy said something offcolor to one of them or something like that you know and it got kind of out of hand for a while but you know thank god nothing really happened 

Recording: (9265/ 9621)

Recording: (9269/ 9621) 
all right 

Recording: (9270/ 9621) 
or that are having kids and i mean we talk about that is all we do is sit in there and talk about our kids and what they are doing and how our parents and them reacted like there was this girl that just got in there today and her parents were like flipping out because she is pregnant and we were all telling her about how you know it always starts out that way and they will ease up later on 

Recording: (9271/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (9272/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (9273/ 9621) 
i know 

Recording: (9274/ 9621) 
at that time in the 30s 

Recording: (9275/ 9621) 
do you want this donor to be this this and that some people will say that i feel sorry for those people i pray for those people because prayer is the most powerful thing you can have it is gonna get you through nothing else i do not care what challenge you have in front of you you put in his hands and you have enough faith to practice it it will come through it may not come through the way you think you want it to but somewhere along the line you are gonna say ah for some reason i am supposed to do this i can not explain it but you are always looking for reasons you are asking me i am looking for reasons but a lot of times you can not give a reason it just happens why did you marry your husband how did you meet your husband how did he come about how did the passing go to explain that to your offspring someday 

Recording: (9276/ 9621) 
to help him 

Recording: (9277/ 9621) 
those are as i think you were implying those are needs to those people but they are not so how do we correct some of this i think we have got to cut out a lot of this luxury we have got to slowly bring quote the family back home and i do not necessarily say it has to be the woman versus the man who cares in today is work we are far less agriculturally related we are more in service orientation and manufacturing orientation so a man or let me rephrase that a woman can do most of the work that is being done outside of the home today versus what they could have done as agricultural people and so once again though that would bring people back to this central family makeup just has to be communications communications as it is going it is irreversible i think it can be redirected in much in the manner she is speaking and where does this start i think it has to start back here in first grade i think parents must participate with teachers as we used to it was just common you could walk in and sit down and watch the students or participate and or assist today they have these assistants but they are hired directed they are not in there portraying or passing their own their values of the community to the students so i think that is i guess i come i will continue to come back to family to family almost everything has got to be come to family bring that family back together and get them to communicate on that personal basis not that impersonal basis 

Recording: (9278/ 9621) 
because they are saying you are still a kid but yet 

Recording: (9279/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (9280/ 9621)

Recording: (9290/ 9621) 
i think if you are open enough with your children these parents and say you know we want to give you this option we prefer you do not do this but if you decide to do it we want you to be protected 

Recording: (9291/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9292/ 9621)

Recording: (9297/ 9621) 
so hard i mean every summer they have homework that has to be done or else the first grading period is an f and when my oldest daughter went to northland first because she thought about being a teacher and they had a teaching academy there and once she got into it she went oh maybe not so i said well you know whatever so then she wanted to go to because it is basically a columbus public school that is geared to college only i mean if if you are not going to college do not go there because you will flunk out it is very hard and she got in the second year three weeks before school started and so we go over there and they hand her this stack of material that is got to be done in three weeks so i thought well i will just call and i called and i talked to the principal and i said you know they gave all this stuff and you know everybody else has had june july august to get this done and she is got three weeks and she goes and the principal goes that is correct and i go well there is no way she can get this done and i said you know everybody else has had all this time and she is going to get it done in three weeks and they go that is right so they take there is no excuses you know and it is very hard i know my youngest daughter who is just as smart as my oldest would do horrible there because you know basically they say we are talking about china this week and on december the 15th we want to report on why chinese people do what they do you know and it is like and every week they do not come by and go have you started have you started have you started do you have the outline right and it is up to you to go gosh i have to have an outline i have to have a bibliography i have to have the facts i have to interview some people and if you do not sit down with a little calendar and go this week i am getting this done this week i am getting this done this you just fail so my oldest daughter is pretty detail oriented so after we kind of helped her start you know and say you know you are you are going to have to do these things so you get this done i said and basically get it done like two weeks before it is done so then you can say oh this is not very good and amend it or whatever or help somebody get somebody with typing or whatever so she is really good and it is helped her at school a lot because i know she toured here here to ohio state and there were some people here that would come from cause and they go this will be easier than your high school 

Recording: (9298/ 9621) 
i am like i do not remember that 

Recording: (9299/ 9621) 
i know it 

Recording: (9300/ 9621) 
you are like no he is back there trying to shoot me you know i remember hearing horror stories you know about people just dying you know left and right just like you know just dropping just to get out of east germany and they do not play they do shoot to kill and just now just to walk back and forth it is amazing 

Recording: (9301/ 9621)

Recording: (9302/ 9621) 
we had one of the parties up there and they had this big pyramid shaped thing i forget what they call it it is like a crystal or something i do not know but they have a speaker hook up to it and the structure of it makes the sound resonate like crazy they have subwoofers sitting under it and there is this bed in the middle so i ended up falling asleep there one night somebody woke me up with the music 

Recording: (9303/ 9621) 
she there is our wanderlust right there she travels all the time 

Recording: (9304/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (9305/ 9621) 
how to do it so i think that would probably be about the biggest difference is just really the amount of education you get 

Recording: (9306/ 9621) 
you can not especially with kids it is just too overwhelming 

Recording: (9307/ 9621) 
really why just because it is close to japan 

Recording: (9308/ 9621) 
i was more comfortable here than in high school you do not see like the big cliques like the popular abercrombie wearing people or like all the art students hanging out together it is a big mix of people and everyone is doing their own thing 

Recording: (9309/ 9621) 
well i am very much in favor of gun control very strong gun control they just seem to be too available i have done some of the things that the schools are doing about it the kid who comes to school with a paper gun gets suspended that is a little much but 

Recording: (9310/ 9621) 
i think that is great i think obviously there is always a downside but i think that too many people abuse the system and unfortunately it is very hard when then it ruins it for the people who really do need it but as long as they have created a system whereby it will not be obviously as good for those people as it has been the ones who are genuinely unemployable but i think depending on how sort of focused they are on the individuals in their area or whatever however it is divided up i do not know hopefully not special treatment but obviously you would try to steer them more in whichever direction they are most suited for as far as maybe like far as maybe like the volunteer work because i mean you know there is so much volunteering to be done everywhere and even if you do not have you know if you are lacking in whatever way you think that you can you know there is something you know hopefully that i do not know 

Recording: (9311/ 9621)

Recording: (9317/ 9621) 
what i do not understand is with the construction they start everywhere you would think that you would start one area you put a whole bunch of people and they would work real fast and they would get that done and then they would move on but it is like every single place in the city is got like four guys working and you think what the hell are you doing over there

cumulonimbus or whatever you know and you know he was pretty much pissed off the rest of the way up there because i was right 

Recording: (9342/ 9621) 
my answer to your question is has this eroded i am going to answer using the word respect yes i feel that this has eroded over time there is not the respect for our elders i do not necessarily mean elders in terms of the chronological age but i am talking in terms of generations there is less respect for the father less respect for the mother less respect for the grandparents and the greatgrandparents i am going to give you a firsthand example i just had a conversation with one of my granddaughters who is now 20 she will come over to my house grandpa is house and she will come in and she will flop down in a chair and she will do nothing in that household even if you suggest it i do not ever tell her to do things and i have pointed out to her that whenever we went to visit grandpa or great grandfather if we saw weeds out in the garden we went out and we hoed the garden if the chicken house needed to be cleaned and they had not gotten to it that day we went out and cleaned the chicken house we would say grandpa is it okay if we go out and clean your chicken house well of course you knew very well it was gonna be okay but a matter of respect though you ask is it okay for us to do it and now with her i can have dishes out there in the sink that are left there from breakfast and maybe lunch and she will walk out there and i will say well grandpa how come your dishes are not done and then she turns around and walks away you are looking for something to eat you know that is right and she may then go ahead and say well sometimes she will ask sometimes she does not but let us assume she did she asked is it all right if i have some of this she goes ahead and gets the dishes out and so forth she puts them right in there in that sink with those other dishes makes no efforts to clean them and i have seen this in many many many incidents but i am giving you this is very firsthand i know this and i strongly suspect that this is a typical typical thing in our society today so yes in my opinion definitely it is eroding i know you took a little different approach in answering the question from over the time that this kind of thing is eroding based upon the word respect i i will expect you to be able to know what to do but i mean i never did and i know well i will not give you any examples but anyway if i told them they could not do it i would try them swearing is one of my bad habits and i know that i would try very very hard i got taught one time that i better watch a little more carefully by my own little girl but anyway i would always and i would apologize if they did catch me doing something i would be telling them no you can not do that i i mean now if you want to hear the story funny well the tv just sees that i was baking a pie and i was taking this pie out of the oven it was a cherry pie or an apple pie well it was getting juicy sometimes and i had not put any aluminum foil in there either to catch it and just as i started to get it out i spilled it and i said a bad word you know and just as i said that word leaning down here there is two little shoes and i just sit there for a minute before i take it out i take it on out sit on top of the line i said well mommy said a bad word i guess that mommy has to have soap on her feet i yep so i go to the bathroom i thought i always told you to tell the kids to stick your tongue out and i just put a little bit of soap on the end of their tongue well now i have been i have had false teeth since i was about 32 needless to say i had false teeth when this kid did this you were not five years old go in the bathroom i sit down on that toilet stool and i sit there i stick out my tongue she takes that cake of soap she does not rub my tongue she twists it takes off my teeth and she does not always use the teeth two weeks get that soap taste off my teeth no matter how i scrub need many older folks right now i do not think because of two people have to work outside the house she just used the word penalty government people and everybody that is let us come back to about the middle i am concerned that we are getting away from penalties completely and i feel it is absolutely essential that we have penalties we have for everyone for everyone really across the board we are getting away from penalties we are getting away from penalties but so many people just to give an example talking about adults i just read a statistic the other day right here city of columbus where there was an extremely high percent i can not quote the percentages of people who ignore yellow lights and of consequence they are ending up going through red lights and there are many many many accidents taking place and it used to be that you could place a law enforcement officer at the corner if it happened he immediately would penalize you by giving your ticket and you face the court as the case may be well now we have passed so many little ordinances and laws and changed the enforcement policies and this kind of thing with a poor police officer he can not even do that any longer he is got if somebody runs through a red light you almost have to hit somebody and then be accused for going through the red light he can not just arbitrarily be there because that is called i think the word harassment plays a part you are harassing that individual because you are standing there waiting for him to commit this problem let is just get away from that example you can talk about whether you were carrying i do not want to get into the guns and knives and stuff in the school 

Recording: (9343/ 9621) 
yeah i think a lot of times people are not real rational as far as who they go for 

Recording: (9344/ 9621) 
it was okay to put up with my trying to learn how to be a parent in exchange for having me all to herself 

Recording: (9345/ 9621) 
not at all 

Recording: (9346/ 9621) 
their ids i mean the guys are trying to look older the girls are trying to look younger 

Recording: (9347/ 9621) 
i think because of the movies and i think of nintendo and all those games that they have on there i think that really does spark things in little children is minds and even you know like in junior high that oh yeah we could do that you know and there is just so much violence and when we were growing up there was not any violence on tv we were allowed to watch it but you know what i mean i mean the comics were not violent now it is too open for kids they say the parents should monitor them 

Recording: (9348/ 9621) 
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah 

Recording: (9349/ 9621) 
and from downstairs we broke into my computer 

Recording: (9350/ 9621) 
they just i am not sure really what they do 

Recording: (9351/ 9621) 
i do not know 

Recording: (9352/ 9621) 
yeah my kids were both two weeks late so i know how that is 

Recording: (9353/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (9354/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (9355/ 9621) 
it is kind of a neat place is not it 

Recording: (9356/ 9621) 
i guess so i hope that they can keep the school somehow for kids but it will not be him running it 

Recording: (9357/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9358/ 9621) 
mmhmm here 

Recording: (9359/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9360/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9361/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (9362/ 9621) 
somebody must have been watching over me 

Recording: (9363/ 9621) 
anybody see this 

Recording: (9364/ 9621) 
exactly 

Recording: (9365/ 9621) 
there is a lot of i do not know how the training is done with some of these animals some of them are treated very cruelly 

Recording: (9366/ 9621) 
i have not seen any fights i have not seen anyone get shot i mean you read about it in the lantern but the only thing that i was really shocked about was the people begging on high street 

Recording: (9367/ 9621) 
no it was just the usual things she touched my things because they were far apart enough they had their own social groups they had their own friends and interests so there was not much of that but it was the usual you know she is breathing on me in the car he is humming too loud i do not know if you have got brothers and sisters but yeah you have probably went through it all yeah well there were five of us and a lot of that 

Recording: (9368/ 9621) 
but you know what i mean he was about nine years old but he is known me all my life so you know what i mean it was not no big shock 

Recording: (9369/ 9621) 
heh 

Recording: (9370/ 9621) 
that they fired him like that the night before the michigan game so then the next day he came out on the field with a black suit and a fedora you know a hat he looked so cool you know because joe paterno he always wears a tie i do not know he just he is a great coach 

Recording: (9371/ 9621) 
yeah and this is something i have thought about a lot because if i had stayed in cincinnati say where it is very conservative you know not real open to new things or if i had stayed on the east coast where of course it would be really competitive i probably would not be working as a freelancer today i came to columbus there was not you know there was not much going on when i came here 

Recording: (9372/ 9621) 
oh really 

Recording: (9373/ 9621) 
yeah it is she does not even drive to work 

Recording: (9374/ 9621) 
and we were stopped at one of their defensive lines 

Recording: (9375/ 9621) 
but then you will have to have people running the machinery and checking the machinery 

Recording: (9376/ 9621) 
you know we will go places you know 

Recording: (9377/ 9621) 
i am not that old yet i might look it 

Recording: (9378/ 9621) 
they do not have rabies 

Recording: (9379/ 9621) 
yeah yeah yeah it surprises me to find that columbus is so out of shape but i am in the well you know in the circles that i move in everybody is middleaged and they all quit smoking and they are all of a sudden trying to beat off the reaper and so you know i mean well and of course they were always hippies and ate sprouts and twigs and leaves anyway you know so that is the sort of circles i move in but i know because i have these parttime jobs from time to time i see a whole different group of people and i can say it is probably true 

Recording: (9380/ 9621) 
hmm 

Recording: (9381/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (9382/ 9621) 
just 

Recording: (9383/ 9621) 
so once you convince people that there is nothing to be scared of here and there is nothing to be scared of there then they start to play and once you start playing you start learning 

Recording: (9384/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9385/ 9621) 
and much and much other things you know that i am coming to understand 

Recording: (9386/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (9387/ 9621) 
we did not know anything about what he did we found out more after he died 

Recording: (9388/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9389/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (9390/ 9621) 
yeah yeah that is another thing i hear about that 

Recording: (9391/ 9621) 
you know they never ask for extra money and they had to cut back on everything and i think it just set people back now we are trying real hard to catch up and at some point we are going to have to put a levy on again and who knows what is happened we are keeping rosa smith right now because she is so good pr with the business community but the business community in columbus does not really support the schools they do not i mean we have got two new stadiums and we have not got any increase in school funding 

Recording: (9392/ 9621) 
yeah but my oldest she is the oldest she is got three kids one her oldest is by a different guy and her new husband adopted her cause she never sees him and then they got two other girls and they live together they got a house they are going through marriage they have been together for like five years and they are not doing very well right now but hopefully they will get over that and then i got an older brother who him and his girlfriend moved in together and they just had a baby 

Recording: (9393/ 9621) 
so they i have osu insurance but i had no doctor at the time and they wanted to admit me they told me they were going to make me wait two months before they did anything and what i did i had my wife drive me down to the hospital and i crawled out of the car and crawled into the hospital until they either admit me or i crawl out the door 

Recording: (9394/ 9621) 
yeah and it is been five years this year that we have been married and close to seven that i have known him so and it is still just as exciting it is still just as good and he amazes me every day because i am i am one oh this will not last forever but you know and he is like well when we are 90 you know you will know so 

Recording: (9395/ 9621) 
so he finally decided you know after oh well when he was in catholic school they kept his desk in the hallway you know 

Recording: (9396/ 9621) 
so what do you do if i do not know what to believe about something i will go and i will find an answer for myself i am not going to take somebody else is answer and if i do take someone else people who do but i know a lot of people who do not do the theological discussions no no unless you are seeking that out i mean i go to the vineyard church it is up in westerville and there is about probably 6000 of us it is one of the biggest churches in ohio if you want to find something in that church you can find it you can find a discussion group about anything it is just a matter of finding it within any denomination or within any religion you go as deep as you want to go there are people who just go on sunday mornings there are people who just go on easter there are people who go monday wednesday tuesday and sunday nights and saturday nights and are of bible understanding what do are a lot of churches who have totally forgotten that that is what the original that is what a christian is supposed to do and that is what our church does 

Recording: (9397/ 9621) 
wow 

Recording: (9398/ 9621) 
and that is actually a really interesting thing too because especially coming back you know and moving all my stuff out of storage i have just been on this you know i am getting rid of half of everything i own because over there it is you know it just feels so weird to come back and i feel so loaded down especially when i have spent so much time just living out of a suitcase you know i just really realize i have so much stuff that i do not need because there you know everyone has just sort little closet with clothes there is not stuff all around everything is more expensive so everyone has a lot less and here it is like everything is so relatively inexpensive that it is like picture frames or something there it might be $25 for one so you buy one here oh they are $5 a piece let us buy five 

Recording: (9399/ 9621) 
and that is what i am saying atoning for sins it is quite a hypocrisy when you get a church telling you that you need to ask for forgiveness when what they did i mean in the church in zanesville where i went and buried my grandparents and went through all my life over the door of the church was a picture of christopher columbus with a missionary a priest and all his men with his sword drawn a dead native american at his feet and three more at the side looking on in fear now i ask the priest a cold hard question 

Recording: (9400/ 9621) 
i get wick that is it 

Recording: (9401/ 9621) 
so i had some family responsibilities we were always my brother and i and my sisters were active in the 4h clubs 

Recording: (9402/ 9621) 
huh 

Recording: (9403/ 9621) 
that is awesome there is a lot of stuff to do down there if you like outdoors i bet 

Recording: (9404/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (9405/ 9621) 
the university never has money that is like me when i first came here the university was not paying me nothing i worked two jobs for 10 years while i was here the first 10 years just to make a living 

Recording: (9406/ 9621) 
and he did that too 

Recording: (9407/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (9408/ 9621) 
simply because it is not too much of a change from the status quo 

Recording: (9409/ 9621) 
and like even the people the maybe their apartments did not look as impressive but they were making money 

Recording: (9410/ 9621) 
hehe 

Recording: (9411/ 9621)

Recording: (9412/ 9621) 
the life 

Recording: (9413/ 9621)

see you tomorrow i mean hold them feel the warmth of the body hear the conversation quietly rather than hearing ok time to get out of here you know with a vigorous thing but a pleasant sort of remark these kind i could elaborate i could write a whole book on that on this on the answer to your questions but it is these kinds of things are very elementary really they are very elementary i guess to our rage group but maybe not so sure that maybe the baby boomers that would not be elementary at all going back to your question about the baby boomers i still think they were i do not think they are causing it about that i think it was a happenstance with that group but it is a massive group very 

Recording: (9424/ 9621) 
ugh 

Recording: (9425/ 9621) 
oh i think that is good 

Recording: (9426/ 9621) 
i can see that like i said for me i kind of stay where i am it is not that i really travel out into some of those other areas more it does not really affect me personally maybe that is bad i do not know maybe i should feel guilty about that 

Recording: (9427/ 9621) 
that is all i understand is money 

Recording: (9428/ 9621) 
my thesis is on the sudeten germans those are the germans who lived in czechoslovakia before the second world war and specifically i am looking at how they perceived their condition switching from being part of the austrohungarian empire and the germans being sort of the majority even though they were not the majority but sort of the master nation within the austrohungarian empire to becoming a minority within czechoslovakia 

Recording: (9429/ 9621)

Recording: (9437/ 9621) 
my mom teaches there so it is free tuition i get a tuition waiver 

Recording: (9438/ 9621) 
you know that is a possibility you are not supposed to carry that much money around and it is as much to protect the people after you as it is to protect you because the word has to get out that we do not have that much money it does not pay yeah 

Recording: (9439/ 9621) 
you know always something going on 

Recording: (9440/ 9621) 
personally i think it is too late because they can get things on the internet you know there is just so many things so many avenues for them to find violence and pornography and you know things that we you know when i was growing up we just there was no way i could see any of that stuff i had good parents but i was into you know lassie and tom and jer i mean you know these but you know they were not violent and they made you feel good after you watched them but i just think i do not think it could turn back right now i do not know 

Recording: (9441/ 9621) 
no the lifestyle was very easy to fit into and i have always been interested in sort of like to the whole european culture before i went there but i think the most difficult was actually because i was studying english when i went there and studying english here is a dime a dozen and studying english in england is sort of i do not know more sort of elitist which i did not realize before i got there so i was in all these courses i was the only american the classes were really small and i definitely got a feeling and there were a few classes that really stood out where there was sort of i would have to say something or i would have to give a presentation or something and it was sort of like what does this american know that was the hardest thing is the way i was treated by some of my peers in classes i mean not directly they would never say anything terrible to you or anything but it was just sort of that feeling of 

Recording: (9442/ 9621)

he does and his music is extremely good he taught himself by 16 he is playing eight instruments very well and he can not do that now where he lives he lives with this is another thing that boggles my mind his girlfriend is mother he is afraid his girlfriend her daughter was going to run away so she lets them sleep together in their house when her daughter was 14 

Recording: (9450/ 9621) 
when he was one just for one minute my mother taught me that i do not stand him in the corner 

Recording: (9451/ 9621) 
that is huge 

Recording: (9452/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (9453/ 9621) 
but i want them to do that to me and i think if you could teach your kids that and get back to teaching them the same thing on those radio programs and tv programs instead of what they are showing right now i think the world would be a lot of place a lot better place and long to the politicians if they stop saying now what is really best for the general public instead of what we think to make ourselves look great 

Recording: (9454/ 9621) 
there is lots of theater and the third thing would be we got restaurants 

Recording: (9455/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9456/ 9621) 
well i can tell you some community bands that could use ya oh really yeah 

Recording: (9457/ 9621) 
i am retired 

Recording: (9458/ 9621) 
yeah i mean it is like it is known but it is in a different way it is like a different type of fame than like traditional style so it is like more of like a respect as opposed to like an admiration type thing like like it is more of like a it is not like an mtv type thing you know 

Recording: (9459/ 9621) 
and he was the assistant manager of a video game store i worked at in high school 

Recording: (9460/ 9621) 
she is wonderful but back then they were it was the 60s and they were hippies and you know my mom is got long jet black hair and they are wearing their army outfits and whatever you know everybody is got bell bottoms my dad is got long hair down to here and everything so they lived like 17th avenue for a while and we lived like i said on summit until i was about three years old and then they split up for a little bit and got back together and my mom and i lived someplace on campus in just a little one room apartment it was just she and i and i would go see my dad on the weekends which was great for me i mean everybody my dad and i would do fun stuff my mom and i would do fun stuff and i never remember it being negative 

Recording: (9461/ 9621) 
i definitely i mean i think i went to like kindergarten in a public school so i do not really know too much about like the kind of curriculums and things that they had to do but i know i mean as far as going to a lot of the stuff like in math and things like that that i am doing now is stuff i already covered in high school so i already have a basis for it 

Recording: (9462/ 9621) 
yeah that is what it seems i mean i know it is like i mean it is the same proportion i mean there are more old people there but it just seems more apparent just because of how but you can not like go outside all the time yeah i mean there is never like three or four months where you just want to sit in your house and 

Recording: (9463/ 9621) 
you know it is like look you always think i could you know look i am doing really well look how wonderful everything is 

Recording: (9464/ 9621) 
i think the news media have hyped it up too much really i mean we have an accord with cuba that says anyone that is trying to escape from cuba to the united states that is found at sea is immediately returned to cuba whether you agree with it or not that is the accord and that is what castro is that is the premise he is operating on and the news media they have not really been they just have not been real objective about it i mean you know like there are two fishermen that found him at sea you never hear about the other one because this was on one just briefly i heard on the news because he thinks he should go back to his father but you do not hear about him there is three cousins two of them think he should stay in miami the other one thinks he should go back with his father you do not hear about him i was reading about him in newsweek or someplace so i think the news media has not been totally objective about this 

Recording: (9465/ 9621) 
you know stuff like that it is kind of neat because you do not have to pay well you have to pay for it but like magazines 

Recording: (9466/ 9621) 
but we still need to have property management records that is very essential and a lot of times when you are talking to engineers they do not realize that part of it they do not like the detail at least that aspect of it but we need to have a lot of that because you need to know how your facilities are structured the time history any type of activity on that whether it is been installed removed relocated wherever it might be but we need to know that how it has an impact upon the design of a particular facility voice and data 

Recording: (9467/ 9621) 
yeah i mean like it just it provides a window of opportunity for those who really do work like 

Recording: (9468/ 9621) 
three years i have them usually i have them sixth seventh and eighth for those language arts subjects unless they get some miraculous cure and they get phased out like right now i am phasing an eighth grader out and into the regular english but he worked really really hard and he is very bright and he is still a terrible speller but he is not lazy and he does his assignments and as long as you clearly explain to him what he is supposed to do and he is a good writer and usually when he misspells something you can figure out what it says from the context you know so we are in the process of phasing him out so that he will not have to he is had help i think since he was in kindergarten that is the other thing that is really an enigma about these kids 90 of the time their iq is like 115 to 130 i mean they are very bright but yet something is not 

Recording: (9469/ 9621) 
i know the way we dressed and everything was kind of appalling to the parents and everything i guess maybe that is where i am coming from the way some of the kids dress retro back to with the bell bottoms and everything to us the piercings i just can not get into that and some of the girls i mean they you know i mean my guy they 14 6 15 years old they look like they are 20some years old you know and that is what they want to look like plus you watch some of these stupid shows on tv you know and you sit there and go man i could not my daughter do not do that you know when she is around me now when she is away from me i do not know what the hell she does

there is you know just i had three spiritual leaders tell me that a great gift came with that that there was it was no accident it was supposed to happen and there is a word called synchronicity 

Recording: (9474/ 9621) 
well and especially in my situation you know i think about it quite a bit you know if i would have had more of an opportunity to have a oneonone relationship with her i probably being a girl you know could have probably helped her out in a lot of social things you know about men because i kind of get the impression that she do not really she still ai not very interested in men you know so which is her thing you know so 

Recording: (9475/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (9476/ 9621) 
just let people make their own mistakes but do not make me pay for it 

Recording: (9477/ 9621) 
like mostly because we had time but if you had time and money you would be able to do the tourist things 

Recording: (9478/ 9621) 
oh yeah i was never going to get married again i had my house my kids i had already done that i was financially secure and i was not even looking one of my best friends though at the time she saw this guy he was the roommate of a guy she was seeing and i talked to this girl every day and she was like oh you have to meet him you have to meet him i was like oh call me tomorrow i do not want to meet anybody so it took a long time for us to be introduced but then as soon as we were she was right i mean we were like inseparable from probably two weeks after we met we just i have not been without him so

Recording: (9508/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9509/ 9621) 
i just go back and copycat something she said picking up that child and cuddling it and having that baby touch your skin and teaching what love is you do not necessarily teach love by words but just by the feel that child will begin to love you as the father or the mother or the brother little brother and the little sister all of those now you say teach that well my god did not they know that when they first came into this classroom no not today not today i dare say that the vast majority and i mean above 50 well above 50 when i say that i am not being arbitrary students in high school today probably have not had their mother or their father truly hold them and hug them rather than just saying hi johnny bye 

Recording: (9510/ 9621) 
das ist gut 

Recording: (9511/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (9512/ 9621) 
you are talking to people all over the country i mean you are becoming more diversified because you get thoughts and opinions from people from all across the world 

Recording: (9513/ 9621) 
the lawyers the judges everybody that works in that system i do not care who they are there is not an honest one in it i do not care there is not an honest one in it they might think they are but once you expose yourself to corruption you take that in with you

i mean that probably could not be proven i do not know if anybody would do any decent studies on it i just bet you a million dollars that it would be the influence of tv and then another thing well tv is where it comes from but the kids are all into pokemon right now 

Recording: (9520/ 9621) 
yeah i have been here pretty much all my life until just recent weeks when i moved up to delaware it is a real comfort for me because everybody pretty much around where we used to live just you know it gets worse and worse 

Recording: (9521/ 9621) 
yeah go in there and find out you know is the kid being abused if the kid is being abused you know take them out you know forget the parents rights you know or you know if they are using drugs put them somewhere you know and get them you know get them in rehab you know and keep them there you know just do not throw them there for three days and then throw them out it is a lot of money being wasted on these kids being placed in these foster homes where nothing is getting accomplished

Recording: (9524/ 9621) 
i am going to be a teacher going into business for myself i need something to sell and selling my own time does not actually seem to be a worthwhile endeavor i have done it i have already done independent consulting i set up a contract and said hi you pay me i will do this thing and i go do that thing and you make a lot of money like that the problem is you get taxed obscenely like that because you do not have an employer paying half your taxes for you and there is other bunches of overhead involved and there is the constant cycle of marketing oneself and it all depends on how much you want to market yourself marketing yourself is easier for some people than for others and it is more fun for some people than for others so so far i do not know if i 

Recording: (9525/ 9621) 
that whole thing 

Recording: (9526/ 9621)

Recording: (9534/ 9621)

Recording: (9537/ 9621) 
but and the parent left it in the top drawer of a tool shed that was locked and the kid knew where the key was he climbed up on a ladder unlocked it and he ended up shooting himself with it i mean as far as that goes there is really nothing more he can do 

Recording: (9538/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (9539/ 9621) 
projects were right from infancy where i was designing the project first of all we had to find out what we had with the vesture as everyone should know even as a residential user you have to know what you have in your house the telephone company does not provide the service to you anymore we had to know what we had throughout the state of ohio and some 88 counties and wherever else the number of facilities we had so we went on a scavenger hunt 

Recording: (9540/ 9621) 
the lack of discipline at the home 

Recording: (9541/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (9542/ 9621) 
right well that is something i have noticed in the local news particularly lately they say exclusively on our channel and stuff and it is usually not that big of a deal what they are talking about but they are making a big point that you heard it here first i mean if you hear it five minutes earlier on one station or another what difference does it make 

Recording: (9543/ 9621) 
but yeah i do not know yeah i think it is like there is like a real like either it is old people who are there retiring or whatever or it is more of like a younger people there i do not know you do not see a lot i do not know there is middleaged people there but it is not so apparent like it is here i guess 

Recording: (9544/ 9621) 
i mean it was a pretty good place i mean looking back on it i remember it a lot better than when i was actually there 

Recording: (9545/ 9621) 
yeah but 50 years ago if you had epilepsy they would lock you in a closet and throw away the key and would not let you out most of the parents i have seen to me i would rather see the kids with a stepparent 

Recording: (9546/ 9621)

Recording: (9556/ 9621) 
right well 

Recording: (9557/ 9621) 
right and you are not as close to your family and the traditions and i think you lose all of that and then you get so wrapped up in work and moving that i do not think kids have the center base to the family that they used to have and i do not know the culture is just so fast paced that i do not think people are maybe it is not honesty maybe it is just they do not have as much time to get attached and they are ready to move on again you just do not get as close to people as you used to 

Recording: (9558/ 9621) 
and people do not have big families like they used to 

Recording: (9559/ 9621) 
help them 

Recording: (9560/ 9621) 
that is just ridiculous too though but yeah to me that is really weird i do not like i said i do not know what they are thinking or what their thought process was but i am thinking maybe the social because a lot to me high school was real social 

Recording: (9561/ 9621) 
well that gets back to what you are saying almost in the family life hey what is a hat well you do not need a husband all you need is a sperm bank that is what you are saying are not you are not you 

Recording: (9562/ 9621) 
well i do not know how to explain that especially if anybody is going to listen to this i had a friend that taught classes human potential classes was very interested and participated very in depth in the human potential movement so a gentleman by the name of alexander everett who really is the father of the human potential movement moved out there and he was going to have a group of people work out there and he said that you know i was qualified well when we got out there it just fell through you know and we all just lived our lives but i was glad that you know that he got me out there because i adored it i just loved it out there 

Recording: (9563/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9564/ 9621) 
yeah thanks 

Recording: (9565/ 9621) 
i think in the case of tie it should be used but if there is a black woman who is very well qualified for a job and a white male who is equally qualified for the job the black woman should get it 

Recording: (9566/ 9621) 
thank you guys 

Recording: (9567/ 9621) 
谢谢 

Recording: (9568/ 9621) 
and the data they collect is just i mean there are some of those long forms that go into a lot of detail but the basic data essentially how many people live in the household what are their ages and race and that is it and that is not a i do not think that is a big secret myself 

Recording: (9569/ 9621)

Recording: (9577/ 9621)

Recording: (9578/ 9621) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (9579/ 9621) 
exactly 

Recording: (9580/ 9621) 
and then they physically died before they got a chance to live and when their spirit wakes up and finds out that they are physically dead and they can not do anything in a physical world anymore they want to draw themselves to especially if they were a bad person they want to draw them to the brightest thing 

Recording: (9581/ 9621) 
they think they should get paid and i happen to be the person to believe that if you live in his house you contribute your share you clean up your room you help with the dishes you take your plates from the table rinse them off and put them there by the sink you take turns doing the dishes if mom or somebody is busy and can not do it you help and you do your share around the home and you do not do it because you are going to get paid for it well daddy gets paid well yeah but daddy is the one that is supporting the household you know he is got to pay for all the utilities and the finances and the food we bring in and everything else but everybody else has got to help here to make the home and i think that that is one of the problems too many people think instead of just getting them to lovingly help each other because we are supposed to help each other and this goes all the way back to what i said you said beginning in school or kindergarten i think it begins from the time the baby is born and the mother takes time to sit down here and either nurse it or feed it a bottle and rock it and sing to it put it to bed and play with them and teach them things as they grow up teach them how to tie their shoes and take them off teach them how to do everything they are supposed to do and oh that reminds me of a joke i got to tell this maybe this is off the record but i read it in reader is digest the other day and it said about this little the mother was trying to teach a child how to put the clothes away she said go put it in a hamper and the kid looked at her like it is crazy hamper hamper well you know where daddy and mommy and everybody we put our clothes when we take them off and the kid immediately took his clothes and went and he threw them down beside the daddy is bed 

Recording: (9582/ 9621) 
yeah he just used that raynex stuff 

Recording: (9583/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (9584/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9585/ 9621) 
no i mean it is nothing crazy whatever they think they are gotten 

Recording: (9586/ 9621) 
if that happened i would be 10 times more understanding and i would say you know i would accept responsibility for them being in a position to make those mistakes 

Recording: (9587/ 9621) 
they were not being represented i do not know i will have to read i did not read the paper yet 

Recording: (9588/ 9621)

Recording: (9589/ 9621) 
well he is working part time at lazarus but really he does not have anything so i am working 

Recording: (9590/ 9621) 
yeah right because i always keep using my oldest daughter she can get up in the morning and brush her teeth and just barely comb her hair put on a shirt and a pair of pants and go somewhere because she is comfortable with herself she does not have to be made up she does not have to look perfect now my youngest one has to do that and the oldest one i look at her as you know i like myself and if you do not like me well then move on maybe somebody else does and that is the way i am going to be you know and like i said she can clean up and look like a beauty queen but she can also look just like you know just basically you know like she was raking leaves 10 minutes ago and my other one will not leave the house without looking perfect and i just think that is sort of shallow because you know just basically you know like she was raking leaves 10 minutes ago and my other one will not leave the house without looking perfect and i just think that is sort of shallow because you know i look at people who got you know they have to have the facelifts and they got to have the perfect hair and they got to have the perfect clothes it is like you are so insecure about the image you present that you have got to be perfect and by gosh if your hair is out of place you are going to be out of the loop and you know if if people were more comfortable with themselves you know and i am a big one to talk i was like mr insecure for 30 years at least and then i finally got to the point and i went to hell with it you know it is too much work you know either like me or do not if you do not go to somebody else and you know a lot of people are really worried and you know i do not know if boys so much but i know girls are really worried about what people think of them and how they look and it is like why do not you kind of like go past the outside and go inside because my wife was saying the other day she says well i am getting wrinkles and i am thinning on top and i go well obviously you are not looking too close at me because i said mother nature has a way of making your vision get a little worse as time goes by and i honestly feel it is so that that tight butt tight skin woman that you married who is not there anymore still kind of looks that way because 

Recording: (9591/ 9621)

Recording: (9594/ 9621) 
she does not try to get her daughter back she has visitation with her i love her very very much you know that way emotionally but boy i would like for her mom to take her back yeah you know i am fortunate because i got a grant for her through the y ymca at a very nice learning center that she goes to every day so you know of course a lot of that you know hinges on the fact that my son is a student and they are very proeducation you know so my son he is back home now but i wish he would go too he just joined this fraternity 

Recording: (9595/ 9621)
