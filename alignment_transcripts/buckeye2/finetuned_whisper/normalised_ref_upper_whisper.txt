Recording: (11/ 9621) 
yeah and it makes it you know fun so you can actually see what you know your studying these teams does you know you can go a whole season you know seventeen eighteen and o and nobody is pretty much coming close to your standard and when you win all that money it is just like yeah when you lose all that money it is like that is it IM going home <LAUGH> <LAUGH> but i have known people that gamble you know compulsively i mean it is like a gamblers anonymous level i could not really get into that number one i am not the richest person in the world and number two just little money here is one thing but when you are out there spending your car insurance money on it or rent money then you got a real problem there i have seen guys do that to go down to scioto downs and bet the bet the farm on one horse and would not even do anything for them 

Recording: (12/ 9621) 
uh i have learned a lot about cooking lately <LAUGH> 

Recording: (13/ 9621)

Recording: (14/ 9621) 
so just trying to take my time do what i wanna do yeah 

Recording: (15/ 9621) 
i am a senior and i just started my art major in spring so i still have about four quarters left but i am a senior 

Recording: (16/ 9621) 
it is it is 

Recording: (17/ 9621) 
yeah it is projected like six years to take to finish some of these projects own real well i know we drove through georgia you actually see people working on the road there is a whole bunch of people and they are all out there working you know and you get to ohio there is that i do not know something on david david letterman had a picture of this and i think i have seen it before that big sign that says your tax dollars at work you know and there is the construction guy smoking a cigarette leaning up against the sign kinda thing <LAUGH> LIKE GREAT <LAUGH> it was a kinda funny 

Recording: (18/ 9621) 
it is just the way it is i guess but it is like you know she says if the mother is in the house the mother is on duty 

Recording: (19/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (20/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (21/ 9621) 
RIGHT RIGHT but at least we had the stuff outside to look at to keep us interested and and <noisethere> was a lot of i have always loved to travel by car yeah it is it is fun and it is probably because of that early conditioning <LAUGH> i have been i have been in forty eight states 

Recording: (22/ 9621) 
no it was his mom ran away is what happened 

Recording: (23/ 9621) 
oh yeah by the 

Recording: (24/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (25/ 9621) 
yeah it is curious is not it 

Recording: (26/ 9621) 
i do not know um like i said i mean it is something i basically see it almost as being the same thing as like cigarettes or whatever where i mean yeah it is bad for you there is a lot of tar in it things like that but as far as what it the effects it does to you it is no worse thananything alcohol can do to you um so i mean i do not know i mean i am not sure if theyshould actually go so far as to legalize it but i do not think it is really something that they need to really spend that muchtimetrying to control drug problem wise things coming in i mean i know i think it is like switzerland or somewhere like that where they have legalized drugs and they basically do it government based where the government actually gives them out and the government gets the money for it um i can almost see that as being almost a good idea here i mean obviously like i said people are gonna do it no matter what i mean the same thing with guns if they want it they will get their hands on it does not matter what they have to do to it they will they will COME BY IT um i mean actually i mean i could see that they could at leasttake the money from and put it to better use of some sorts if they did the samekindathing 

Recording: (27/ 9621) 
because not only is he a chauvinist pig but he is a bigot TOO <LAUGH> a racist yeah so 

Recording: (28/ 9621) 
all you do is you just keep your records of of um you know what you spend on things and then there is a form you fill out and how much you have if you have taken any depreciation you know you need to basically put that back in and deduct your costs and then there is the percentage that goes on your schedule e that goes on the front of your form that goes into your income and then it is just taxed it is just not it is really not that hard 

Recording: (29/ 9621) 
i well i hope they keep it 

Recording: (30/ 9621) 
he says i did not 

Recording: (31/ 9621) 
yeah i really really hate the fact of a government telling me what to do 

Recording: (32/ 9621) 
yeah most them think the freshman class just ride along i think the freshmen would be little bit tougher you know it would be tougher to be walking around knowing different areas like me i did not know where this hall was i was out there with fifty million halls around me and just stopped once and i said where is lazenby and they that way not too far from where i parked 

Recording: (33/ 9621) 
and that is the way i felt about it not i am not saying that that is not a possibility but 

Recording: (34/ 9621) 
yeah well like the catalog is real small and we have like five hundred thousand things and like the catalog has like a hundred of them so that is really annoying too because then people call up with all these like things that we like do not know if we have in our computer is are really really old like it is like an old style mainframe 

Recording: (35/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (36/ 9621) 
and tell you it is mine now 

Recording: (37/ 9621) 
oh i yeah exactly i was just wondering how could i get a job doing what you are doing <LAUGH> 

Recording: (38/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (39/ 9621) 
or take me to court again you know they got the money i do not 

Recording: (40/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (41/ 9621) 
yes she believes all men will cheat 

Recording: (42/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (43/ 9621) 
actually i do was not even that sure that i wanted to do it until um like senior year and the opportunity came up and i said to her oh this sounds cool you know i had thought of myself as a uh a chemist for a long time and that this opportunity came up yeah i would applied to like other places and i got into university of chicago and i wanted to go there and then this came up here and also i mean it is just ridiculously cheaper here i did not want debt after UNDERGRAD that is just pathetic um my counselor just kind of found it and he would posted it and he specially um tried to notify the national merit people about it and i was the only one who really caught it even though the other ones like half of them wanted to go to medical school they all one of them is at princeton right now you know and they are all off at their ivy leagues like basically working their butts off to get in when i am already in i do not totally understand it 

Recording: (44/ 9621) 
it it 

Recording: (45/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (46/ 9621) 
uh it is all over they contract with dominion homes and dominion is seems like it is going up everywhere and m i so they are all over uh they have projects all over 

Recording: (47/ 9621) 
she just wants to get it over with 

Recording: (48/ 9621) 
even harder 

Recording: (49/ 9621) 
yeah it is seventy years old 

Recording: (50/ 9621) 
and they are not accurate 

Recording: (51/ 9621) 
i know i do i do not want to go i do not want to touch a computer when i go home 

Recording: (52/ 9621) 
that is true 

Recording: (53/ 9621) 
oh yeah yeah and i i think i think even even if you are aware of everything that is here you still in the back of your mind you just have that it is it is just columbus it is just columbus ah maybe it is because um people do not take advantage of do not realize what is actually here um do not realize how it i mean yeah it is not chicago it is not new york it is not SAN FRANSICO there is a lot of places it is not but it is ah you know it is not a backwater either well they need to get out more <LAUGH> I MEAN you know all this oh we will never be a major league city until we have major league sports well you know i guess um getting out more would not help those PEOPLE it is um ah that that would be you know that would be such a small part of of civilization anywhere for me and um i am pretty pleased with the way things are moving along and i just i would i am i really do think people do not take advantage of it the way they should 

Recording: (54/ 9621) 
really um-hum i think it is really good for women to learn about this we should have known about this twenty years ago all these women i know 

Recording: (55/ 9621) 
so she is very limited on working in closed corners and stuff like that uh so she is basically disabled and that goes when they do that it is because of your education and also they take into consideration and everything 

Recording: (56/ 9621) 
which i think is kinda nice so i it looks like the facilities are pretty comfortable i mean my biggest thing is i just wanna have a room to all myself you know i do not wanna go some place where i am gonna HAVE to like deal with SOMEBODY ELSE IN THERE so i mean it looks it looks nice but i would be more comfortable at home i think once i go home 

Recording: (57/ 9621) 
i never learned math <LAUGH> we had in our fifth grade we had the principal realized that nobody knew their times tables he had a big pizza party planned for 

Recording: (58/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (59/ 9621) 
um-hum impressions of columbus well number one i did not realize that it was as big as it is until i started working for the courier service you know i have heard people say and i know it is true that columbus is one of the top ten largest cities in the united states and i was like you are kidding me really i started driving around and i am like yeah it is <LAUGH> this place is huge this place is absolutely behemoth i mean everything within two seventy it is it is pretty darn big and um that was really surprising um i love i just love living in a big city uh i it is just it is just everything is so different than living in the country i mean i miss the big expanses of grass out in the country but i can skate all over the place here in town which i can not do at home i mean i can skate on our driveway but it stops abruptly and in stones <LAUGH> so it gets real boring i mean going down hill is really fun but going back ups pain in the neck but um uh there is a lot more people here i i like lots of people i have discovered i like having lots people around meeting all sorts of new and interesting unique people and every year there is a whole new crowd of freshmen that come in and it it is pretty cool yep <LAUGH> it is enjoyable i like it i do not know if i will stay here i know i would not raise a family here but no i mean ashland is the perfect place to raise family yep but that is about it <LAUGH> and i mean i do not even know how any of the ashland has ashland university it is one of the it is got one of the best theological seminaries in the u s and it is a republican tink thank <LAUGH> republican think tank so aside from the college the town is pretty much agricultural i do not know why i do not know why anybody would want to live there unless they are raising a family because if they are raising a family it is a great place great community it is just great all around for raising a family no i want to find a i want to find some place similar to that i want to find some place that in colorado yeah i love colorado beautiful state it is got some good skiing <LAUGH> yeah skating skiing that is how i did this tore my a c l two years ago christmas day after christmas it is um tendon that it is a tendon right uh right in the front of your knee that keeps yeah that it keeps your it keeps it keeps your knee from moving out and doing all sorts of other miscellaneous twisting and turning position that it is not really supposed to but i ripped that right in half <LAUGH> well what i would do and improve columbus well for one this place is dirty with crap it is it is just so 

Recording: (60/ 9621) 
well i often have to write on papers i believe you turned in the wrong paper i believe i got the rough draft instead of the final copy do you have the final copy somewhere at home 

Recording: (61/ 9621) 
yeah ellen at lane avenue has been a big booster of my work i mean i was really lucky TO RUN across her 

Recording: (62/ 9621) 
it does 

Recording: (63/ 9621) 
and he could not have any kind of caffeine otherwise he would get the shakes and he took all kinds of pills 

Recording: (64/ 9621) 
yeah so that is taking some running around 

Recording: (65/ 9621) 
um i think uh some of it was that i think a lot of it is you do feel lonely um you do go through a period in your life where you do not feel like you have any friends or you feel totally different i mean i STILL GO through that i think we all go through that at some point or other even yearly for some of us um so i am just saying if he felt like he could go to somebody either in his family i say he using those for example or the parents paid a little bit more attention and did not have that blind eye i think that is part of your responsibility as a parent that if you see something potentially evil or wrongdoing in your child is eyes you need to really admit it um i mean you do not wanna do that but 

Recording: (66/ 9621) 
no no i am i am interested 

Recording: (67/ 9621) 
the lower grades we have a few male teachers at first grade and fourth grade but not many but i think that young men young boys would do better in a setting in school if they had a a man earlier on rather than having to wait till they are in middle school to relate to a coach and up until then it is always been a woman 

Recording: (68/ 9621) 
and in this one he could die so 

Recording: (69/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (70/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (71/ 9621) 
you know my daughter you know there was just a lot of stuff when she was in high school and i would call up to the school and you know the principal like he is he would say miss you know i am i am her last chance you know my daughter was going to summer school every summer and he is like mrs you know she is like you know the average student uh she is the type you know that she is gonna get you know she is got gonna get through college you know she is just one of those you know that just moves right along you know she is not the brightest you know but she is bright enough and those are your average professional people out working today and i was just like well i just want more help for my daughter you know i just want somebody to you know jerk her down 

Recording: (72/ 9621) 
well that is great 

Recording: (73/ 9621) 
they had to and they just called me on the phone not knowing you know just that she went to the hospital well they said to me will you stay well i said yes but then when it got in to two weeks and i was not getting any support from the principal or no aid or anything it is like i am sorry i am a SUBSTITUTE SU substitute i am getting sixty dollars a day i can not do this unless you know i have more help and i just flatly said that i am sorry i mean if i would a if it was my own job i would have struggled with it but it was not my own job and i did not know what was gonna happen so if they would have gotten some help in there for me i would have stayed perhaps but no i i you know you can work for under pay and under STAFF AND NEVER you just can not do everything so 

Recording: (74/ 9621) 
um threatening her and stuff like that and uh towards her all i would havetodo is get on the phone and sit there and say you know i can be out there in abouttwo hours you know so i do not know whatyour problem isbut you need to get either talk to me about it talk to your mom about it or go see somebody else and talk to them about it 

Recording: (75/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (76/ 9621) 
and decided to go back to their jobs if you noticed the first time that they voted they voted down this proposal the proposal that their voting on this week is the exact same one 

Recording: (77/ 9621) 
and i am just using that as an example you know what i mean your other drugs i do not know much about them 

Recording: (78/ 9621) 
they could do it my granddaughter my one granddaughter uh they live in springfield they just moved to springfield and she goes to kindergarten only a half day and this child is only uh five years old uh he has them reading the newspaper watching the news she told me a story about christopher columbus um discovering america that was so deep and intense could not believe it was coming from a five year old so this is what the teacher is doing down there 

Recording: (79/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (80/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (81/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (82/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (83/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (84/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (85/ 9621) 
no there was a lot of conflict at home um my dad uh had to support us uh there were four of us and our mother has disabilities and uh she was kind of crazy 

Recording: (86/ 9621) 
i think it is probably too though that a lot of people have not are not used to it i mean they are not from ohio i have found that in columbus a lot so they are kind of you know more tentative or they are from the south or something like that so they and then you run into a lot of people that are from ohio but i have noticed that a lot of people rarely do you meet people born and raised in columbus so 

Recording: (87/ 9621) 
oh okay that was easy 

Recording: (88/ 9621) 
and he is real because people give him that 

Recording: (89/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (90/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (91/ 9621) 
you know so basically well yeah it might work but to me it is kinda stupid you know because what you are saying is we are gonna take this law and really gonna stick you on this law but the hell with all the other laws so is that really fair 

Recording: (92/ 9621) 
that is great 

Recording: (93/ 9621) 
oh is that right 

Recording: (94/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (95/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (96/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (97/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (98/ 9621) 
um he he is a subcontractor and if uh someone is got a job to do at their house he he will do it you know like we we just went and tore the cabinets out of a a house that was on fire and because the smoke damage 

Recording: (99/ 9621) 
the hours because jason works during the day too so it will probably work out pretty well for us 

Recording: (100/ 9621) 
all of his problems have been personal problems that really should not have been touched on except the media got into it and um i mean we look up to the president to be a moral man whatever but if you look at the other nations they were not that shocked that a president would do something like that 

Recording: (101/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (102/ 9621) 
boy that is a that is a really tough one i had not i had not thought about that and and high school kids are so touchy about i mean about touchy about sexual identity and and so likely you know so insecure in their own that they are really likely to come down hard on somebody who has a has a different orientation and i i do not know i do not know 

Recording: (103/ 9621) 
i went to uh um uh just about just a little uh east of here in high school 

Recording: (104/ 9621) 
he works in a factory <LAUGH> 

Recording: (105/ 9621) 
uh all those years and after i left at school here i was at the bureau of employment services i worked for about uh twenty years with uh research and statistics labor market information uh federal state programs collecting information on three different programs in that time then i worked for about a year and a half on a special project uh they were automating the employment services activities and they were going in a complete different direction to match um job needs of employers and applicants to to get more placements for interviews and that sorta thing and i developed that method the the mechanism that check lists and stuff i did uh worked on that uh and i worked for the last three years in jobs training uh for economically disadvantaged youth adults and dislocated workers 

Recording: (106/ 9621) 
and one of them they would looked at in columbus was uh how well he was doing in school well gifted children you have the high uh one of the highest drop rate of out rates in schools they are not doing well so they need to be taught differently and then they cut this moneys uh my feeling is you know there is lot of programs in school there is sponsored by the federal government particularly uh to help the the students are that are behind and that is important 

Recording: (107/ 9621) 
when they are giving a four or five thousand dollar a year to someone who is making two hundred three hundred thousand dollars i do not care if i get five dollars that will not even buy me a tank of gas today keep the money and do something good with it 

Recording: (108/ 9621) 
that is fine humum i do not my husband does but i kind of sleep between them when they are but right now i have cause we have early on we took our bed down and just kind of had like the mattress and the boxspring on the floor and i have got like comforters on the side of the bed so cause he is like he will like get out he is just like i do not wanna be in the bed with these guys and he will get on the floor and he will sleep on the comforters on the floor but he is close and he is happy that WAY <LAUGH> um-hum 

Recording: (109/ 9621) 
yes hopefully 

Recording: (110/ 9621) 
you have a preference at five or six but by the time you turn eight one of your hemispheres is pretty much decided it is gonna be the one that runs the show well then that is when those reversals and all that backward fives and threes and stuff usually drops out of the picture so hm 

Recording: (111/ 9621) 
mhm right 

Recording: (112/ 9621) 
<LAUGH>

Recording: (116/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (117/ 9621) 
yeah and it is like number one in the union and that is like such a disturbing fact to me that you could take someone is life and be like oh our bad that person was innocent you know 

Recording: (118/ 9621) 
ah 

Recording: (119/ 9621) 
no uh uh 

Recording: (120/ 9621)

Recording: (121/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (122/ 9621) 
humum 

Recording: (123/ 9621) 
and why what he he is he is too busy 

Recording: (124/ 9621) 
that is what 

Recording: (125/ 9621) 
you know ai not no way in hell you have one nowadays 

Recording: (126/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (127/ 9621) 
one of the he has the most experience 

Recording: (128/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (129/ 9621) 
because you know they they bypass me straight mom mom mom you know 

Recording: (130/ 9621) 
uh yeah my parents live in akron uh like north of akron cuyahoga falls area but like i said i my uh i had apartment down there but like for the summer i am down here so i am a transient always moving my stuff 

Recording: (131/ 9621) 
you know decide where you are going why do you just waste all your time running around like that 

Recording: (132/ 9621) 
so we DID IT it is well he is always had some problems it is um his problem is staying focused on things unless it is something he is extremely interested in then you can not get him away from it um if it is something he it is the just an example in school he would sit there and he would be rolling around on the floor and stuff while they are trying to teach something in class or working on a writing assignment or something and half hour to work on it he would be the last five minutes the teacher say you know you really need to get that done he would sit down and write it the fifth grade he was writing on a college level and he would could do it that quickly um i think he is lost ground on that now but and that was just an example in the second grade the school he went to was an open classroom and uh he had been through some couple the traditional schools already and the principal said we had told the talked to the principal about the problems we were having with him staying focused and she said well we can work with that well about halfway through the year she says it is not working and they have an arrangement and with and i doubt if most the people in the parents in the school are even aware of this with childrens hospital the counseling center they set a room aside and they send counselors in once a month to work with the students it is open classroom it is experimental so there is people coming and going all the time and no but how we were never aware of it i i doubt if most the people are aware of it and they met with us and then a week later they went and observed him and he was they were the teacher was telling a story and then asking questions about and said he was the counselors said he was up and walking around and running around and playing with his shoes and stuff like that she said but if came time to answer the questions he knew every answer so he said he that they decided not to precede at that time because this is frustrating too it was our wedding anniversary and my wife said now how about for our wedding anniversary we just get a good report for the whole week but that was unusual and he was not a bad kid 

Recording: (133/ 9621)

Recording: (134/ 9621)

Recording: (138/ 9621) 
belgium is it is own country 

Recording: (139/ 9621) 
yeah and a lot of them is been getting off the hook lately see this guy on uh hard copy he killed this woman is husband because he was in love with her and they ended up letting him go because he was supposedly incapable of making his own decisions now i think that there is there is uh things in your brain that trigger ideas and if you have a wide you know a wider version of what they i do not know what they call it it is in that magazine there what triggers the violence and violent thoughts people actually do think more about the violence when they commit it than the accidental you know some of it is mindless some of it is not but everybody thinks <LAUGH> 

Recording: (140/ 9621) 
professors yeah well well i am as i mentioned a while ago i happen to have i am a one of fifteen siblings

YOU were adopted by two DADS i mean i mean there is a lot uh it is it is difficult to adopt children i mean and it and it should be and so the children they would likely take would be troubled to begin with

Recording: (176/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (177/ 9621)

Recording: (186/ 9621) 
no no but that but that is what i am saying but but that is that is what i am saying and the same things happening when we had a bussing we took kids out of the poor environment and put them in nice environment oh they they have got the taste of it then went back home oh and we did and very unjustice thing to those kids and to the families and then when we broke them up we did something else you know take them out then we lost that community involvement so now the parents can not follow their kids to their activities get them splitting it up hey we do not want them we do not want a families that is a misnomer they said the fam the community raises the family the kids yeah that is how they want you to think but the family the community will not rereplace the family 

Recording: (187/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (188/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (189/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (190/ 9621) 
YEAH see i hate that like all the work that you do is like reduced to like one letter 

Recording: (191/ 9621) 
well and 

Recording: (192/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (193/ 9621) 
its the way i feel 

Recording: (194/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (195/ 9621) 
right after high school i think there was probably f i will say six and amazingly uh well three were still together 

Recording: (196/ 9621) 
are they but they all look alike 

Recording: (197/ 9621) 
no no no but 

Recording: (198/ 9621) 
janet we just had a man who took time to 

Recording: (199/ 9621) 
oh okay 

Recording: (200/ 9621) 
em aw that is nice yeah i am sure 

Recording: (201/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (202/ 9621) 
that is true 

Recording: (203/ 9621) 
uh they uh stopped federally funding uh o s u that was a federal control tower and they contracted it out so you either lost your job and stayed there and worked for the contractor or you picked up and moved on and you know some people moved like to arizona and california and and i thought well since i only have like two and a half years til i retire and i really like columbus and i thought i do not want to uproot my daughters out of school and and leave and start over so i thought well i will just go to port columbus and suffer it out until i can 

Recording: (204/ 9621) 
so i guess i mean that went well that was really really hard for me i i would uh call all my family members i had family members coming over to try to figure out what this child needed but i do not know i could not tell you what he went through with that crying spell but he did go where he just did not quit crying 

Recording: (205/ 9621) 
i try to be as much as possible too i think it it is very important that both parents they see both 

Recording: (206/ 9621) 
take the ferry from london 

Recording: (207/ 9621) 
city council of dayton and had highlighted a whole bunch of it and hoping that uh they would do something along that line um shoulda gone to columbus at the same time very interesting 

Recording: (208/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (209/ 9621) 
yeah and i really think both of them will be good parents someday but she says we are not ready 

Recording: (210/ 9621) 
my dad seems to think i should go on to law because there is law in everything you can do anything with a law degree 

Recording: (211/ 9621) 
well personally i voted that the thirty three should pass i think they should the way i understood i am they have ways of wording those things that you had to read it very carefully to know whether you should say yes or no on the thing i said yes because i uh uh analyzed it to say that they are repealing something that was passed i think it one or two years ago that was things to be done up around the polaris area like new roads and this and that and i want that repealed because i do not think we should be helping anybody else to do that and taking the money away from the other things 

Recording: (212/ 9621) 
oh my god 

Recording: (213/ 9621) 
or um like it a little less or dislike it a little more when when it it looks like it is gonna come to it looks like they are it feels like they are trying to tease me as an audience and uh uh i that is not something i feel peased by particularly 

Recording: (214/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (215/ 9621) 
what kind 

Recording: (216/ 9621) 
would not even think about asking 

Recording: (217/ 9621) 
yeah i i thought in the beginning i missed mirror lake cafe so bad because the good subs and all that i do not i do not know why i missed them i do not i go back and now i just do not like it anymore 

Recording: (218/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (219/ 9621) 
whenever he well i thought he was gonna be elected uh mayor too but he did not there but i do not know what that was about but um uh you know he is got his and their gonna reelect him because he stands up for the minority i think he what he makes a mistake is saying labeling things racist that are not necessarily racist but anyway 

Recording: (220/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (221/ 9621) 
yeah it is just like uh having alcohol around mean gambling is a lot like alcohol it can be addicting it can screw your life up and you will spend your last dollar on it if you are that far gone so pretty much anything can be one of those factors <LAUGH> 

Recording: (222/ 9621) 
um i would agree that i think regardless of your race you should be able to adopt a child i mean just because you are a black kid living with like a white family does not mean you can not still have your heritage or whatever to be proud of i mean it is the same THING with like irish people adopting like italian babies or something like that i mean it is no different i mean as long as basically you know your roots and where you came from i mean i can not see it being a problem of any sorts um i mean just as long as they have someone that cares for the kid and does stuff for them i mean i can not see it being any 

Recording: (223/ 9621) 
i personally agree with that but that is just from my own moral beliefs and everything but i do not know i i do not think that there is one solution that will fit every every child and every situation i mean my husband had his daughter when he was seventeen so you know obviously his he said his dad told him about condoms you know so they are gonna make that decision on their own i say just and and plus with the internet and everything they they have access to so much information and i think that it falls back on the parents still if you are gonna be a parent you need to be RESPONSIBLE and i do not think that it is getting done 

Recording: (224/ 9621) 
i know 

Recording: (225/ 9621) 
um in general i think i think the united states has a fairly well developed like class not like class structure in which you can not move up or down but like we have a a fairly large middle class 

Recording: (226/ 9621) 
yeah and 

Recording: (227/ 9621)

Recording: (249/ 9621)

Recording: (250/ 9621) 
yeah there is uh some people there just get lazy then you got the college students they i do not know how many of them work but most of them there is just from out of town 

Recording: (251/ 9621)

Recording: (260/ 9621) 
it is funny because i had studied russian but a lot of the people i served with were fluent in spanish or something else so it is like i do not know why they got sent there but it is i i mean we really believe that there that it is inspired they send our your name and a picture and your application to the prophet who is the head of the church and um they pray over it and they decide where you go 

Recording: (261/ 9621)

Recording: (268/ 9621) 
yeah you you can not have a beer gut and a big ass and it means you are it means you are sloppy and lazy if you do but if a man does it is like by god he is probably got some power behind him and it is like duh he is probably just as lazy as anybody else it is like you know i have you know i hate to see girls starve themselves to death you know it is like uh you know there are certain times in your life where you are gonna be fat you know you know my my youngest daughter has a problem with that you know she is i do not know why she is so insecure because she out of the four of us including her sister is like you know right at the top i mean she has done television commercials she is done radio voice overs she is been in plays and she was in a highschool play when she was in uh a kindergarten student and actually had speaking part and i am sitting there in the audience like in tears because and i would i am like why am i crying but it is like you know how can she do this and you know like you see her i saw her in a few tv commercials and i am like i tried to do that and if you can picture driving along a highway at night with your bright lights on and a deer doing this that is about how good i am in those and she is just like you know and she is she is not a smart ass you know she does not show off but she is just so relaxed doing this and it is it looks so natural but she does not see that because you know you know uh she always thinks she is very uh mediocre uh and i go but janelle i said you know you have been in front of television cameras and you do so well i said you get on the radio you do well i said you do well in school you have a ton of friends i said you have a great body i said you know i said i never compare the two of them but there are sometimes when i hafta i said look at your sister she has the same chest i do i said you definitely are well built there i said you have a nice shape i said when you have a bathing suit on it is like i go somebody put a towel on her you know and i said you know you just do not realize all the physical and and also the character attributes you have i said you have a great personality i said you go in a room of a hundred people with me and your sister and about three days later somebody will go john and jalena who but in ten minutes they will go where is janelle at because they all know you you are just so easy to get along with and everybody likes you and i said you just do not realize this gigantic list of character physical and mental traits you have that i can never even come close to having 

Recording: (269/ 9621) 
you know that is not because i am skilled or anything it is because well when i was a kid my dad was crippled i had to fix everything so 

Recording: (270/ 9621)

Recording: (274/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (275/ 9621) 
what would you do <LAUGH> oh god you know i feel like a i was a parent before i was a parent you know <LAUGH> i have that is the way it felt it was like some of my friends like like this guy i used to hang out with he he used to run into lockers in high school i am like that is so kid 

Recording: (276/ 9621) 
and that type of person i do not think would make a very effective president because i do not know president needs to be able to think fast on their feet 

Recording: (277/ 9621) 
uh it is bishop it is a now you are you are not from around here so it is like it is a catholic school over on the west side 

Recording: (278/ 9621) 
yeah uh somebody is gotta get k get you know put george bush to the back 

Recording: (279/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> YEAH <LAUGH> <LAUGH> yeah that is 

Recording: (280/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (281/ 9621) 
um i i think it fills its niche you know i mean i mean wexner has a niche and the and the museum has a niche and um i think it fills it very well 

Recording: (282/ 9621) 
that so that if you if whoever won you know would get but we just went on field trips and had a great time <LAUGH> it might be better NOW <LAUGH> 

Recording: (283/ 9621) 
he is gonna he is gonna be there all summer you know i did not decide i wanted to change it over until i got my scanner um and found out that when i checked the web site for the scanner that they are just simply flat out not making windows two thousand drivers for my scanner so it is a um crap i do not know i just got it i can not even remember what it is um paper port i think it is paper port avoid windows two thousand at all costs stick with ninety eight much better much better operating system <LAUGH> 

Recording: (284/ 9621) 
do not go into elementary ed that much 

Recording: (285/ 9621) 
well i i enjoy this <LAUGH> but it it will be impersonal uh because here you are eh oo i am i can not face you i do not know whether you are really kidding me in what you are TALKING ABOUT sitting there in the in that uh street CAFE OR NOT <LAUGH> but i really do think we are gonna be interconnected in that sense and uh um it it becomes so much more impersonal i guess i am very strong about the term personal versus impersonal inner communications um and the bad that we have talked about i think will be a part of that ten and twenty years from now but i think we will have begun by that time to try to clean up the act if you will uh going back to the political question i think that financial things who i think we will start we will start slowing that down oh i think we will have less influence uh in the terms of finance and i do not think we will get back to abraham lincoln days but uh if we can swing that pendulum back uh uh i think we i think we can and i think we will i think we can do the same thing with communications uh i think we can eliminate a lot of the uh bad bad influences i do know that over time what we would have called bad back here is not necessarily bad here sort of like the definition of need versus luxury uh those definitions change the definition of socialism democracy that slowly have changed over these times well the same thing will true be true with those it is still functioning <LAUGH> excuse me um and i think we will also slowly swing that pendulum on back to the and to the family again there are those doomsayer from my point of view are saying that uh in in many years to come there will not be such a thing as a family uh it is just you you go out here you meet a an opposite sex you procreate and you go on your way she goes on her way and she is just as satisfied about going her way as you are going your way um yes a lot of that is true but i think that uh i think that i do not think that is gonna ever happen i think we will turn that thing around i think this so called divorce rate program as i talked about awhile ago that uh every well fifty percent of the people who marry within five years are no longer together i think that will will change and that is a very significant thing i think in terms of getting back to the basic family 

Recording: (286/ 9621) 
i feel like i should be standing out there giving money because my bills are getting behind 

Recording: (287/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (288/ 9621) 
i am not sure i am ready to go back through ALL THAT 

Recording: (289/ 9621) 
absent for the whole day which would be considered truant so they said i well i had to do was go down to juvenile to this certain gentleman in juvenile and have him file charges so i took my son down to him and he said it was the school should have did that so in the meantime he is telling me that my son is in getting ready to go eleventh grade and neither side is gonna do anything about it somebody should have did something about that because then you know they would have been doing what they were supposed to do to make him you know get in line and uh so he knew he could get by with it 

Recording: (290/ 9621) 
and the fact that i recognized all that and could not wait to get out of there and when i was gone i was gone and and even now we still have this ongoing thing where my in fact i have been happy about them lately because um i have well we have lived in our same house for twenty years and my parents say they live in florida they um i mean they are not well to do by any means but they they are not lacking for anything and they can afford to take plane trips and they can afford to go to california twice a year to they spend a week with my brother etc etc and they come here a couple times a year and they stay at my sister is house they have only come to my home three times in twenty years and that is because they do not wanna get off the freeway they will drive through columbus from florida to go to visit people in in akron and masillon and they stay in cincinnati and they stay in springfield with my sisters and they will not do it because it is just to they do not wanna have to deal with that traffic they do not like that and it is and just recently i finally said you know i do not understand why you can not do that you know i have actually called them i am fifty two 

Recording: (291/ 9621) 
i would say there would be certain life application things that all kids should know but not i do not think that you can say everything you know you have everybody has do this because you know people are individuals and you have to take that in to consideration i think so 

Recording: (292/ 9621) 
i know 

Recording: (293/ 9621) 
yeah it was <LAUGH> 

Recording: (294/ 9621) 
well i already think that is happening right now because i think that i do not know what the divorce statistics have been recently but i do see that more people who are getting married are staying married because those that would do not those that would have gotten a divorce they are not bothering to get married to begin with they are just living together and if they separate so what and i think that 

Recording: (295/ 9621) 
um i talk to him every now and then 

Recording: (296/ 9621) 
you know white napkins and you know we would go there for lunch you know you dress nice and uh you know i i like that and i would uh like you know my grand kids to be able to go downtown with me like that you know rather than have to drive off to a mall 

Recording: (297/ 9621) 
yeah that part was no different i mean 

Recording: (298/ 9621) 
they had a two by four on the door for over a month 

Recording: (299/ 9621) 
now that that go over well here would not it 

Recording: (300/ 9621) 
so the 

Recording: (301/ 9621) 
i mean he would have he would have been in the money then because he was just starting his business down there and uh while i while i was down there he had me sleeping in a truck a moving truck and uh oh man it was it is a hilarious story i mean thirty foot moving truck i am sleeping in it and i get uh 

Recording: (302/ 9621) 
now who does he work for 

Recording: (303/ 9621) 
and some of that is controlled with medication now but not all of it because they because of the drug and alcohol they will not put him on some of the medications so but as far as i can tell he is been pretty clear and clean on that end uh you know like once she got pregnant they both stopped smoking she is taking very good care of herself she uh she lately has been going with him to the psychologist and oh uh we have been paying for it but we do not have a problem with that because he is GOING <LAUGH> he likes the psychologist so took a long time to get to that point but uh so we have been talking to the psychologist about it and he said this should be he said most people that raised in that background he said they go two different ways ones they they just fall into the same uh pattern as their parents or they are survivors she appears to be a survivor uh she is never really had what i would call a normal family relationship she likes to spend time with us uh which i am glad uh and she we really like her she is really it we enjoy being with her but sometimes more than being with my son uh 

Recording: (304/ 9621) 
so i i try to gear what he watches towards educational programming instead of just junk <LAUGH> 

Recording: (305/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (306/ 9621)

Recording: (312/ 9621) 
i think i think they should um i think a lot of the fear of this material comes uh from people who hold the belief that that you choose your orientation that you can be converted to homosexuality and i personally do not believe that so it i you know i am not afraid of it but i can see how people would hold the opposite view and that i that is where this comes from but since i think they are wrong <LAUGH> i think it should be my way and i think i think you know i think the material should be there i think it you know dealt with in a calm and reasonable way and i think it should be accessible to the kids 

Recording: (313/ 9621) 
yeah yeah i heard something about that 

Recording: (314/ 9621) 
i retired about uh four years ago from the state i worked there for thirty years actually i started working for the state when i school here i worked here and that counted those five years counted towards retirement so i was able to retire early and then the last uh about the last two and a half years i have been working the symphony in the box office started part time and then i was full time for a while and then i requested to be cut back to part time again because uh 

Recording: (315/ 9621)

Recording: (316/ 9621) 
mm 

Recording: (317/ 9621) 
huh um 

Recording: (318/ 9621) 
okay just is it like a kind of snobbish or are they a 

Recording: (319/ 9621) 
i not really a big fan uh i think one of the big problems is gonna be uh uh initially just the uh uh the monetary thing of it you know the people that supported the uh basically supported the uh uh minor league teams that they had here you know uh were like blue collar people and that you go for twenty thirty bucks and have a good time get drunk throw beer and and up there you know you are not gonna be able to do that it is gonna cost you uh a minimum of fifty to a hundred dollars probably take a family there couple of kids or something like that you know 

Recording: (320/ 9621) 
or anything like that i mean that is something that i do not know i would sorta make known to them but not something that i would really push on them 

Recording: (321/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (322/ 9621) 
actually i that is what got me interested and so i went to library school and 

Recording: (323/ 9621)

Recording: (325/ 9621) 
since i have been on both worlds <LAUGH> 

Recording: (326/ 9621) 
it was not publicized to the degree that it is now it seems like anymore nothing is sacred i mean as far as papers are concerned and uh there is something else that i i guess i am old fashioned but i do not think we need all this publicity about all the sexual escapades of all the people that are or have lives uh i just uh i think maybe i am old fashioned but i and they i can hardly conceive anyone being a genuine homosexual i mean evidently they are um but uh it is so against human nature i think or against conventional human nature anyway 

Recording: (327/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (328/ 9621) 
she helped a lot 

Recording: (329/ 9621)

Recording: (333/ 9621) 
uh we took um uh i took uh military ethics as a philosophy course and that was really interesting because even though in even in that hierarchy there is still certain contexts within the context of war for instance if if we both know if we knowingly go into it as combatants and we are fighting for whatever cause but if we both are willingly going into it 

Recording: (334/ 9621)

Recording: (380/ 9621) 
uh well we put all kinds of information out on our own website which there is so much it is very hard to find what you want ya know it is that is a constant problem with information is the more you put out there the harder it is to find what you want but if you can not get to it if it is not out there you can not find it uh it it is a problem for us and for libraries because there is just a barrage of what they are getting and it is not just from us it is from the literature uh there is literally ya know hundreds of library publications uh and it is a problem that librarians are facing all the time they can not keep up 

Recording: (381/ 9621) 
and i was raised here most of my life 

Recording: (382/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (383/ 9621)

Recording: (388/ 9621) 
then the other one just fit in really 

Recording: (389/ 9621) 
a little bit yeah 

Recording: (390/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (391/ 9621) 
that is perfect 

Recording: (392/ 9621) 
they uh what they 

Recording: (393/ 9621) 
although i have not been paying a lot of attention to it just because i do not know 

Recording: (394/ 9621) 
you are so embarrassed i am so sorry and the guy is like ah nobody else is eating it she MIGHT AS WELL <LAUGH>

Recording: (396/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (397/ 9621) 
no well he right now he is really interested in eastern religions i am not sure where that came from you know when they go to college and they are gone and you do not see them much uh that is what he is interested in right now so i do not think it it it it really took 

Recording: (398/ 9621) 
well he told a jewish friend of mine that her grandparents that died in the holocaust went to hell because they were jewish 

Recording: (399/ 9621) 
is that right 

Recording: (400/ 9621) 
because i have seen more violence on alcohol i have seen more women beat i have seen more kids beat i have seen more drunken driving wrecks 

Recording: (401/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (402/ 9621) 
and their needs were immediate 

Recording: (403/ 9621) 
it is so i just see a pattern you know i just feel like this is gonna happen to me eventually 

Recording: (404/ 9621) 
i was gonna say i i have seen situations too where i can see their side of it as well because the mothers are used to or the wives are used to being home and the husbands support them and in those situations they still want them to they still do not want to go out there and do that and um and you know they need to look at each one of those cases too because i know there is alimony and all that kind of thing and and that can be detrimental to the man because he can never go out and have another life or have another wife and you know 

Recording: (405/ 9621) 
oh really where are you from 

Recording: (406/ 9621) 
because um i think the fact that things like responsibility maybe a long time ago people stayed married because they felt like they had a responsibility to take care of of their family i mean and you can be divorced and still take CARE of your family instead of uh you know things as far as people getting pregnant and and then this person goes off and and leaves and you have got a lot of unmarried single women that are all by themselves and and it is just it is more socially acceptable to to be able to do these things now then i think it was a long time ago i mean peoples families would not would never stand for something like that they would say look you need to take care of this you need to deal with this and now it is just it is kind of normal and everybody just kinda goes along with it 

Recording: (407/ 9621) 
all the kids in the world who all that that will happen through that bad influence all the kids 

Recording: (408/ 9621)

Recording: (414/ 9621) 
well the charge was cutting class yeah and what it was i was supposed to meet my mom outside i told my teacher i brought a note and got a excuse slip and all that i went down to my locker before and the teacher we called her the general because she would always be out there watching you not a teacher but administrator excuse me and she was out there and she saw me at my locker and what are you doing down here and the whole thirty minute conversation that could have only lasted five minutes with thank you okay here is my slip she thought i forged the slip 

Recording: (415/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (416/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (417/ 9621) 
i am an independent 

Recording: (418/ 9621) 
um and and trying to stop it um uh i am trying to think of some good examples i mean when politicians start talking about like biological functions 

Recording: (419/ 9621) 
yeah it is a tour it is a package tour ah ya know rome florence venice pisa does not interest me 

Recording: (420/ 9621) 
exactly yeah 

Recording: (421/ 9621) 
it was a law enforcement career center and i mean 

Recording: (422/ 9621) 
well well it is sort of like the sociology of like cliques you know like how how that develops like how people like some people seek to like fit in like like that is a real strong uh like 

Recording: (423/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (424/ 9621) 
and how old are you and i know like one point in time it is like we do not want to hang out with you crystal i am like well fine i do not CARE i will go hang out with them <LAUGH> it is like they they still need to do a lot of growing up 

Recording: (425/ 9621) 
uh yeah they uh near near west side is always been in pretty bad area well in the last forty or fifty years and it is starting to creep west 

Recording: (426/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (427/ 9621) 
yeah that is true well we o s u is and they have got a nice facility i mean they have uh uh uh like a labor and delivery room it is got like it is weird though because when you go they show you they they talk about all this whirlpool bath thing a room with it i do not know if you have heard those commercials or not but there is only one room that is like that 

Recording: (428/ 9621) 
and uh and that is really an important issue right now i i i saw that the first time in nineteen ninety two because i uh uh uh i have not said it yet but you know anyone who listening to this tape or you would be able to know i am a democrat and generally vote democratic although i will tell you i i did vote for greg lashuka once and if he had run again i would have voted for him because i like his style and he has not been bad for the city but um i am generally a democrat uh and i have only voted for two people who won the presidential election and i knew in ninety two early on that clinton was gonna win just by being out with people and i was at a restaurant one time with my girlfriend and a waiter came up and um he said something about you know and i can not remember how we got started on the topic you know just taking my my order for a restaurant but he said something about um uh dole was too old and this was a young guy he was in college and i knew there was there was a a a sort of a shift people wanted someone with younger ideas and um a new vision they did not want the world war two vision anymore uh and i thought that was was was kind of interesting because by and large most young people also supported reagan and i thought do they really understand the difference in issues and what the two stand for but it was that reagan appeared young and charismatic and so did clinton so i think for the average voter that does have a a lot of sway 

Recording: (429/ 9621) 
or the festivals in the summer that they have downtown i mean those are those are really great and they are you know i mean they are they are crowded but they are peaceful you know there is not there is not rioting in the streets and there is a lot to do and great you know great music 

Recording: (430/ 9621) 
really and it is a fun job it really is i i have only ever known one male that taught first grade and i knew one guy that taught third most the time if they go in to elementary ed they go for the upper grades like four five or six but um i really think that if we let the boys be more exposed to men earlier then they would be more motivated to learn because they would see that it is not just a girly thing they would say oh well mister so and so thinks it is important that i know this and he is a real macho guy so i better learn it you know i do i really do nowadays with the pay being better we are getting more men but

Recording: (470/ 9621) 
well my son started yeah i son started public school for kindergarten and he just my son is my son is a very social child we will say he is the one that talks too much as the teachers say he is the social child he talks too much he likes to get up and run around and he needs something very structured i mean he needs time to run around but he needs something very structured you get him near a bunch of other kids when he was little and it was like he would just run and scream at them cause he was ready to play well yeah and yeah my and my my daughter is the opposite that uh but he would do that and so he was not he was very he was not learning things and he was constantly getting in trouble it was like i i do not know we would be told he was a problem but he did not understand what was going on and it there was not structure he would go to school everyday and not know what to expect because there was not like this we will do this and then we will do this and we will do this so we checked out the catholic school and they were organized that way and it just was a better better match for him and then my daughter went to school was just easier to take them to the same school and that goes back reminded me of another thing i wanted to say about why the discipline and and behavior may be different in the catholic school is you are paying big you are paying bucks you know it is four forty five hundred dollars a year for us to send her to school uh and if we find out she is not doing her work it is very different PERSPECTIVE 

Recording: (471/ 9621) 
is really opposing my beliefs so i stand there and pretty much spar with him about it and he usually ends up getting frustrated and tells me to leave 

Recording: (472/ 9621) 
is it oh that is a good day 

Recording: (473/ 9621) 
yes for attention and uh yeah 

Recording: (474/ 9621) 
um-hum um-hum but i do not know if that is i think that the divorce rate has gone up because it is more socially acceptable i am sure there is plenty of people twenty years ago that would have loved to have GOTTEN A DIVORCE had that been an option um i i think it just i think a lot of it is just depends on the way you handle it you know how you how you handle it after after the the divorce is final i mean not do you see does that make any sense at all 

Recording: (475/ 9621) 
i well you know i i do not see how we can say i mean we can refuse to to see certain classes of movies or or watch certain classes of shows but i you know without getting into that first amendment thing i can not you know i do not see how we can have a code of conduct yeah yeah boy i do not know i am i am you know i have never seen it happen in in my lifetime you know so i i do not know if it could be but then of course it can not go on the same way you know it can not keep PROGRESSING i do not think 

Recording: (476/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (477/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (478/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (479/ 9621) 
uh essentially dying and so we were dealing with all of this at the same time and it was i mean there was one night i remember we were ready to leave the hospital about seven thirty we checked to see if there was any messages at home to see if we would heard from him uh and got a message that my mother in law had fallen and she was in an emergency room the same hospital fortunately so went down there then on the way home got a phone call on the cell phone uh from the hospital that my father in law had to had some bleeding so we had to go back to hospital and then we went around driving around looking for my son this was all and this was not unusual it was a horrible period and uh i think what made my wife and i the angriest was that he is the only one that really could control his behavior the others could not 

Recording: (480/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (481/ 9621) 
that is not a shocking surprise i mean i rarely get a kid for math although we do have kids that are learning disabled and they do not understand math either even though it is very concrete 

Recording: (482/ 9621) 
government does not seem to work too swiftly 

Recording: (483/ 9621) 
yeah it is a really disciplined school but it is lot of rebellion in it the same time 

Recording: (484/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (485/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> sometimes i think that it is just like math sucks and it is like 

Recording: (486/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (487/ 9621) 
exactly HUGE 

Recording: (488/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (489/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (490/ 9621) 
it is major things that you have to do that are a lot more time consuming 

Recording: (491/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (492/ 9621) 
well i should tell them that they should love themselves the the girls should wear both of them should love their bodies and not you know give it to a boy that is you know falling all over you and you are you feel all good and this and that you should respect yourself and love your body and you know do not let do not give yourself to somebody just because you are feeling you are feeling good um and the boys i should <LAUGH> the boys need to calm down <LAUGH> um i do not i i mean 

Recording: (493/ 9621) 
she uh has trouble driving even at night and stuff like that 

Recording: (494/ 9621) 
ecstasy yes there are a few people that i know that use it 

Recording: (495/ 9621) 
on the issues but i think it does mean a lot to other people so i can not really answer that question how they would have voted uh because i did not think that mike coleman exactly had charisma either 

Recording: (496/ 9621) 
oh i know 

Recording: (497/ 9621) 
we are buying it yeah and we should have it paid off about five years so we are talking about moving someplace a little simpler to take care of 

Recording: (498/ 9621) 
i do not know like i think i think uh high school in general like they i people always talk about raising the standards you know for high for high school things but um i think um it is kind of like it is it is really hard to to like i have thought about before just what is wrong with like the education system in general like i do not know i think it is more of a more of like a it is college is a little bit different i guess but it is more of like this whole like the teacher the teacher is talking and it like it like the information goes from like the like the teacher is uh mouth to the student is notes with like out without going through either of their brains you know it is like just from like real monotonous and like you know dates and blah blah blah about you know just like it is it is a it is real structured but it is real hard to think about what then what i could what to do to change that it is kind of like more like i do not know i mean i had really good like there was a couple really good teachers like my history teachers and english teachers were really good um 

Recording: (499/ 9621) 
was she where is she from latin america 

Recording: (500/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (501/ 9621) 
you see 

Recording: (502/ 9621) 
and you do not the problem is as a youngsters you grow up you do not realize how much your parents did for you until you are probably until you are about thirty five forty you do not realize my goodness mom and dad you made a sacrifice because now i am learning a little more what you did and then by the time you are uh maybe sixty fifty sixty now you got take care of your parents if you have the morals to do it otherwise just ship them off to the farm 

Recording: (503/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (504/ 9621) 
the three r is you know i think those are still very important 

Recording: (505/ 9621) 
uh right and they were actually able to select the couple from a they talked to a a lawyer who arranges adoptions and she had a file and they you know threw kind of a bunch of questions and answers type thing were to limit to down to three couples and they liked the first couple they met so 

Recording: (506/ 9621) 
go along with what my father thinks and says and if he wants it a certain way why you just do not question that and i just do not do that it is wrong 

Recording: (507/ 9621) 
definitely 

Recording: (508/ 9621) 
yeah because i do not have a degree 

Recording: (509/ 9621) 
and a lot ofitwas the the bitterness of the divorce 

Recording: (510/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (511/ 9621) 
YEAH 

Recording: (512/ 9621) 
they do not do it today unless the person is a scholar i mean a you have point eight rhodes scholar hey okay 

Recording: (513/ 9621) 
so it it is been very difficult for us particularly the last four years and about the time he ran away was er between the time my father in law died and my mother in law died which was in a five month period so my wife is had an awful lot to deal with um she is had a lot to deal with in that time 

Recording: (514/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (515/ 9621) 
just 

Recording: (516/ 9621) 
right the hardest both the hardest and easiest thing i think i have ever done was knowing when it was time to take him to the vet to have him euthanized 

Recording: (517/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (518/ 9621) 
no i would not have 

Recording: (519/ 9621) 
getting them some place stable 

Recording: (520/ 9621) 
i think it is the right position to take um but it it like abortion that is one of the the big issues that divide people very quickly uh i think it is moderating somewhat uh as the gay activists continue their campaigns um but that is one where a candidate has to tread very carefully um i was proud that coleman said it and did not and did not back down on that um they told me a little bit about his character um i do not know that i can answer your question straight forward because i believe in gay i believe in anybody is rights what happens between consenting adults in a bedroom is their business not mine 

Recording: (521/ 9621) 
yeah it was like yeah uh was five weeks early delivering so it was really you know unplanned as far as when we were expecting it 

Recording: (522/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (523/ 9621) 
i do not know that much about it to be quite honest i did read about it in the paper and i know the whole thing with um chief jackson and the whole um mayoral candidates how they are getting in debates over that an i know this is something new on top of that um i know it was the front page on sunday is paper i looked at it briefly um i think there must be some truth to it i do not know the extent 

Recording: (524/ 9621) 
well i would say in springfield yeah 

Recording: (525/ 9621) 
right right i think there is uh you they are so many small communities like even o o s u is really a obviously its own its own little community and then you have got you know dublin and they have got their own parades and their own different things so i agree i mean i think that that you there really is a lot of things to do in our own individual area that i can not see somebody from dublin going over to the west side to to do ANYTHING <LAUGH> you know what i i do not and uh maybe also i i feel safer where i live too and and that is something that is an issue for me i know when i do travel down cleveland avenue it makes me it does it makes me nervous so i just kinda stay away from that um 

Recording: (526/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah 

Recording: (527/ 9621) 
i was forty eight when i retired so it is great it is terrific 

Recording: (528/ 9621) 
no well it is like you buy it and then you would get to do the shopping the fun part you go out pick out wallpaper and cabinets and all this and that and then you have somebody else do that PART <LAUGH> but i do not do like major gutting or anything i just like to get something that needs that that that i can have a vision i can usually see this can be really fabulous if you take care of this bathroom and kitchen and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah so that is the kind stuff and i have only done three or four of them but it is fun 

Recording: (529/ 9621) 
um well i think the price has a lot to do with it because i mean that is what i see see over there that prevents it you know there a sort of middle of the line dress that would be like at the limited here or something is you know seventy five pounds you know at like a dollar sixty five or whatever conversion i mean that is a lot you know you see them in the limited and you think whatever the price is expensive but you know really if you buy that you are not really gonna be buying you know more than one or like anything else for awhile and i think i mean here there is that sort of like you know he who has the most wins or whatever that you know phrase is and you know there is that with c d is and whatever but i do not know i mean even with the food and everything else i mean it is cheap people buy so much of it like portions are so big because the restaurants can get it more cheaply i mean there you know the portions are a lot smaller it is more expensive you just eat less and i mean you just see it contributing to everything i mean it the obesity problem here and everything else i mean it is getting worse there than it was but i mean it is nowhere is it any where near and that is a large part of the like problem with that people were constantly on me about oh why are americans so fat and like all these things on the television about the americans and i mean that was never ending 

Recording: (530/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (531/ 9621) 
i got a job at at hyde park so that will i mean it is just amazing because the money is so good you know you really can not beat it i only have to work three or four nights a week and it leaves my whole day free for classes and whatever um hyde park grill it is uh it is a restaurant it is up in dublin so i do not know i mean i i did that all through high school and college and after i actually after i graduated from high school i managed a restaurant for about a year and a half 

Recording: (532/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (533/ 9621) 
i look like a college student that would go here so i have never had a problem so we go and do that and like we are planning a road trip we are we we are not we have not decided we are thinking atlantic city or uh florida or new york city or new orleans those the choices we are trying to narrow it down 

Recording: (534/ 9621) 
has to be a long standing kind of thing yeah you know and that that worries me more than um i i understand a lot of the objection is because this is just uh this is opening the door a crack and the next thing you know you know one legal step leads to another legal step and then we will have gay marriage and all those things but i do not think that would be a bad thing either 

Recording: (535/ 9621) 
i do not remember that at all i know how to i know how to do it but i am not sure who taught me how to do it <LAUGH> 

Recording: (536/ 9621)

Recording: (672/ 9621) 
answered an ad in the paper uh but i have sung in a well shawn sings in the symphony chorus too i have sung in it for sixteen years 

Recording: (673/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (674/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (675/ 9621) 
yeah i just renewed my certification certificate last year so i MAY GET BACK INTO IT part of the reason i renewed my certificate was i did some home instruction with the columbus public schools last year and that is kind of like a tutoring job where you can go you can arrange hours with a student that is at home for some reason um i had one that just had a baby <LAUGH> and um they it is an interesting job because they look for somebody that can cover the most technical i guess subject that the student is taking in my case it turned out to be chemistry in one i think chemistry once and i it was the algebra two another time but they expected us to at least expected me uh to cover the other subjects too or at least to spend a little bit of time on them so there was english and there was history <LAUGH> so really requires you to be well rounded <LAUGH> and i i like kind of like that um i have taught in a couple of other places um community colleges the college in newark i taught a chemistry class there and the community college which is in hillsboro but i taught at their branch and i taught a introduction an introduction to ecology class there an introduction to uh introduction to the arts it was called <LAUGH> and that was interesting it was those are it is kind of an underclass of teachers they do not pay you enough to do that they pay you um per student contact hour and in my chemistry class i was teaching i think a total of five or six contact hours a week and they were paying something like twenty one or twenty two dollars an hour <LAUGH> so 

Recording: (676/ 9621) 
but like to some people that is considered a city so i think it is you are perspective inthat sense 

Recording: (677/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (678/ 9621) 
okay it was kind of uh <LAUGH> it was different when i because see because when i went in uh and you know well i never had any problem with a black person or or i did not really care you know as long as they uh did their job and everything i am basically the same way today uh 

Recording: (679/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> yeah 

Recording: (680/ 9621) 
that is not enough <LAUGH> 

Recording: (681/ 9621) 
what they do uh they have like up to four or five months the first four or five months pregnancy they are aloud to maintain once they start to show they do not let them go to the school anymore just for their uh health of the baby 

Recording: (682/ 9621) 
um-hum plus you get so many different students and what i like just walking over here today you know it is kind of thought you know i wonder how many of these people i walk by you know are gonna be here in january because you know a lot of because i did you know i thought well this is cool man you know 

Recording: (683/ 9621) 
yeah i really do not know i do not understand why they do not because to me it is the most important freedom we have and people v um bitch and complain all the time but then when you ask them if they voted they go no it makes no difference well it makes no difference if you do not because your voice was not heard um when i was a political action consultant for the ohio education association i used to go around try to get teachers involved in politics um and one of the things i would tell them is that every vote is important john kennedy won if if if you would take all of the the votes he won by and spread it out across the nation by one vote per per precinct one vote per precinct you know if there had just been one additional vote either way in any of those precincts you know he would have lost uh and so one vote does count and i used to have a list of elections that were decided by one or two votes and when i was with the ohio education association i generally did school levy campaigns and many of them are decided by one two seven eighteen nineteen votes um if i knew the magic reason why people do not vote i could sell that and make a make a fortune um but i do not know what it is 

Recording: (684/ 9621) 
yeah nah because right now you know because he knows how to he is he is learned i would say he knows more than most kindergarteners so i do not even push anything we do not really have a set schedule right now and i am just letting him be creative and you know letting him help around the house and you know just if i let him watch something thats educational based usually and i let him play on the computer we will go to different websites sometimes to check out things and i am amazed sometimes at what he just catches on just from day to day stuff and just listening because he is he listens to EVERYTHING <LAUGH> 

Recording: (685/ 9621) 
yeah yeah but i i have purposely tried to work close or do the back roads it is nice from hilliard you can get almost anywhere whether it be here or you know where i have been working on back roads so it is not that bad 

Recording: (686/ 9621) 
and he said even in the when he was in high school that they had they had police officers there so that is not like a new thing but he said you would have people with like knives and you would have people with fist fights but you like guns was unheard of you know and i think i do not know where this new trend is coming from i think maybe uh they are people feel dejected in high school i am sure of it you know like i do not i i did not feel that way but i would like in retrospect i look back and i thought you know i am thinking maybe those people really felt like horrible and like if every day was like so traumatizing to them like that would be so like for four years every day you are just like teased or something like horrible and you like no one talks to you i am not justifying what they do at all but i am saying that would make them more that would probably in their mind give them the reason 

Recording: (687/ 9621) 
um he does not seem he does not seem to have any problem it is always been you know what ever she WANTS i know so far it is worked out pretty well so you know i am sure in a situation like that things are gonna come up but we will we will deal with it 

Recording: (688/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (689/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah me and my mom are real close 

Recording: (690/ 9621) 
i do i do um art fairs 

Recording: (691/ 9621) 
you know and and it is just i think that that happens so often there are too many people or even that whole thing with bill clinton when you are talking circles around yourself but you never say anything 

Recording: (692/ 9621) 
yeah and i told them i was going to call up the tv station so they could film me crawling out the door as an o s u employee 

Recording: (693/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (694/ 9621) 
i checked my fax machine the next day it says my mother has decided accept your offer and i thought shit i do not THIS ONE what am i gonna do now so i ended up talking him and i i just explained to him that um he would caught me off guard and that i had more time to reconsider it and that because of and it is true because my daughter went to the doctor and the doctor had said that that point the baby could be here in two weeks and that it was just not gonna work for me he is a nice man i felt bad and so then i gave him some ideas about how he could sell it 

Recording: (695/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (696/ 9621) 
all right 

Recording: (697/ 9621) 
well i one thing uh you know being uh uh i came from basically a poor poor uh uh lifestyle uh early life and everything you know so uh um if anything i guess it kind of made me negative uh towards people that had an influence had money and did not do any thing good with it you know i am a firm believer that if you got something that you should share it with other other people i do not always practice what i preach but you know that is i would be a good philosophy to live by uh and people of other religions and everything um you know i learned a lot about religion when i i was raised baptist basically but uh i practice more catholic than anything else now uh but i am generally pretty knowledgeable about judaism and muslims and everything just because i find it interesting 

Recording: (698/ 9621) 
friend who her name was she is not really a friend she was a teacher when i was in college her name was mrs cozy and she got pregnant she said everybody said she came in one day and said it is a girl it is a girl i found out it is a girl what are you gonna name her rosie rosie cozy you have got to be kidding she said i am just putting you on oh 

Recording: (699/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (700/ 9621) 
i do not think it is i do not think it is really affected me i mean obviously there is more places to go shopping or to eat or you there is more traffic LAUGH I do not particularly care much for um but it i do not think it was ever such a small town where it was like everybody knew each other it and it felt like a small community i mean i know in my own neighborhood it is it was where you you went to school with the people once at least once i went to highschool i went to public school 

Recording: (701/ 9621) 
what department 

Recording: (702/ 9621) 
and anymore you are lucky if you know your neighbors because everybody is so busy doing their own thing but as a world i think that everyone has become closer because of the communication that if you do not really actually speak to the people you are hearing about are on tv or radio or via telephone or whatever 

Recording: (703/ 9621) 
very very much so now twenty fifty years ago twenty five to fifty years ago we would call we would tag that description rather than corporation we would tag that as socialism well in the manner we define socialism fifty years ago we are a very very socialistic government uh today we are no longer a democratic government as defined back there then uh yeah we are still democratic according to our new definition of this developed over time uh but it is far more socialistic uh but 

Recording: (704/ 9621) 
and walks away 

Recording: (705/ 9621) 
like stay the heck out of my way here i come it is my world and welcome to it <LAUGH>

Recording: (707/ 9621) 
oh okay 

Recording: (708/ 9621)

Recording: (712/ 9621) 
they do because he just he is all out for himself 

Recording: (713/ 9621) 
but of course whenever they needed a ride or anything like that they come to me 

Recording: (714/ 9621) 
no kids just think oh it can not happen to me i am invincible 

Recording: (715/ 9621) 
hum 

Recording: (716/ 9621) 
unit does it um and it was not that i had a bad family unit it was just that there was not you know we never talked about it my SISTER AND were just talking about that because wewere she goes we were like you know how did people start talking about sex and relationships and what not she goes you do not mom and dad handed me a book i am like they did 

Recording: (717/ 9621) 
we were following his jeep we kept going and we kept going and this other g i and i were sitting in the back and i said hey suppose they know the german PASSWORD <LAUGH> <laughbut> but uh anyway they finally got out we finally out out to where there was a bunch of ruined farm or ruined farm house and farm buildings and so on and uh they said well this is it so uh we there and there were some g i is <error infantry men around there and so uh we started looking around for a place to land i mean got our bed rolls out so on and the next morning i do not know i guess i was looking for a somebody who had a fire there warm up some some uh rice and something anyway one of the first guys i saw was a guy that had worked with my wife in the office there 

Recording: (718/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (719/ 9621) 
yeah he was lucky so 

Recording: (720/ 9621) 
well i think it was then a nice thing about we had uh we had uh grandparents that were not necessarily they were out of state in some cases we did not see them that much we made a part that uh we communicated with the grandparents regularly and when we did it was a special time we um emphasized the fact that um uh you know kids wanna do certain things okay they saw their mother go out and maybe do some additional things to work for that uh the aspect we uh asked them if they wanted to go on um a project with the class so forth fine but you gotta participate in it too we we will match you with what you come up with we made them part of the owner we gave them responsibilities they grew up with the aspect they learned by being around some older people uh which uh i think was good 

Recording: (721/ 9621) 
um yeah 

Recording: (722/ 9621) 
pretty much yeah easy come easy go follow the leader monkey in the middle whatever 

Recording: (723/ 9621) 
i mean i think that is the best way to address it and as far as the homosexual i think there is kids who say well maybe i am gay i do not know if i am gay or what well hopefully they will know their true identity eventually i mean yes some people i mean i know men several men who got married had children and then they decided they were gay okay were they gay before but they did like women 

Recording: (724/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (725/ 9621) 
um currently unemployed um-hum 

Recording: (726/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (727/ 9621) 
you know because that will all go away about second grade 

Recording: (728/ 9621) 
no it uh like i am a business major and i hear the business school here is pretty good so uh i wanted to take a look at that and my roommate is a business major so he he was going to show me around the they have new buildings i guess so he said he would show me around there uh also i i really do like i came down for few games and things like that and i like the enthusiasm that people have for this place like ashland is so small there is a select group that has enthusiasm but nothing like here i mean this is RIDICULOUS everyone is just enthusiastic about the university and even there might be things they do not like specifically about the university there uh i you do not hear any like like universal negative things about this about the university ever 

Recording: (729/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (730/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (731/ 9621) 
to put 

Recording: (732/ 9621) 
and it was just when the drug culture was just you know starting we learned about it in school and stuff but no my parents never sat down with me or about smoking i mean i never really smoked but today with teenagers and everything so out in the open you have to talk to them about things and just say you know i want to help you and i you know be there for them a hundred percent obviously those parents were to busy with their own lives to realize what their children were doing so i think they are the ones to be to blame i do 

Recording: (733/ 9621) 
yeah that was pretty BAD i think they i do not know what happened <LAUGH> 

Recording: (734/ 9621) 
only the can do it i mean seems like with all the technology in the world they should be able to do something like that the people who have guns and in their home and not have them locked up or in a you know in a place that no child could find it they are to blame they are they are to blame um that whole thing with the um school out in colorado um i forget the name of it but yeah but when they said that those boys were making those guns in the garage and the parents did not were clueless i just find that really hard to believe if a child goes in to a garage every night and you hear clanging and and they are buying gun metal and you know then they were totally um not in tune with what their kids were doing it is one thing them having a site on the internet 

Recording: (735/ 9621) 
i i 

Recording: (736/ 9621) 
yeah i have i have plenty of PEOPLE <LAUGH> it is funny jason is mom asks me so is your mom gonna come and stay with YOU FOR A WEEK i said no <LAUGH> i told my mom she started laughing because i i mean of of course uh for her to come over and help out is terrific but if she actually stayed at my house for a week i think we would just kill EACH OTHER 

Recording: (737/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (738/ 9621) 
yeah yeah it might be um-hum um-hum 

Recording: (739/ 9621) 
for parties so because it is actually a market it is all done outside like tonight we are going to the uh galberth pavilion which is um next to the ohio theater it is really beautiful and people do a lot of parties there 

Recording: (740/ 9621) 
yeah it is real it is like the one of the closest bars and we go there because they have a huge patio and so you can just sit out and talk and and then uh we play a lot of board games lately too like we just bought axis and allies me and my roommates 

Recording: (741/ 9621) 
well i grew up with just my mom there she had four kids and i was a very quiet and did very well in school 

Recording: (742/ 9621)

Recording: (743/ 9621) 
credit cards 

Recording: (744/ 9621)

Recording: (745/ 9621) 
um so i just you know was something i was a little familiar with anyway uh i was just looking for something part time 

Recording: (746/ 9621) 
um i guess that would be a slightly different part i am not really sure how big of a problem that is in public schools but mean one being the girl that did get pregnant she ended up going to public school the next year 

Recording: (747/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (748/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (749/ 9621) 
well no actually my mom did not she was a very bad cook 

Recording: (750/ 9621) 
um-hum and that hurt her to go she thought she was letting you know neglecting me i was in 

Recording: (751/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> plus i do not really feel like the republicanpartyrepresents the populace at a whole like at their LAST political convention like in uh the last presidential election in ninety six they said one in ten of the delegates that were attending the convention were millionaires now granted i know more than ten people and not you know what i mean sotomei just feel like that is not a good representation 

Recording: (752/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (753/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (754/ 9621) 
yeah so 

Recording: (755/ 9621) 
and because largely because of the fear of not knowing and not knowing how to deal with the unseen 

Recording: (756/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (757/ 9621) 
i mean dorothy peters obviously been around for a really long time and i uh i would tip i am my views are typically a little bit more democratic but i am not too say that i certainly would not vote um for the person that i thought would do the best job 

Recording: (758/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (759/ 9621) 
um-hum at this point um i am not uh i am not against the urban schools but if it was my own personal child i would not move to a suburban area until columbus gets their act together they are in so uh such bad shape right now that i do think the state will take over the columbus public schools in two years yeah they have threatened it um and if they do not pull their scores up um they will you know 

Recording: (760/ 9621) 
and i have you know i have got a couple in chicago and and i have couple in uh the washington area 

Recording: (761/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (762/ 9621) 
once they turn into adulthood and they feel like going out and shooting people or anything like that i do not think that has anything to do with it 

Recording: (763/ 9621) 
the runaways uh well i think the youngest that i met was maybe twelve but that is you know still young 

Recording: (764/ 9621) 
well you know it because i have to think about how it went back into our income with everything else but i am sure i am sure that i did not pay more than three thousand on it and it you know it did not cost me more than three thousand and so if i had five or six thousand dollars out of it i was happy 

Recording: (765/ 9621) 
i do not know that is kind of a tricky question really because on one hand obviously the kid definitely WILL get uh made fun of and teased and things like that 

Recording: (766/ 9621) 
of the thing is there is things you can not explain 

Recording: (767/ 9621) 
my sister is last name is goodnight and when she had her first little girl she said she was gonna name her dawn ann goodnight but she did not she did not 

Recording: (768/ 9621) 
and 

Recording: (769/ 9621) 
i mean uh i i had parents that everything i did was negative i mean they just told me i could not do this could not do that and and so what i try to do is when anything comes up i always think of how my parents would handle it and i do a hundred and eighty degrees so you know because the you know they just i do not know how i got i sort of feel i am mentally okay now but i do not know how i got here because i have been the other way it hurt me you know and it is well you know 

Recording: (770/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (771/ 9621) 
well i think sometimes that it is because the child has not ever been taught somehow or other or shown i have always been the kind of person to believe i never told my kids not to do something that i myself was doing examples smoking cigarettes or taking a drink of beer or taking a wine with my dinner saying no you are not old enough but i can now there are some things that the kids can not do at this age that somebody can at another age possibly like go out on a date for example well he is going out that party why can not i well he is already sixteen years old now wait till you are sixteen years old and you will be allowed to go to parties because by that time i will expect you be able you know know what to do uh but i mean i never did uh and i know <LAUGH> well i will not give you any examples but anyway if if i told them they could not do it i would try my swearing is one of my bad habits and i know that uh i would try very very hard i got taught one time that i better watch a little more carefully by my one little girl uh but anyway i would always and i would apologize if they did catch me doing something that i have been telling them no you cannot do i would apologize say mommy was bad and mommy did that i got soap in my mouth one TIME BECAUSE I DID THAT <LAUGH> well well um oh no i mean now if you want to hear the story it is funny well deviate just a teeny bit i was baking a pie and i was taking this pie out of the oven it was a cherry pie or an apple pie one those that can get juicy sometimes and i had not put any aluminum foil or anything underneath there to catch it and just as i started to get it out i spilled it and i said a bad word you know and just as i said that word leaning down here here is two little shoes <LAUGH> 

Recording: (772/ 9621) 
the same thing you know i think they are terrific for the right things yeah 

Recording: (773/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (774/ 9621) 
freshman 

Recording: (775/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (776/ 9621) 
heaven forbid but <LAUGH> i am sitting here going i mean i did not even know what i was doing 

Recording: (777/ 9621) 
we sat there then for oh and it was kind of funny we were uh there is another guy and i and the the lieutenant who was forward observer were going out to a forward observation post and they uh observation lieutenant whatever his title was was guiding he was in one jeep ahead of us and we were following him and of course we just had these little red blackout lights they called them 

Recording: (778/ 9621) 
she really likes it well yeah 

Recording: (779/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (780/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (781/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (782/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (783/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (784/ 9621) 
you know well it is just the same as when i was a kid 

Recording: (785/ 9621) 
um-hum got a few ideas um i am thinking i might be a o b g y n just 

Recording: (786/ 9621) 
sitting back waiting 

Recording: (787/ 9621) 
and then but the whole band and the cheerleaders went to his house and he came out crying i mean it was on tv it was like heart wrenching 

Recording: (788/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (789/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (790/ 9621) 
but they said all along they were gay they just fought it and they they did not want the pressure from their families 

Recording: (791/ 9621) 
i think so i think so um it is it is so sad to see a girl you know have so many options closed off now i do not mean it is by any stretch that it is a tragedy to have a baby but um somebody in high school is is making a lot of decisions she does not intend to make 

Recording: (792/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (793/ 9621) 
because uh again i said you bring up you get wisdom from that as long as you are listening to them uh some people i do not care what their age was they just blew them off uh and so that plus you have they i think a understanding of um the schooling they came from um 

Recording: (794/ 9621) 
familiar with sarcom yes <LAUGH> 

Recording: (795/ 9621) 
i do have some relatives that are um step my stepmom is relatives that are there they are actually members of the mormon church 

Recording: (796/ 9621) 
yeah it is um i mean you just know where it goes and you throw it in and there it is you know um let us see what was my decoder card was a little more difficult i had somebody else do it for me 

Recording: (797/ 9621) 
oh good 

Recording: (798/ 9621) 
it ai not that far it is uh 

Recording: (799/ 9621) 
i just can not believe and they said they did not even know what was going on 

Recording: (800/ 9621) 
they are build two hundred thousand dollar houses EVERYWHERE around me 

Recording: (801/ 9621) 
on different topics 

Recording: (802/ 9621) 
i see it working unfairly 

Recording: (803/ 9621) 
i am sure i am sure i am sure i will show you you know welcomes all those dollars but did they have like little like a like a like a wedding industry 

Recording: (804/ 9621) 
a famous one <LAUGH> 

Recording: (805/ 9621) 
i have never heard anybody going on a shooting rampage that were high on pot most of them are sitting home waiting on a pizza 

Recording: (806/ 9621) 
gave me these leading questions and i said uh-huh i know where you are coming from i been confronted with that when i was at ohio state and so forth and um so i just layed it on the line to her 

Recording: (807/ 9621) 
i got on birth control probably when i was like sixteen or seventeen but still i did not take the pills all the time and you know that was not very good FOR ME NEITHER 

Recording: (808/ 9621) 
it is like you know like some of these places in florida kind like ruined by tourists you know like fort lauderdale daytona yeah it is like after after the kids get done <LAUGH> YKNOW THEY JUST LIKE WELL you know forget it it is like i because um i used to when i was in in um like a freshman um i heard i heard like do not even go to florida because like they they do not want students <LAUGH> YKNOW THEY WANT YOUR MONEY but they do not like they do not like your they do not like you know the the trash and and the whatnot that they bring 

Recording: (809/ 9621) 
yeah um-hum 

Recording: (810/ 9621) 
depends on who is the manager is the time every manager is got a different agenda on what is they want you to do 

Recording: (811/ 9621) 
yeah <LAUGH> 

Recording: (812/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (813/ 9621) 
well no she sort of knows this is what she has to say at school if she is asked on a test because she needs the points for a grade 

Recording: (814/ 9621) 
the one girl had um showed her their her ultra sound and then that is when it was like ah it is so cute and like well wait a minute i thought you was against it they are not always against it though 

Recording: (815/ 9621) 
you know we are right there within moments if there is a flood or you know something like that you call the i will be in thursday you know if your air condition so they are always gonna have to have people here so i just feel they are either better to downscale the amount of people they have and get highly qualified people than have twenty people that half of them know what is going on half of them do not so but that is tough to do when you are starting people at eight dollars an hour and stuff so there is you know wendy is MCDONALDS there is places that you can make that money so um-hum my you know to me the thing that hurt me the most out of it is they wanna put caps on our salaries so i am at the highest scale i can go right now as far as job title i there is no other job i can move to until unless i move in to supervision or some up in the and i will be out of the union if i do that anyways so but they are gonna put a cap on that where you can only make so much money at a point which i am almost there right now i am only like fifty cents away from that cap and if that is the case if i retire in six years i will be capped out right now so then in other words i am wanna retire in six years if i do not change jobs making exactly what i make now which that was my worst fear of it all but that was not even on the NEGOTIATING table they were still worried about this two dollars and get this yeah that is what they were fighting for was the low end and did not try to get the hospital and the uh main campus the same 

Recording: (816/ 9621) 
yeah so it is it is a really tough thing to do i mean you hafta be sort of organized and i do not know sort of a maverick i guess because if if you could give a test that would tell who could be an air traffic controller who could not you would be a millionaire because the government would buy that from you because intelligence is not a factor i mean there are people who do this job who i mean are not stupid but they are not college educated and really intelligent but they are extreme good at it and then the other people uh that i know of one that i work with on a regular basis he is got a masters degree and he is you know he reads continuously he is always up i mean if you ask him anything about like what is going on on overseas or anywhere he knows that like the back of his hand but he is one of our weakest ones you know and it is um 

Recording: (817/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (818/ 9621) 
in the way of benefits 

Recording: (819/ 9621) 
my bill collectors are the ones that scared of that 

Recording: (820/ 9621)

Recording: (821/ 9621) 
no i wanted to see her obviously but 

Recording: (822/ 9621) 
oh gosh he just kept saying guess guess guess and i kept saying i do not want to guess this is the first day of got school i lots of stuff to do we do not have time to play guessing games i said spell your last name he said g u e s s <LAUGH> talk about feeling stupid 

Recording: (823/ 9621) 
but to go see something like cats or rent they would still charge you out the butt really okay 

Recording: (824/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (825/ 9621) 
because you gotta trust the people you are around you do not really wanna piss them off 

Recording: (826/ 9621) 
um working on three different um research projects with three different physicians two are um specific to the traumatic brain injury service looking at long term outcomes in people that have sustained traumatic brain injuries the other one is a drug study um looking at control of agitation and the other one is a um spinal cord injury research study 

Recording: (827/ 9621) 
exactly 

Recording: (828/ 9621) 
which is great 

Recording: (829/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (830/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (831/ 9621) 
yeah i think i got really good uh um i have actually been sitting thinking about it like what departments in school were good and which ones were not um the foreign language is really good they have immersion classes from like at second level 

Recording: (832/ 9621) 
again they set different roles 

Recording: (833/ 9621) 
it was not really farming country and he went he went out there from iowa where you throw a kernel of corn out in the field and 

Recording: (834/ 9621) 
they are two elderly women that at the church it this has been about of seven or eight years ago father just mentioned that they had a need uh they had had a church bus and it had broken down so they had a need for to get people to church and i met these two elderly women now the one now is ninety she turned ninety last october and the other one is about eight now and they live together and uh i take them to church on sunday 

Recording: (835/ 9621) 
it might have been where the president lived they sometimes have like a mission home 

Recording: (836/ 9621) 
for whatever reason <LAUGH> yeah yeah 

Recording: (837/ 9621) 
that and i imagine that is about half and half right now or maybe it is more on this side i do not know so i think that that really is uh in evolution at this time tell you the truth what is gonna cause the world to end i think what they really mean by that i hope what they mean by that is that it will end the way it is being run or the way it is being acted out today and that people will be more compassionate toward each other and just be happy and content and i i still think that that has something to do with everybody getting back to really believing there is a god believing that you should take the other person into consideration it might sound very but it is very very hard thing to accomplish especially when you have gotten into this like he said me me me and i gotta have this and that status symbol stuff and really if we older people could get out there maybe and start making speeches somewhere and telling these kids because i know i myself in my own home i have been a collector now i take this back to the depression years when i did not have anything and my father one time when he was out of work guess what i do not know what welfare agency it was but they brought us our christmas dinner and the first doll baby i ever had and i remember when i uh tried to wash the thing off that little doll was one of those that sort of melted in the water and when my mother said well if you do not know how to take care of any better than that i will never buy you another one and believe me she did not 

Recording: (838/ 9621) 
hmm 

Recording: (839/ 9621) 
really <LAUGH> 

Recording: (840/ 9621) 
see there i think there has to be a quality to life too and 

Recording: (841/ 9621) 
and it makes you a a better person because you got the spirituality inside you driving you and that is what is gonna take you home i often ask of people uh you ask me about marketing 

Recording: (842/ 9621) 
like and the of is all those little words you are already supposed to know those you are supposed to be able to write a sentence even if it is just a little short sentence like my name is joanne i live at blah blah blah street i mean it is incredible it is like the curriculum keeps moving down and down and down 

Recording: (843/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (844/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (845/ 9621)

Recording: (855/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (856/ 9621) 
west side

Recording: (871/ 9621) 
and unfortunately they have to do what the people with the pets say but it is just i could not be around that and then you know i would go off on people that would do that bring that in i just feel that would be the right thing to do punch them in the mouth SOMETIMES ah i am not a violent man either even as big as i am you know you know 

Recording: (872/ 9621) 
better than us i guess <LAUGH>

Recording: (891/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (892/ 9621) 
um as far as affiliated with a party i probably respond to um republicans more than democrats but i think given any um given any choice of any party at all i am probably more libertarian than anything else 

Recording: (893/ 9621) 
um-hum so when he uh was a junior then he started in high school he started really seriously thinking i gotta get it together what am i gonna do so he uh agreed to go to psychiatrist and uh so he went on ritalin uh so he took the ritalin through his last of his junior year and his senior year now he is on a medication they call uh wellbutrin his doctor um does not believe in ritalin 

Recording: (894/ 9621) 
yeah it was painful but no worse than going to the hospital for my back surgery my back surgery was worse than a heart attack ever was 

Recording: (895/ 9621) 
and these people that hear voices they are not hallucinating they are hearing voices of spirits and in many cultures they will tell you most the indigenous cultures throughout the world will tell you and the history will show that those people were revered as gifted 

Recording: (896/ 9621) 
um weekends i usually try and keep free so that i can make stuff up um and uh i do not know because of the usually the the one night a week that is not horribly well scheduled wednesday nights are preparing for travel 

Recording: (897/ 9621) 
some places you are allowed to wear sandals and 

Recording: (898/ 9621)

Recording: (902/ 9621) 
this these uh the it has uh setup where um they have safe places where kids can go when they run away 

Recording: (903/ 9621) 
um honestly i can not say it really bothers me too much um i mean as far as just dealing with gay people or whatever it does not bother me at all it is just something i do not wanna deal with or whatnot um so i mean the fact that i mean two people of the same sex are living together married or whatnot that does not bother me like i said it is just more something that i do not know it does definitely make me uncomfortable out in public or something if i see like two guys holding hands or whatnot it is i think it is just more because it is so different than like what you NORMALLY SEE OR things like that 

Recording: (904/ 9621) 
can not you can not explain that and those have been questions that i have been asked by my our children how would you mom and dad oh gee i how do you well hey that is a that is one of the risks in life marriage but the thing is do you wanna make it work 

Recording: (905/ 9621) 
no humans are violent by nature i believe mean people have been at war since the beginning of man it is more or less greed that causes violence it is not media media just like the ecstasy was an advertisement showing what you could do tv is showing you violence that you could do if you are driven to it 

Recording: (906/ 9621) 
that it is still really going on you know and his parents accepted him 

Recording: (907/ 9621) 
no with the system 

Recording: (908/ 9621) 
you know they all get uh side lined and side tracked by special private interests and that is that is the bottom line and it is sad but there is so i choose not to involve myself in that as much as possible we ended up settling for 

Recording: (909/ 9621)

Recording: (932/ 9621)

Recording: (943/ 9621) 
yeah they are very quantitative as opposed to like the quality and then so the analysis is all about bottom line and the numbers because actually that is why i do not like like i like business and i i enjoy my business classes but some of the people in my business classes i can not stand because they honestly they are like oh it does not matter how you treat people and then it is all about the bottom line well they will in my opinion they will end up losing more because it costs a lot to hire a new employee and if you have constant turnover things like that then and if you have a product and that because obviously people are not gonna care you know so and they they are they seem very closedminded like like this is the way business has to be but the professors do not seem to be necessarily like that maybe i am coming too far going to one extreme

right 

Recording: (985/ 9621) 
and how do you picture it 

Recording: (986/ 9621) 
i do not that i think that that what they were protesting was that they were not being involved in it was not that part of their protest 

Recording: (987/ 9621) 
oh yes they are getting better though they really are they are much better now than they were twenty years ago because the trend is to keep these students in the mainstream as much as possible so teachers are having to learn to for example

Recording: (999/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1000/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1001/ 9621)

Recording: (1018/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1019/ 9621) 
oh not very right on and i would twenty the twenty years the first twenty years i worked at the bureau i was worked in statistics so i learned a lot about numbers and how to use them and what you can do with them how easily they are misinterpreted and my wife does it it has been a director of institutional research at the university um data research uh uh they do not really have other kinds of research there um 

Recording: (1020/ 9621) 
you know or a conversation piece you know or some kind of trophy well here is my here is my dog my labrador ah yeah full and uh a lot of these people were uh the dogs were reacting in a they were objective you know and they were because they were not being paid attention to and they were pissing on the carpet and making messes and chewing things up and and these people would bring them in and uh uh have them put to sleep 

Recording: (1021/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> so that is why she is trying to get it out of the way now because you know the the the husband he makes you know fairly decent money so you know she does not have to work right now but in order for them to move up the way they want to move up you know after the baby comes she will need to work i have custody of another grandchild uh my son when he was in high school had a girl no a little girlfriend and she was uh see he was tenth grade and she was ninth grade i guess she uh had a baby and uh believe my son was in eleventh grade when the baby was born and uh she had a lot of problems running away from home and uh she is uh you know well my son left to move into the dorm here at o s u and she uh moved in with me i think the baby was fifteen months old and i tried to help the young lady and it just turned out that the you know the young lady was not ready to be a mother my son would not even now is not ready to be a father so uh there was a you know whole investigation through childrens services and uh they gave me custody of the child temporarily and she is still there and she is four and a half the mother is married and has another child now and and the the little one is still with me 

Recording: (1022/ 9621) 
well no they do not 

Recording: (1023/ 9621) 
not as an individual uh well see that is a problem it is hard to find a balance between censorship and you know free flow of information uh and as long as people i mean some people like this information uh jerry springer is still running <LAUGH> which i i actually kind of enjoy watching ONCE IN A WHILE when i get the it is kind of interesting to watch these um but i mean i mean where do you draw the line what people should see and not see i do not know i do not want somebody telling me i can see something or telling me what my kids can see uh i that is my job and if i do not wanna see something on tv i will turn it off if i do not want my kids to see something on tv we will i have an argument it used to be easy when they were little you know now <LAUGH> you know you are dealing with a a twenty one year old an eighteen year old is not as easy 

Recording: (1024/ 9621) 
for like summer project or something

Recording: (1028/ 9621) 
if they wanna get married that is their business i do not think its mine or anyone else to say that they can not 

Recording: (1029/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (1030/ 9621) 
i think more of along the lines of like physical abuses things like that um would be probably crossing the line um like if he got there were alleges uh excuse me he was allegedly beating his wife or something like that OBVIOUSLY then yeah then that would cause a problem with me i would i can not say that i would vote for anyone like that but i mean just like small things like that where it does not really threaten the nation or anything and i mean it is something that happened 

Recording: (1031/ 9621) 
and i have one at northland highschool she is a sophomore there and the one at o u is a freshman and uh i am married and uh what else i live in uh northeast columbus by seventy one and one sixty one and that is about it 

Recording: (1032/ 9621)

Recording: (1033/ 9621) 
exactly 

Recording: (1034/ 9621) 
getting married having kids you know and having a nice place to live 

Recording: (1035/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (1036/ 9621)

Recording: (1039/ 9621) 
people graduate get degrees from ohio state working here taking one course a one course a quarter and get a degree in history or whatever it might take them to ten years or something you know but it is like why not it is free

Recording: (1044/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah 

Recording: (1045/ 9621) 
but i have been in situations where people have told racist jokes and sometimes i let it pass because you do have to pick the time to to challenge someone very carefully but in other situations i have said i do not find those types of jokes funny please do not tell them anymore in my presence do what you want when you are with your other friends but do not do it in front of me i do not even like blonde jokes i find those sexist and um racist in a way and i i no one will tell them to me one day when i was still working in an office there were telling fifteen or twenty of them in a row and i just kept a stone face but at one or two i did KIND OF SMILE but they were trying to get me to laugh but i would not but um 

Recording: (1046/ 9621) 
eh 

Recording: (1047/ 9621) 
okay how do you do how do you get back to the original without being part of the original 

Recording: (1048/ 9621) 
i think a lot of people do not understand a lot of people do not it is a mindset uh uh they do not wanna deal with numbers a lot of people or they want something easy and simple and that is what they are looking for they do not really wanna know what it means uh and a statistic under any uh any definition really is nothing more than an average of some kind 

Recording: (1049/ 9621) 
yeah it was like freshman or sophomore year 

Recording: (1050/ 9621) 
while while poohpoohing everything and saying this is dumb and stuff as as far as bringing the two together like socially i think that is just a rough age 

Recording: (1051/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1052/ 9621) 
i can ARGUE BOTH SIDES of that i am at a luxury i guess where we are at a position where i i truly do not have to work so if i ever felt that he was in jeopardy or he was not getting what he wanted or needed i would quit in a heartbeat to to to take care of that but having family with him the first year and a half um i do not know i got all my schooling everything out of the way i cut down to the sixty percent when he was born to have more time with him um i do not know it is a whole different society with emails and the uh computer and the internet and the cell phones i mean it is in some regards it is much more connected but so impersonal and i think i do not know mom is being outside the home i think so many families are forced to do that with the cost and is it the cost or is it the wants it is the very material society right now but it is also a very um good economical time too the stock market overall is been up i know it is down right now but overall so the money is been flying and houses and buildings and 

Recording: (1053/ 9621) 
yeah i would i would say you know life application things would definitely need to be part of it i do not think that you should throw out english or math or you know can not believe i am saying this history but <LAUGH> i do not think you should throw out that stuff but i do not think that there should be as much emphasis on it i think more of the emphasis should be on life skills and just being able to make it on you are own and take care of yourself and but definitely i think that those other 

Recording: (1054/ 9621) 
you know i mean it was just like and then it also put a mark on you to go somewhere else so you would never wanna you know ever say anything but um yeah that 

Recording: (1055/ 9621) 
oh yeah well i do not know <LAUGH>

Recording: (1078/ 9621) 
um if you are going to do something like that you better at least KNOW the risks involved into it and what exactly you are doing before you do anything like that 

Recording: (1079/ 9621) 
because they f always dress up and everything when they go to the bars 

Recording: (1080/ 9621) 
so we had a lot of time together and she says she thinks that was worth it 

Recording: (1081/ 9621) 
oh yeah yeah right and you know what is gonna happen it is only when it gets so bad that they can not even walk to their car they can not even go to to the store without being affected by that they can not say that anymore you know it is the people that if i do not see it it is not there they are the ones that are gonna be the most shocked and they are the ones that are gonna be panicked when everything you know because it is getting smaller the world is getting smaller we are we are more populated now than we ever have been so people need to learn to work together and to be together and 

Recording: (1082/ 9621) 
uh because i was not allowed to wear jeans i was not allowed to wear tennis shoes 

Recording: (1083/ 9621)

Recording: (1084/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (1085/ 9621) 
oh so there is so that is like that is 

Recording: (1086/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (1087/ 9621) 
and uh then they powers that be you know american army decided well we will go up to this little area of uh oh i was there six months or four months anzio 

Recording: (1088/ 9621)

Recording: (1091/ 9621) 
so hey 

Recording: (1092/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> you know we my husband and i were just talking about this i was saying i am not in for the you know george orwell nineteen eighty four and big brother syndrome at all um my ideal situation would be that somebody decides who should have kids and who is not but i do not think god is gonna come down and do that SO WELL YKNOW WHAT I MEAN we can not really decide that but to be honest i am for it um it does not have to be well i am not even sure tubes tied is is pretty permanent um but even if they could do something like on a yearly basis and give them two hundred dollars a year that is still not still much cheaper than them having kids um and then if they i would give more money if they would clean up their act just for them um as far as it being racist i do not think i think they are missing the the point because i am sure there is some runaway white teenage girls out there too or mexican or what not um 

Recording: (1093/ 9621) 
i got him sounds like i bought a dog 

Recording: (1094/ 9621) 
yeah we lived um we moved about five or six years ago um and the house we had before was some big like eighty ninety year old house 

Recording: (1095/ 9621) 
yeah i got a son he is a senior at otterbein 

Recording: (1096/ 9621) 
i was reading a thing though in uh the u s a i think it was yesterday where uh your uh minority and your your uh uh majority you know uh it is always been that well you know they were trying to make it seem like it is different it is always but like you know like the army has always been forty percent uh minority and sixty percent or something like that you know that uh airforce has always been uh like seventy thirty or something like that you know because the standards are a little bit higher to get in and a lot of people do not want to get into that you know they do not want to take them tests and everything you know uh my uh a cousin that was a uh spent twenty five years i think in the army because that is he could have done better but that is all he wanted to do you know be a drill sergeant and stuff like that you know but uh i just think a lot lot of times the media 

Recording: (1097/ 9621) 
you know so it is uh you know if if you have a problem if you wanna talk to somebody well if if somebody you know personally does not they know somebody 

Recording: (1098/ 9621) 
you know not that what you wear makes you but he just he is a good role model 

Recording: (1099/ 9621) 
exactly 

Recording: (1100/ 9621) 
well i thought about that you know i mean doing something in the animal area even as a vet assistant but um with domestic animals um 

Recording: (1101/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1102/ 9621) 
uh-huh and then when i got my masters no i did it no i did it during um the weekends and the summers and the nights and took me about mm well i started teaching in nineteen seventy seventy one 

Recording: (1103/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1104/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1105/ 9621) 
yeah i guess i am just so secure about who i am that i do not have a problem with it and i was in the men is glee club for a while so there is a small percentage of the people in there that are you know that that are gay as well and that is and and i really made friends with a lot of them i guess uh i mean i guess it is just because of my personality i i i really do not know what it is but apparently something in my personality calls out to them and says come hey you can be my friend i am cool i am all right even though i am not even though i am not one of you i can still be your friend which is sort of what i try and emanate because i am i am very very religious and it is the christian community is very is i am not gonna say can be i say they are christian community is very very mean towards homosexuals and that is just not right i mean they are people they are making a mistake in in my eyes yes but that does not mean i am going look at them any differently as human beings they deserve my respect oh yeah but i see everyone as engaging in sinful behavior because in my in my religion everyone sins um i am a i am a christian i go to a non denominational church yeah i do not like denominations i am not 

Recording: (1106/ 9621) 
it is a lot easier to market yourself 

Recording: (1107/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1108/ 9621) 
yeah uh he he and three other people well a lot of them had signed the union they have to have almost everybody sign for it but um he was one of the people that had really been yes and so he fired him but not for that because you can not do that it is illegal so he but he sent a form letter with everybody it was exactly the same to the three people that were fired except for their names were changed for the these like basically made up reasons 

Recording: (1109/ 9621) 
yeah i have two other sisters um one of them is well it is funny because we are all divorced out the five of us we are all on one of them is on her third marriage and we are all on our second except for one she is divorced and she has not remarried and then my oldest that i told you in akron i guess she is not remarried 

Recording: (1110/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1111/ 9621) 
she is the type of person i love to annoy 

Recording: (1112/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1113/ 9621) 
but she is yelling at everybody is prejudice against her and i got to sit there and shut my mouth and do her work 

Recording: (1114/ 9621) 
NO THATS not what i mean no i do not i do not mean it that way but i just mean i think i think it is better that if people are are get to a point where they can not work it out i mean i think that that a lot of times you can do things like counseling and those types of things and and maybe there is some way to work it out 

Recording: (1115/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (1116/ 9621) 
you be sleeping on the beach before you shell out that kind of bucks 

Recording: (1117/ 9621) 
i do not understand that 

Recording: (1118/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1119/ 9621) 
uh essentially all the big academics most the uh it is actually all over the world it is international 

Recording: (1120/ 9621) 
uh she was through with her pregnancy but she did end up just going to a public school 

Recording: (1121/ 9621) 
oh yeah um-hum it is the biggest thing 

Recording: (1122/ 9621) 
i have seen the um big amphitheater and with that uh the what is that the opera house yeah right right on the right on there was the ocean or whatever it is gorgeous 

Recording: (1123/ 9621) 
i would say it is not any different than having a man i mean it is a person she would just have a different way of going about it probably 

Recording: (1124/ 9621) 
yeah and uh i had the prerogative i coulda gone somewhere else and made more money you know but well what the bad part was is university is trying to do away with civil service civil service is a good thing and a bad thing you know you do you had step raises and everything so it least you did have an increase back then nowadays you have nothing 

Recording: (1125/ 9621) 
yeah <LAUGH> that is it <LAUGH> 

Recording: (1126/ 9621) 
well i was uh i i was pretty well established about responsibility and that sort of thing before i went into service i was the oldest son in a family of ten 

Recording: (1127/ 9621) 
without going into too much detail um one of my best friends from high school well he stayed at home and i went off to columbus and i found an amazing church down here and learned a lot and and really stumbled across a lot of interesting doctrine and theological beliefs and i believe that stuff now and he does not and he feels actually strongly that anyone who believes that is like a heretic and he just went off to alaska with another friend of ours and before he left for alaska i actually took the time to to uh i did not want to but he was sort of pushing me into it because we were iming each other and uh he sort of pushed me into it a little bit and i told him you know i am like a lot of the stuff that you have talked about uh you know talked about not liking i believe and i and i told him i said i can i can understand if in our minds there is a problem but we accept the fact that the other person is wrong and leave it at that but that is not what you are thinking you are thinking you are looking at me and you are knowing within your mind he is evil he is wrong and i said that is not right dude i i honestly do not know uh people get really scared there is certain i mean like there is certain denominations that will take one it is sort of like the outer limits they will take one book or one scripture out of the bible and expand it to crystal clarity and they will just run with it and that is what my mom came out of um her her denomination that she came out of she is not part of it any more denomination she came out of it um some of the more devout churches within the apostolic christian church we are talking men sit on one side women sit on the other women wear little thingies on their heads no jewelry the sermon is read in three different languages some really wacky stuff 

Recording: (1128/ 9621) 
you know the only thing that really really saved my son i think from getting into any kind of trouble or anything was he was so involved in sports 

Recording: (1129/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1130/ 9621) 
no no but he has a daughter and that was from high school um his girlfriend yeah i got pregnant and then he stayed with her and they tried to work things out and they never got married and that was when you lived in canada so she lives in canada now and he goes you know he talks to her all the time and then they are real open about that i mean she is real good about letting the little girl come and she will stay the summerwith us and you know he will drive up there and see her too 

Recording: (1131/ 9621) 
like i told ya i can be an idiot 

Recording: (1132/ 9621) 
wow so is you pretty much have to be you know can not be middle class in new york have to be have to be rich or you are not 

Recording: (1133/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1134/ 9621) 
no no SHE WA <LAUGH> 

Recording: (1135/ 9621) 
no he did not he did not 

Recording: (1136/ 9621) 
unless you get stuck in traffic 

Recording: (1137/ 9621) 
nobody oh she is really plain smart i MEAN 

Recording: (1138/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah mm i think it could have i thought she would get a better education out there uh now at saint louis school public school district she probably district she probably would have had the same as here but by being kirkwood you know and relatively small and everything um i think we maybe had uh a hundred and some kids in our graduating class you know so uh i felt i got better attention when i wanted it you know uh then i would have at a at a bigger school 

Recording: (1139/ 9621) 
yeah i mean getting a gun does not i mean i was surprised like i would i have never owned a gun but i am i think it is pretty easy to get one ACTUALLY 

Recording: (1140/ 9621) 
i think it is really you really have to be careful who you put on the medication and how much you put them on and how long they stay on it and and most kids do not like being on medication because it makes them different they do not look at it like gee i am really lucky i live in a day and time when there is a pill to help me concentrate they look it like well none of my friends have to do it so why do i have to do it you know <LAUGH> they look at it like it is a big pain because they gotta run over to the nurse and get their pill at lunch and generally the long acting they are time released ones there is only a couple of them a couple of the different medications that are out in the time release and they only work for about forty percent of population most people try the time release and it wears off and it does not do what it is supposed to so they go back to the six hour dosage you know one in the morning one at lunch and then their friends all know that they have to go get their pill and then they are late to the lunch line and you know they just hate it so but it is not something they can a lot of kids will not i guess they are in denial just like we would be they say it does not help me i do not need it but when you sit down and say okay what are the things you are able to do when you are on it that you really have trouble with when you are off of it and they see it in black and white they go oh yeah 

Recording: (1141/ 9621) 
i think so yeah like their haircuts are a certain way and can not you have to shave and um you always have to have your tie and your jacket if you can unless it is really hot there is it is different also depending on the climate 

Recording: (1142/ 9621) 
and that is true um so that is the most powerful thing i can do when i can turn it over to god and say god this is too damn big for me to handle you think you can work on maybe helping change this person is heart or their mind because i can not do that um so you know i did not mean to get OFF ON A TANGENT THERE 

Recording: (1143/ 9621) 
when i did school levy campaigns uh and a couple of other campaigns to me the biggest thing is is what the the campaign does on election day called get out the vote that is the most important thing that can be done um i used to always at the beginning of a a campaign for a school levy get a list of all the registered voters and of course i had a very limited population in a school district and i would have the school district compare it to parents and the first thing i would do is register parents because many of them do not vote uh and i read a study somewhere that the average person in this country does not even begin to vote until they are forty if i had known that when i was in college and worked so hard to get the vote changed to eighteen because i could not vote till i was twenty one and i was upset you know because i wanted to vote for certain candidates because of the vietnam war that was a big issue and i could not uh i had to wait till i was twenty one so there were a bunch of us at college that you know worked and did some volunteer work to get that whole thing changed if i would known that they were not gonna vote at eighteen and they were gonna wait until they were almost forty i would not of i would not of wasted my time um but anyway um you get parents who are usually younger especially of the the first second third grade age 

Recording: (1144/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1145/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1146/ 9621) 
and then it is different businesses like white castle or pizza one of the pizza places and uh some of the supermarkets and things and they are advertised you know throughout the community so these kids when they have problems they might wanna go to huckleberry house and they do not have a way so they go to a safe house and they call and they have a you know group of volunteers would go out and pick these kids up take them to huckleberry house which is not far from here so i did that for a while but uh was not very uh satisfying because i really did not feel like they were doing anything to really help the kids at huckleberry house 

Recording: (1147/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1148/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1149/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1150/ 9621) 
well i am saying on the whole world i they are and everybody is so busy now with all the things that they have to do even me i think that maybe he is found it the same way but maybe NOT AS MUCH as i have i thought when i retired i was gonna get this done and this done and this done AND i wonder now how i went to work and still got SOME OF THESE THINGS DONE <LAUGH> WHEN I GOT HOME and i am sure i am doing it just as fast because over and over again people say i have never seen anybody with as much energy you are always doing something but and i think it is just that we do not have the time 

Recording: (1151/ 9621) 
oh sure 

Recording: (1152/ 9621) 
right so they do not come see me and i guess i should not care because i i would just like them actually what i would like them is come for about twenty minutes so they can see this wonderful home we have that is all i care about i just wanna show it off 

Recording: (1153/ 9621) 
yeah it is a lot smaller than columbus though 

Recording: (1154/ 9621) 
and i think there is an article this last wednesday in the dispatch in business section as to how the p u c o can not regulate it and because of it they want to deregulate telecommunications uh and so for the past months we have not been getting telephone bills for usage we have the backbone we are paying for and what is going to happen out of this whole thing is it offers us a a a a lot of latitude where with uh we can now um if we have a contractor lets say over in dayton and we are calling from zanesville office i would rather make them long distance we can go on our pipe and if we have a line going over dayton we can make that call as if it is a local call avoiding all long distance 

Recording: (1155/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1156/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1157/ 9621) 
do you have one now 

Recording: (1158/ 9621) 
kind of balance the brother out a little bit <LAUGH> 

Recording: (1159/ 9621) 
um i do not really think there is any huge difference um i can say from what i have seen the people that went to the catholic schools um they are a little bit more disciplined and know how to like organize their time better and things like that like i mean most of my friends have gone to the public schools are <LAUGH> really overwhelmed by the amount of stuff that they have to do here 

Recording: (1160/ 9621) 
yeah i mean i guess so i mean i always spent the weekends with my dad and i spent the week with them 

Recording: (1161/ 9621) 
uh like because there is not like like a a like a defined lead lead person because just one person doing it most of the most of time i mean like people do have groups that play like techno beat oriented music but it is not like a lead singer who like you know is like that it is not like that at all 

Recording: (1162/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1163/ 9621) 
it is extremely difficult to deal with 

Recording: (1164/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1165/ 9621) 
oh yeah we have probably been five six times already and 

Recording: (1166/ 9621) 
talk to him like you know this be nice dan um 

Recording: (1167/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1168/ 9621) 
um not really i mean i have been with a few people that have just i mean just randomly gotten kind of jumped i mean they did not steal anything they just beat them up for no reason or what not 

Recording: (1169/ 9621) 
yeah i was cutting twenty pounds in three days 

Recording: (1170/ 9621) 
white women who had actually had it done than uh than um hispanic or african american but i do not know at least in that case i mean before we were talking about the government i mean at least in that case there still is a choice i mean there is money involved but it is it is not so much money that it would radically change your life in a sort of you know it is not thousands of dollars if it was two hundred i believe and and that is you know i mean if if that amount of money is going to sway you in that direction i do not know i think you know there is the debate about ten years down the line but you know is there going to be something that is going to make them change you know what is it you know what is it going to be and like how how realistic is it for you know what percentage i mean i do not know anything about the sort of statistics of people who do clean up their act or anything like that but i mean i do think if there is that element of choice it is a lot different than you know the government saying okay this is your cut off limit but i mean the statistics they were giving on um the average number of children that these women were having and you know you know the average number of children that were just taken to the hospital and left there or you know just dropped off wherever and and the state these children were in and their lifespan and everything else i mean you know there is the human rights for the mother but what about the human rights for the the child is life you know i mean i think all that is forgotten about in so many of these cases and you know the same is in england yeah everyone saying oh because they were talking about you know i mean again was just an idea they were kicking around but sort of you know somehow sort of forcing these young girls to at least be on birth control you know in whatever way and and again that everyone was up in arms but it is sort of like you know what is that child is quality of life gonna be when their mothers just you know 

Recording: (1171/ 9621) 
it took us ten years to have and i think my mom genuinely thought i was doing birth control and we were not but you always knew the subtle undertones undertones you know is she or is not she it was just like well i am not gonna discuss it with her because i knew that was a no no to her but i was not but she did not need to know THAT 

Recording: (1172/ 9621) 
and too much prejudice there really is still and it is sad but it there really is 

Recording: (1173/ 9621) 
because now they are getting to the age where they are fighting more and you know and you got a boy and a girl and you know it is 

Recording: (1174/ 9621) 
i know 

Recording: (1175/ 9621) 
and what they would say about americans and american culture like at that discussion group you know in front of you you know so 

Recording: (1176/ 9621) 
one thing okay go head well i one thing um i was thinking you know that i have a perspective on that maybe lots lots of people do not is how columbus has grown up 

Recording: (1177/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1178/ 9621) 
so and i figured i have a hundred up to a hundred and fifty four credits and so i am to i am up to like ninety four right now and i figured that would be a decent i mean it translates over because we are on semesters it will get all messed up there but it is it is like i am half way to three fourths done with uh with my degree so if i wanted to transfer now would be like because i after this point if i stay any longer a lot of the credits will not transfer over it would be a waste of time because most places do not like to take more than half so that is why i just figure right now i should look 

Recording: (1179/ 9621) 
i mean just like beauty and the beast there is extreme amount of violence in there uh you know just every one there is a a bad dark side in the story so children just are and i mean it is in their and then including my own daughter she and i would swear i had her watch mister ROGERS ALL THE TIME <LAUGH> but now that she is older she watches tv she is addicted to tv something terrible and then so of course her children are uh so but i think you know i was i did not have HAVE tv when i was a child child and i think you know it it stimulates the imagination in some ways but i do not know what direction that imagination really goes you know and but there is a tremendous amount of violence in front of everybody is face anymore as matter of fact i am getting so i do not watch the news 

Recording: (1180/ 9621) 
henderson olentangy 

Recording: (1181/ 9621)

Recording: (1187/ 9621) 
well i i i think we we oh yeah we are we are church goers but just be going church goers is not uh is not being faithful i think it is just a sharing yourself uh with one another in daily lives uh listening to someone outreaching to someone whatever it might be that is the the ministry that uh i think our our our lord has given us 

Recording: (1188/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1189/ 9621)

about uh thirteen years i think my dad uh once he got through with his residency and everything we moved to mansfield and he joined a practice and we have been living there ever since um mansfield is about i would say fifty five sixty thousand people and ashland is probably about twenty five to thirty thousand people but um mansfield is sort of fascinating to <LAUGH> per capita murder rate in mansfield is higher than anywhere else in in ohio <LAUGH> YEAH um it is just it is very industrialized there is the there is a lot of um a certain community that lives there that normally would not live in a smaller city like that there is just a lot of there is a lot of crime in mansfield um there is a steel factory there is a uh not really there is all sorts of there is all sorts of of um industry in the mansfield area but there is a lot of it no actually most of it most of it stayed most of it stayed it is it is been there for a while yeah we have got the mansfield state reformatory where shawshank redemption was where shawshank redemption was recorded yep yep well i do not know if that is our claim to fame but but we do we do have that in mansfield but um ashland is a little bit more and a little bit more of what mat affects a lot more locates more of a it is more of a um agricultural county um ashland city is right where i live it is you know i mean we are like five minutes outside of ashland city but ashland city is the county seat for ashland county and um mansfield is the county seat for richland county yeah but everybody does everything in mansfield because there is nothing to do in ashland but uh the mansfield branch campus for o s u is there well growing up in mansfield was um uh yeah it was really boring it was really boring um my dad was just getting himself settled into the community and and with his job and everything my mom stayed home so she stayed with us for a while um most of my early childhood memories are from where where we lived in mansfield it was uh it was a real it was a real do not talk do not ask community mean you really did not know your neighbors unless you went over and said hi they never came over so yeah yeah yeah we lived in a suburban area of mansfield sort of like the uh the the white collar area where all the people who were business men were getting themselves established so and then um we switched churches and also my dad opened up he he and his partner opened up another uh branch office in ashland so we moved to the ashland area about about eight years ago almost nine years ago and we moved to ashland to get half way between um dad is my dad is not centrally located between the ashland office the hospital that is in ashland the hospitals that are in mansfield he is about he said it is about a twenty minute drive from all the places he needs to be um actually yeah we live on an we live on an now we live on an eighty acre farm yeah we have gotten a nice big house a barn some tractors no animals well we have got a dog but but um it is it is a farm in the sense that we have got a barn we have got tractors we lease we lease some of the land out to a a farmer who who actually works in plants stuff no not to be on a farm no my dad is a doctor <LAUGH> i

Recording: (1235/ 9621) 
no because i think there is the ideal in everything and if you can not live up to that ideal standard but you do the best you can do and uh i think that is where i was coming from i mean even now um i mean i i could never agree with abortion lets say i i would stand by the church and and most most of the church laws i do stand by but i guess the birth control issue became so personal and um it was just a decision that had to be made and i had to make it with a what i felt was a clear conscience and what i did i do not have any regrets for it what about you 

Recording: (1236/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1237/ 9621) 
well yeah it is i just give you a rough estimate of uh two and a half miles from here

Recording: (1239/ 9621) 
um-hum um-hum right 

Recording: (1240/ 9621) 
hate crime is a is an is an interesting term um all crimes all murders are hate related i uh i am not sure it that is uh it it is difficult i we had civil rights laws many people were opposed to those but it was uh in an effort to correct years of institutionalized racism um and and maybe something like that is needed to stop years of institutionalized hate but a crime is a crime and you know are you going to give someone who murdered matthew shepard six life terms as opposed to someone who murders someone else one life term i mean murder is murder and there is already a a law on the books so i do not think we need to have a hate crime over and above that you know uh the the people who murdered matthew shepard should be tried and hopefully convicted on the facts and should not have anything else added into it i i think doing that is going to do the same thing that the many of the civil rights and the uh affirmative action programs and the busing did to people it is going to turn people against uh gays like it turned people against blacks for a while although ultimately i think it did make a difference i i had a i have a black friend at the ohio education association who was very active in the sixties in uh opening up restaurants in the south and marching and you know going to you know opening the schools in the south and i said to her one day are you disappointed that things are not better uh you know that people still hate blacks this was ten fifteen years ago and she said no she said that was not my goal my goal was not to change hearts and minds my goal was to change behavior and the behavior changed except now i never thought i would live to see an all white jury convict white men of of killing a black man we are in hearts and minds now 

Recording: (1241/ 9621) 
yeah it is 

Recording: (1242/ 9621)

Recording: (1249/ 9621)

Recording: (1252/ 9621) 
it was uh part of the time 

Recording: (1253/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (1254/ 9621) 
yeah there was just something about that sting far better far more than a paddle paddle was kind of a whop and then was end up with a sting and it kind of got your attention and then you appeals appeals 

Recording: (1255/ 9621) 
right right but that helped me just getting away getting my mind cleared doing a little bit of reading going wait a minute you know uh <LAUGH> ITS so obvious hello <LAUGH> but <LAUGH> oh yeah 

Recording: (1256/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1257/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1258/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> uh-huh 

Recording: (1259/ 9621) 
yeah i was i was driving by the the honking and everything so yeah my roommates and i got into a a debate about it but it we did not really resolve it 

Recording: (1260/ 9621) 
and even if you had two full bloods from two different tribes and they had a child the federal government still considers them a half blood 

Recording: (1261/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (1262/ 9621) 
um actually i was over there when all of that happened but of course it was all over the papers and you know i think i mean i i would i do not know what it was like really here i can imagine but i mean there especially they really focused on um not columbine but the one with the the younger kids in arkansas was it the year before i was there for both of those but you know in the first one you know they they put the picture of the little kid in combat gear holding the gun everywhere and columbine you know every paper had a slightly different slant on the story and you know their facts were all over the place but that is another kind of issue but um what i think caused it i mean i do not know i think that like more should have been made of the fact of you know this like terrible sort of resentment for the other students and and you know i am not in any way defending the guys who did it but um you know something is wrong not only with them but in the fact that they were like driven to that point where they felt so hated and so maligned or whatever that you know that you would even think of doing something like that um i do not know especially with you know everything that was said about the families and you know they did not seem to of course you never really know but they did not seem to have grown up in this you know terrible environment and you know have that sort of you know preconditioned or anything like that um yeah i think a lot more effort needs to be made you know to sort of you know placate those sort of situations and i mean who does it is sort of another question because you know the teachers already are over worked and underpaid and you know all those kind of things but i do not know 

Recording: (1263/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> <LAUGH> OKAY <LAUGH> YEAH REALLY <LAUGH> aw 

Recording: (1264/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (1265/ 9621) 
eighty eight so we we just had our eleventh wedding anniversary yeah 

Recording: (1266/ 9621) 
is 

Recording: (1267/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1268/ 9621) 
yeah i think they are really helpful and i think that it is the only way that a single mom or anybody raising kids can make it there is really but there is so much fraud and there is so many people that take advantage of it that it hurts the other people that really need it you know like with me i did not wanna stay on it i wanted to be on my own and i was perfectly capable of it but if i did not have the ambition that that i had i might have stayed home there is like nine you know there was even a mother that lived across from me in my apartment complex that i would get up and go to work every day and she would have food delivered to the her front step and she drove that year is car i mean she had a brand new you know like whatever year it was that is the car she had and i i would just shake my head and wonder how she ever got away with it and you know i thought 

Recording: (1269/ 9621) 
yeah oh yeah you know people i was in kindergarten with i graduated with so it is kind of like the small town thing which would have goods and bads but i do not know yeah my parents still live there and i still associate with a lot of friends i graduated with it is still live in town and you know they just had a twenty year reunion here a couple years ago and a lot of participation in that and so 

Recording: (1270/ 9621) 
you can not take that away from me so well you know like you said i think they just go through a lot of stuff i mean i had a lot of uh animositytowards my dad for things that happened you know um perhaps not being there when i was you know younger and stuff like that and uh if anything me and my brother got close because of it you know because he is three years older than me and then uh but but you know now you know i do not have they they are bothnotboth my parentshavepassed away but uh you know i do not have any animositytowards them at all you know i kinda like it is kind of like a growing up thing i i guess you know i mean you you kinda sit there and say yeah you you know you did thebest you could you know i mean 

Recording: (1271/ 9621) 
is often so similar to where i am coming from 

Recording: (1272/ 9621) 
that is a very strong animal and as the old man that got lifted twenty five feet in the air against the pine tree found out in my opinion when that stuff happens when i see when i see someone light the horns of a bull on fire in spain and torment the bull and then all of a sudden the bull gets the flames put out and the bull runs his gourd through the person is leg and throws him around and kicks him right near death i do not have any sympathy for him 

Recording: (1273/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1274/ 9621) 
he would be lost 

Recording: (1275/ 9621) 
we can get to the beach and take them there we have family in florida we have family in hawaii we have family in virginia beach so 

Recording: (1276/ 9621) 
because i went to oregon and of course uh the greater part of the population out there are more socialists than they are capitalists and they are easier to deal with and they are more reasonable people in my OPINION MUCH MORE REASONABLE but then i come back to columbus and all my family and and and all i am the minority in my family <LAUGH> BELIEVE ME <LAUGH> and uh they are very in to capitalism and their lives are working pretty good for them so 

Recording: (1277/ 9621) 
does not that mean make 

Recording: (1278/ 9621) 
and then a couple of years later he was working on a job in the columbus coated fabrics plant which is plant that makes coated fabrics they make uh the main thing is uh auto upholstery car upholstery anyway they had big rolling machines that rolled this stuff out and there is fumes came off of it so they had a big hood and exhaust system 

Recording: (1279/ 9621) 
i do not know i i i do not know if it was drugs or SOME something ridiculous that that a lot of people and i think a lot of the the police force and a lot of other officials are are pretty much in agreement that he should resign and he feels like like he is just not going to and that we do not have any um that the mayor can not nobody can actually make him resign that that is something he has to do on his own and that was one of the big things as far as you know dorothy was teater was saying i am gonna make him do this which is something that she does not have any power to do um that and and about how how they just continue to get raises and they are and they are not doing very much about it and and less than fifty percent of the police force is actually in police cars and and a lot people are are doing desk jobs and those types of things and i i guess a lot of people just are not very happy with the job he is been doing 

Recording: (1280/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1281/ 9621) 
well in in the ambiguous part of it you know just saying try to be protective of the ways 

Recording: (1282/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1283/ 9621) 
because of the gay activism 

Recording: (1284/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1285/ 9621) 
um he moved to texas because like he was moving into like the he was going to s m u there and like so i moved back from florida back to up up here because i did not wanna i did not wanna go with because texas is terrible and like um so then like my mom see like my parents got divorced when i was like five or something and so 

Recording: (1286/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (1287/ 9621)

Recording: (1289/ 9621) 
yeah so it she is funny because she is gained twenty six pounds and yet she does not look pregnant she has on she had on a regular sweater today 

Recording: (1290/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1291/ 9621) 
right now but i knew him when he was eight ten months sober and he worked every day 

Recording: (1292/ 9621) 
i have never heard it said before like you said that that the reason women are not priests is because they do not show any kind of uh spiritual leadership i i have never heard that said and there must be people who think that 

Recording: (1293/ 9621) 
but that is my plan 

Recording: (1294/ 9621) 
that they just do not have those 

Recording: (1295/ 9621) 
you know a historic building they are like oh there is no history in america YKNOW 

Recording: (1296/ 9621) 
um-hum i do not know why that was but it sounds like it i guess and yeah i was called a lot of little things <LAUGH> 

Recording: (1297/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (1298/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (1299/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah like i knew uh like a lot of people who live down on campus i used to live down on hudson like over the summer before i went to o s u um so i mean i like campus and everything it is just like o s u is different than campus yeah 

Recording: (1300/ 9621) 
uh but if you love the if you love someone you want them to do what is right and you want them to learn and if that is the punishment they have to pay for something they did wrong you still love them but you are loving other people also in other words you are not letting the fact this is my child so he can get away with murder but this one over here i am not gonna let get away with it no i am sorry if my child committed something that this other one would have had to pay for i am sorry you have done that dear but and i love you dearly but i try to teach you differently i do not know where you went wrong i do not know what i did wrong whatever but you gotta pay the penalty i mean you have to draw the line somewhere uh but now you said family yes i think the reason and that at our age we look back everyone was born and everyone was loved by a father and by a when they were little and how their formative years are and the education the um the way they were uh taught as they were growing up does help them to become what that president is what that any politician is any minister or anybody else it the way you are raised i firmly believe and the things you were taught does have an impact on what you do the rest of your life and i know a lot of the things that i have done in my life are definitely based on what i saw happen back here you know and i think that it bears on everybody so that is why it really begins with the family 

Recording: (1301/ 9621) 
yeah i mean it is just sort of like the whole reputation of yeah america just being like the country of excess like excess possessions excess food excess weight excess money you know everything you know and it is it is you know i sort of have mixed feelings about it the first time when i was gone for about a year and a half and i came back and you know this i had done like a lot of traveling over there and everything and really loved the whole atmosphere especially of mainland europe and everything and i come back and you know where my parents live there were all these you know new strip malls built and stuff and i just felt like i was in you know this like giant kmart LAND YOU KNOW I MEAN it just was so overwhelming even though obviously i would grown up with in america my whole life and you know not that i sort of changed completely but you do when you have been away from it and to come back and you know to go into these like cavernous places and like just the other day my friend took me to easton and i mean you walk in there and i do not feel like i am in columbus you know i feel like it is got to be california or something just because it is just 

Recording: (1302/ 9621) 
help 

Recording: (1303/ 9621) 
no and she said ya know and and the word the last three or four years she just rode it out so she could retire and she used be very dedicated uh very dedicated teacher she just it was a job then and so i hate see that happen to good teachers 

Recording: (1304/ 9621) 
if you do not make a child support payment they should do the same thing i do not know why they do not have a system like that 

Recording: (1305/ 9621) 
so the state would pay for it 

Recording: (1306/ 9621) 
um when i went i went with my friend 

Recording: (1307/ 9621) 
and she said she would get back to me on it well never heard nothing from her and she is done that to me i do not know how many times

Recording: (1310/ 9621) 
i think they would a bigger problem with it yeah 

Recording: (1311/ 9621) 
oh is that right 

Recording: (1312/ 9621) 
but most of the time like i try and uh like most of the time it is pretty easy like it is pretty straightforward sometimes it is really aggravating when 

Recording: (1313/ 9621) 
uh that is not true i mean uh some of the older men in older tribes and different tribes um 

Recording: (1314/ 9621) 
um i go to north land high school right now 

Recording: (1315/ 9621) 
i do not go to city center too much although i like it being there if i want to go to it

Recording: (1321/ 9621) 
oh yeah and and i i will probably step on your toes here but i i am not a firm believer of mom and dad both working i my wife worked until we had children then she stayed home and once they got into school she worked at a school so when they were gone she was gone when they were home she was home and you know my parents did not do that and i hated it i hated coming home from school by myself every day there was nobody there to talk to you know and i did it for years and and i just feel that you know i i hope you do not have children yet do you good because to me parents who put kids in daycare and uh you know after school programs are like people who have cats and dogs i get up in the morning and i feed my pet my child then i put him in the kennel and i go to work and i go gee i would like to go for some drinks after work or go to a movie we will just put her in another kennel after work and we take her from one kennel to the other kennel we go we will be back a little bit and then i go and i have all my fun and i go pick her up at the kennel and i bring her home and i dust her off 

Recording: (1322/ 9621) 
so be it you know we had the out there helping out the the g i is fine team effort was not it but then after g i is came home the little lady went back in to the house and business all these idle lines say hey we can do something here because in those days the little lady said well i will go out and get a little odd job uh we want a little thing mom would do pick up a little extra things here and so forth dad was a primary breadwinner but she would go out and do some odd jobs just to compliment their needs for that budget they bought things on a cash basis as they needed it they did not go out and spend on credit and now i mean i am jumping ahead of myself here but business said hey let us produce these lines little lady you want a refrigerator we can make it for you and we can make it cheap for you because we can mass produce it 

Recording: (1323/ 9621) 
yeah from what i hear actually the like the emory and the um university of chicago you have to work really hard because they get all the kids who wish they would have got into harvard and then start you know try to make it up by working harder you get to actual harvard nobody works because they are like we already made it you know 

Recording: (1324/ 9621)

yeah well i did not realize that until i had kids 

Recording: (1371/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1372/ 9621) 
i mean i am sure at nineteen i was saying some really bizarre things too uh but you can tell that he is thought about it 

Recording: (1373/ 9621) 
all right number one none of them had a the privileges of having a car where they could drive and go anywhere they wanted when they got out of school and they got a job and they bought the car they had their car they were not allowed to have my car and take it and run over to this kid is house or that kid is 

Recording: (1374/ 9621) 
but when he first started out i liked him he had on sensible things to almost something what we are talking about now i think sometimes but he in order to keep up with the oh uh i can not remember all the names of the shows i do not watch them but i am oprah is one of them and all those other people that is just like her and a of course they get into the smut and everything else and what they have done and all that malarkey and i think he decided he had to do the same thing on his program in order for him to keep his ratings up so you know and see that is what you mean by getting into what this person does over here and that is another thing we need to teach our kids because john doe jane doe is doing it does not mean that is right have the courage to be yourself and say no some people might think you are terrible sometimes but 

Recording: (1375/ 9621) 
and they they say that is a city and my school or where i grew up was more than double that just over double that it was like sixty thousand 

Recording: (1376/ 9621) 
you know and these schools that have a thousand people i just can not imagine i mean you know my my high school was like four hundred people and we thought that was big at the time and just to have a thousand excuse me people and just to try to monitor different things i mean it is gotta be so hard you know in checking everything and 

Recording: (1377/ 9621) 
yeah i live in uh siebert hall oh yeah i got i think there are a hundred and seventy of us here for just from my class alone 

Recording: (1378/ 9621) 
and they used to have the laser light show downtown they do not have it anymore um you know just even if you do one thing free a month 

Recording: (1379/ 9621) 
you know you can do anything for fifty dollars a week you know you could work two two hours a day you know for a week and and fifty dollars for two kids is really not that much a week so 

Recording: (1380/ 9621) 
well i think the people that made that law should uh also too not be able to keep their jobs for more than two years and see how they like it 

Recording: (1381/ 9621) 
and i had to get out uh and other ones it is a it is a struggle with that thing and understanding it takes time to understand it lot of people lot of good people are helping me to try and understand it um i was trying to let the fear of that um though i am not afraid to die i am afraid sometimes that i will die before i get a chance to do what i feel i was sent here to do which is just the basic things fall in love with somebody have children raise them 

Recording: (1382/ 9621) 
uh-huh me too years ago <LAUGH> 

Recording: (1383/ 9621) 
and my but now my daughter is my daughter has twin sons who just are a year out of college and uh i think that they are they one of them particularly is i think in good moral good sort of guy and the other one i do not feel like i know as well but i i really think that they are both good and uh see uh 

Recording: (1384/ 9621) 
well i work i work part time kind of because uh i worked full time when he was uh you know one and i did not uh i felt like um the babysitters or you know whoever saw him more than i did and that because i love my son more then anything in the world and i felt like he needed me you know so i went down to part time i am struggling more but i would rather see my son have me you know 

Recording: (1385/ 9621) 
um-hum i uh <error moved into uh up there one sixty one cleveland area uh but i lived up area for years but i just moved back up there and uh why i left it was because of the the city the traffic and everything where you get around campus you know it is a lot and they sell hustle hustle hustle but down here even with with the kids and everything going to school but basically it is kind of laid back uh where up there it is all go go go uh 

Recording: (1386/ 9621) 
well it is harder than i think in some ways than people think um i went to the teach ohio fair last year to look around and didn did not see that much interest in in uh chemistry or general science teachers um i think the market has is fluctuated back to a point where they do not need as many rightno <LAUGH> they are not clamoring for us <LAUGH> um-hum 

Recording: (1387/ 9621) 
is there really 

Recording: (1388/ 9621) 
i think people are still fairly racist i do not think it is near as bad as it was but at the same time i mean i can not say i blame the white community so much for it i would say it is probably both the white and i guess any other race relation is fault um i mean as far as like if you look at the black communities things like that you have like b e t um you have like the united negro college fund things like that where they are almost segregating themselves by having these organizations because they are geared specifically towards black people and i think in a way that is almost segregating themselves from the rest of the community because they are not giving out equal opportunity to the people that need em um it is sort of like the same thing white people were doing you know thirty forty years ago where that they had they are white organizations or what not um and i think it is sort of going along the same lines where there is still a problem of it but i think it has gotten better at least if nothing else 

Recording: (1389/ 9621) 
where that nice mall is and um some in smyrna which is outside ah atlanta but girls that i met through school and stuff 

Recording: (1390/ 9621)

Recording: (1391/ 9621) 
i mean i am sure there is some but it is not as extreme as some places that i have been 

Recording: (1392/ 9621)

Recording: (1395/ 9621) 
oh i am sure 

Recording: (1396/ 9621) 
it is not that the property taxes are that much higher anyway it is that um the homes are worth more because of the school system 

Recording: (1397/ 9621)

Recording: (1398/ 9621) 
oh it has you know your basic uh lazarus which i like to go to lazarus and sears and j c penny is and uh no i would not want to drive to polaris to go to those stores but if they made some outlets over there you know that i would be happy with that uh there is just a lot of smaller stores you know like victoria secrets and bookstores and toy stores and athletic wear stores um lot those i do not even go to got some kiosks set up outside you know with little the little carts with different little things they sell just like your basic kind of mall

Recording: (1419/ 9621) 
and i have heard the thing you know you are not my real father and all that we went through all that

Recording: (1431/ 9621) 
uhuh enjoy them now you got the terrible twos to go through which is which is cool and uh i remember one time when we got in a big argument one time when she uh when she turned teen teenager and uh i called her up and she was on the phone with somebody else and i sat there and said well you know i am calling long distance she goes so i am talking to my girlfriend i said so what hang up on her and call her back 

Recording: (1432/ 9621)

<LAUGH> 

Recording: (1435/ 9621)

Recording: (1436/ 9621) 
it is like big deal you know common sense it is hot you do not put it in a sensitive area while you are driving to work um but she sued for ten million and the papers said she won ten million she did not i mean after that ten million award was given by a jury then the uh mcdonald is is allowed a an appeal at the end of a year so she does not see any money for a year and that is if they do not appeal but ninety percent of these big corporations have the money behind them they have the lawyers behind them so they can sue for an appeal 

Recording: (1437/ 9621) 
uh it was uh professor uh it was it is it was interesting i mean it is it is it is lot it is lots to remember a lot of terminology but i enjoyed it 

Recording: (1438/ 9621) 
typical dorm room 

Recording: (1439/ 9621) 
um that is probably when they started yeah um-hum 

Recording: (1440/ 9621) 
yeah um yeah i it is hard because i i do come i am a christian so i believe that homosexuality is wrong but i do not like i said i am not gonna condemn them um at all like i said i have friends it i understand what you are saying um but i think that is something more for the parents or the teacher to pick out that maybe that child um is having a problem and then send them to counseling of some sort and not actually incorporate it in a thirty student ensemble um uh it would be nice if we had more of an open environment in schools and if teachers really had the time to notice that maybe somebody had a problem and talk to them about it and then send them on that counseling one on one way um just because if you are gonna teach it to um a large amount of students i am not even sure if that one student would listen because all the rest of them probably be making cracks and just make them feel more do you know what i mean so i do not 

Recording: (1441/ 9621) 
it is pretty cool 

Recording: (1442/ 9621) 
al gore really does not entice me at all he claims he invented the internet <LAUGH> 

Recording: (1443/ 9621) 
um i sort of agree with the fact that if someone wants a gun they will get a gun it does not matter what they do to try to make it so people can not get their hands on guns they are basically always gonna be around and people are always gonna get them if they want them 

Recording: (1444/ 9621) 
humum 

Recording: (1445/ 9621)

Recording: (1447/ 9621) 
uh my stepmother is 

Recording: (1448/ 9621) 
YEAH you know that is that is the thing so i think just being aware and then also like i said with uh with all the i mean and i am uh i am so opinionated in this too and anybody that knows me i look at all the advertising i look at the advertising and i look through and like i see lazarus and i see kohl is and i see sears you look through and you say oh okay you know you are looking for things to buy well then you got a two whole two pages of women in bras and they are looking at the camera they are seductively looking at the camera and you are like okay how many how many different bras do women really need THAT IS not for the women i am sorry you know most women by the time they are buying bras know what choices they have YKNOW THEY do not need all that but then it is funny because then i keep flipping through and i look at the men the men is heads are usually cut off they are not wearing any kind of revealing underwear at all i mean it is just so unequal so we lead these these guys or these poor boys that are growing up we push all this and you know and then expect them to deal with it you know and they see tv shows and and everything else that you know it is okay to be with five women but boy that woman is with more than one man and she is you know i mean i think it is what we teach our kids and that goes back to the government and society and and what we are allowed to to show our kids you know you get involved in the free speech and that is fine but wait till those kids grow up and and wait till those people that were pushing the free speech gets mugged or you know anything else happens to them 

Recording: (1449/ 9621) 
not the actually going through it you know to me it was to her but the aftermath basically you know you

Recording: (1457/ 9621) 
and 

Recording: (1458/ 9621) 
oh i think uh 

Recording: (1459/ 9621) 
i did i did 

Recording: (1460/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (1461/ 9621) 
ok 

Recording: (1462/ 9621) 
so that is you know a lot of my decisions were based upon that 

Recording: (1463/ 9621) 
um but you know i think what they did was fairly good they did not really as far as i remember at that point at least they did not well they must have done gone into the sort of moral issue um but it i what i remember was more of a scientific approach 

Recording: (1464/ 9621) 
for a m c is for um not getting hurt <LAUGH> she works at fedex and um her crew is always getting hurt mainly her 

Recording: (1465/ 9621) 
first year yeah second quarter 

Recording: (1466/ 9621) 
no no but hopefully when they do get the one strike somebody i say somebody because i right now i do not really think we have that in place but we would need more of a um one strike stepping stone you know and let us face it counseling is probably not gonna work uh and somebody in that it would almost take um i do personally know people that go into that type of environment here in columbus and actually work with the families and work with the kids and actually are in there living there showing them you know it is it is one thing to go help them and then leave that and go home to your nice house i do not i admit it i could not do it but um if if people really did things like that i think there would be help for them because they are actually friends or actually people that have been in that environment and come out those type of people i think might be able to reach them i will not be able to reach them probably just because what do i know about it wordword um i am yeah i agree i do not think it would be a deterrent at all initially but if we had more things in place and somebody actually realized the background and tried to get them out of that hopefully even if you save half of them it is better than than anything 

Recording: (1467/ 9621) 
<LAUGH>

it is been a i it is been a remarkably well i mean i have not had any problems i found out pretty early which was kind of strange in about four weeks and i went in and and uh i had a checkup and my doctor he thought i was about seven but they wanted to do an ultrasound well the thing is they did this ultrasound they did not find anything so which was really kinda creepy because they did not know because there is that whole tubule pregnancy thing and all this stuff and and the guy that did my ultrasound was not my regular doctor and he is kind of little he is just a little abrupt for me and he says well you know if this is what it is you know you could have a lot of serious problems you could die and all this stuff and i said wait a minute i am not ready for this but after after we figured out that it was just the time period other than that it is gone really well i mean uh i just i and i know we just finished our lamaze classes last night and there were some women in there they are huge i mean these girls can not even get off the floor and i just feel really BAD FOR THEM SO for me it is it is gone very very well i mean i have not really had any problems 

Recording: (1479/ 9621) 
i think my daughter jennifer is very active uh um not so much um the the type of work that i do but i think she is very charitable very giving very um 

Recording: (1480/ 9621) 
well i do think access is too easy but it is sort of like anything else i think if laws were passed the people who were against it would be so you know just beside themselves that it would i do not know for how long but i think it would make the situation not with the shootings and things like that but i think it would make the just the gun situation probably much worse for a while because people would be you know doing illegal things to get guns and that sort of thing but i mean too many people have guns here there is too much of a in my opinion you know there is too much of a gun culture i mean over there they have pretty much outlawed guns except for hunting and things and the fact that you know of course there are some floating around but the fact that you can pretty much successfully do that obviously england is such a small country in comparison but i mean that is just amazing to me and but it is true i mean the fact that you know the access is just there is almost nothing barred and i mean just the amount of people that i just hear sort of you know in conversation talking about oh yeah i you know getting a gun for security and all this stuff it is like you know what your chances of number one needing it and number two if you were in that just minute percentage of you know happen chance that you would need it the fact that if you used it to shoot someone who was not you know i mean everything is against you 

Recording: (1481/ 9621) 
why i do not know does not make sense 

Recording: (1482/ 9621) 
oh it was on saturday 

Recording: (1483/ 9621) 
well you know my and my girls there are certain products that brand name like uh one of them i know is the meijer uh pudding that you can uh take for lunches which they do and it is like edventure you know adventure but it is edventure well every once in while hunts will be the same price and they will be a coupon in the paper so joyce will or joyce or i we we trade she goes the grocery store once then next two weeks i go and the next two weeks she goes so um she will uh you know she will buy stuff like that with a coupon and she goes and i go why are you buying that and she goes it was cheaper than the meijer brand and then when we eat it it is like it is too sweet you know or it is too overpowering or too sugary and the girls even they the same way they would go we do not like this it is too chocolatey so you know like the manwich stuff it is like they just pour sugar in it i guess because that is what people like and so i find that the unbrand stuff well not unbrand but it is all like a meijer brand or something like that or food club or something like that 

Recording: (1484/ 9621) 
but it is a lot would you say it is a uh say it is a nice place to visit but you would not wanna live there or would you actually live there

Recording: (1486/ 9621) 
i do not know i would like to think i would like to say no sitting here but you never know because i guess that is cause that is what happens to a lot of them you know they they come out of school all idealistic and then they go into industry and then they are molded and assuming they make upper management there is you want the tax breaks you want you know what i mean and then they uh like i have an uncle who is a vice president on wall street for merrill lynch and he said you know he he got out of school he was very idealistic but now he he is he is like all those people they should you know i would i made it through myself and he is not for like the you know but realistically he did not but

Recording: (1494/ 9621) 
and we could do what we wanted <LAUGH> 

Recording: (1495/ 9621) 
when i first you know got a divorce so it is been hard 

Recording: (1496/ 9621) 
that once you filter it through something it looks different but previous to that yeah there is a lot there there is way too much shared experience to to gloss over effectively so when she said look if you never listen to anything else that i say you will listen to this you need to go to europe i was like okay i will go to europe 

Recording: (1497/ 9621) 
to which i had a conversationwithher about it said you know you did not cause anything you know me and your mother caused it all if anything you werethebrightest spot of the whole marriage so and that is where you got to look at yourself when you see that reflection in the mirror remember that you know 

Recording: (1498/ 9621) 
sexuality at all 

Recording: (1499/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (1500/ 9621)

Recording: (1501/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1502/ 9621) 
no where north land is 

Recording: (1503/ 9621) 
oh it will be 

Recording: (1504/ 9621) 
no because um all the kids take that california achievement test i do not know if you are familiar with that and it is like you know because it is say like you and i go to school you go to you go to dublin and i go to the worst school in columbus and we both make straight a is well when you take the california achievement test that really the a is mean nothing because it is like let us see what you understand and have learned the score on that is what really matters to me and both my daughters have really scored exceptionally high on those because you know they always pick on columbus public schools they go oh it is so look how bad their test scores well you know if you take say like uh the worst school in town which i do not know what it what it would be but lets just say it is uh brown school well you have children there who have not seen dad in probably ten years and mom is basically sometimes there or in prison so they live with grandma how do you expect them to do well nobody is there to you know i am not a uh you know like an ogre or anything but you know i always keep tabs on my kids you know like i have always gone to conferences even though they got straight a is i go to conferences and teachers go well what do you come for and i go if i do not come then it is like saying i do not really care so i always go so they know that i am keeping tabs on things and i do not demand a is i just demand them to do their best and i said you know if your best is a c then that is what it will be but i said if your best is an a and you are getting a c you got me to talk to so uh back to the brown school uh there are kids like my daughter there who make straight a is and when they take the um what is that thing the proficiency test zoom through it and get like outstanding on it and uh then you have uh this probably sounds really biased or bigoted but then you have the kid whose mom and dad are not together and and he comes to school maybe twice a week and when he takes proficiency test he gets like a thirty 

Recording: (1505/ 9621) 
like i had my kids last week i had them all write how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and then i had them one by one come up to the table in the front they did not know i was gonna do this so after they get all done i go out and i get my little bag of stuff and i bring in my bread and my peanut butter and my jelly and i sit them down beside me and i go okay now no ad libbing no adding no taking away read exactly what you wrote 

Recording: (1506/ 9621)

Recording: (1509/ 9621) 
they are pretty much all underground things they have a web page up i am not sure what the address is right now 

Recording: (1510/ 9621) 
i my my kids went to a school that well my son had already left it but in the fourth grade they announced took all the kids in the auditorium and said we are closing next year and it was hard but yeah once it is reached the point that is decision is made and announced and i mean there were good reasons for it um and they explained the reasons and ya know at some point you have to figure out how much do you wanna fight something when it is inevitable 

Recording: (1511/ 9621) 
the mustiness the old 

Recording: (1512/ 9621) 
every kid that my kid ran around with i knew his parents one way or the other 

Recording: (1513/ 9621) 
you do not have too many options you know 

Recording: (1514/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1515/ 9621) 
because the larger story was too large to film in one one movie but this one as a as a as a part of a whole i i am reserving complete judgment until 

Recording: (1516/ 9621) 
oh okay 

Recording: (1517/ 9621) 
as uh a lot of mothers do but she was there and if they needed her for anything or needed her to say no to something <LAUGH> she was there and uh yeah i think that uh that probably had something to do with it and the fact that our kids knew what our moral beliefs were 

Recording: (1518/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1519/ 9621) 
yeah she is ALREADY <LAUGH> i did not think she would have it any other way 

Recording: (1520/ 9621) 
yeah meet different people 

Recording: (1521/ 9621) 
oh lassie is one of them yeah along that line 

Recording: (1522/ 9621) 
even if they do not pay me it would still be fun 

Recording: (1523/ 9621) 
like i said you have nothing like that for kids nowadays 

Recording: (1524/ 9621) 
yeah it is like um i do not know they used to have something called exploring posts that were directly related and then um venturing kind of took over for that like in still in boy scouts and then exploring went off on it is own and as a result they took religion out of the program and they put they allow like homosexuality with the leaders and all that so it is i do not know we call it like hippy boy scouts <LAUGH> 

Recording: (1525/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1526/ 9621) 
and we pick out of those because otherwise your kid is gonna hate you 

Recording: (1527/ 9621) 
we had uh counter battery fire we called it which when they were shooting back at us once in north africa was kind of scary uh we were in position where we could fire on a a uh tank battle that was going on we had a forward observer up there where he could look down and see the whole thing and so he was adjusting fire and i do not know how many tanks they claimed that we hit but 

Recording: (1528/ 9621) 
and so it was kind of funny but but the discouraging i mean it was discouraging when you see people that do not have any hope and 

Recording: (1529/ 9621) 
child abuse 

Recording: (1530/ 9621)

you said were their governments government stays out of things that is our problem government is into too many things they need to be out of your nose that is your personal business they need to be out of your business 

Recording: (1539/ 9621) 
i just think it is sad even here in columbus you know like two weeks ago when they had these bomb scares in different high schools and i thought you know i just you know it just could because of all the things you have seen in the world in the last few year that these kids want to do this just to see what is gonna happen 

Recording: (1540/ 9621) 
now what that is industrial nuclearonics or something like that think about now you got the wetlands down there you know where are kids gonna go

Recording: (1544/ 9621) 
that is fine 

Recording: (1545/ 9621) 
they have to get a larger police department to do that that is another thing the cities have grown so much that we do not have adequate protection i do not think anymore and they

yeah that was the most somebody could be um ordered to pay being unemployed 

Recording: (1549/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (1550/ 9621)

Recording: (1551/ 9621) 
they ai not gonna lock me up 

Recording: (1552/ 9621)

Recording: (1555/ 9621) 
you consider the housing trends and there there again that goes back to the stupid consumer i say stupid consumer because when i was in college i always said well consumer had a fourth grade education level

<LAUGH> 

Recording: (1562/ 9621) 
yeah i just like doing it and i have a good set i my my best friend is a realtor uh she is since retired but it is so funny because she would always go through all these statistics and this and that because it the stuff i have done is in and and because i live in area and so she would say oh i do not know and she would say well how much do you have to get it for and how much should and i would say oh i do not know i think if i get it for under a hundred and five i probably can sell it for a hundred and forty if i do this this this and this now you are gonna put a lot of money into that though it is not like you are you are still only gonna make maybe ten thousand dollars profit but um and she would say well i do not know and for a long time she was always real skeptical because i would just like make up these numbers or just have this idea and finally she says oh well rachel i do not know it always works out for you you always get that so just do it and it is just some intuition kind of thing 

Recording: (1563/ 9621) 
like it is like we are taking catalog orders over the phone it is not a really a big deal like they are not seeing how we are dressed at all i mean they tell us we are suppose to wear collared shirts and stuff but nobody does like they do not really enforce it and they too they yell at like and i if like for hugging or whatever like they told us that one day that we could not hug they were like no it is like you can not hug in here or something like that they were like it takes away from the professional attitude it is like i do not even know what to say to people like that like it is just like such a different like 

Recording: (1564/ 9621) 
no they are all boys 

Recording: (1565/ 9621) 
i think that would be perfect 

Recording: (1566/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (1567/ 9621) 
i i used to kinda worry about the effect that tv had on me um i when i was little i used to watch a lot of tv i would come home from school and plop myself in front of the tv and watch i like you know four cartoons back to back or so everyday after school or i that kind of thing and then saturday mornings it would be uh a block of you know from six in the morning until afternoon or something these days i do not watch nearly that much tv um i do not buy these arguments that people make that say that like children are like like violence in tv is affecting children i mean i i have seen some evidence of of exercises where in schools the kids will watch uh like a a violent cartoon like i do not know like roadrunner or something and then be a little rougher but i i do not think that it it goes into like values i do not associate like rising crime or something with uh like crime on tv or something i i mean it if there is a correlation i mean i i am more of the you know like parents have a greater influence on the children then tv ever could i mean i watched a lot tv but i feel that my parents taught me was right and wrong and i watched a lot of rather violent tv violent movies all that kinda thing and uh um 

Recording: (1568/ 9621) 
i remember mcguffey lane i do not know if you know who they are yeah

Recording: (1614/ 9621) 
course my wife is worked in higher education for thirty years so 

Recording: (1615/ 9621) 
brrr she could not accept the fact that you could just disagree with her it had to be because she was black or she was an older woman or you could not just disagree had to be a reason there but fortunately she accused me of that in front of my boss who was black who did not believe it he knew better so 

Recording: (1616/ 9621)

Recording: (1640/ 9621)

oh you have it is like it is like man i well after i heard that i said that is not even worth going if if they are gonna be rude 

Recording: (1653/ 9621) 
well i think at that age the parents should be involved and hopefully they will be open minded enough to know that this is going to be something she is going to have the rest of her life um i will tell you what with today is world and some of these fourteen year olds that look like they are twenty and you know they they know what they are doing and no they should not keep repeating that um i just think the most important thing is is for them to be able to have the option i really do but yes the parents should be involved i would say to the age seventeen maybe you know i think they should have a parent is consent and hopefully the parents will love their daughter enough to realize what a mistake it is going to be if she is gonna be young mother and then eventually maybe not even want to be a mother you know i mean there is a lot of girls that have those babies and then they just they kill them you know and there is so much that for a while there that was going on and it is like you i can not believe these women are doing this you know they just snap <LAUGH> 

Recording: (1654/ 9621)

Recording: (1655/ 9621)

um-hum 

Recording: (1682/ 9621) 
that is funny 

Recording: (1683/ 9621) 
yeah i mean i i think that the stories have not been ah i i mean i am some of my favorite like lines from the simpsons is where there highly critical one of my favorites is uh when bart the one with where bart thinks he loses his soul which in some ways is kinda preachy um cause i mean like lisa takes other positions like ya whether the soul is is real it does not matter da da da da da but i love it one scene while they are cleaning out the uh well bart and milhouse are being punished they are cleaning out the pipes of the organs and the the pipes of the organ and uh like bart is like there is no such thing as a soul milhouse is like why would they lie to us what would they have to gain and then they it cuts to uh reverend lovejoy emptying the uh uh uh what are they uh the the tip jars the the donation thing into a little change counting machine like i do not hear cleaning <LAUGH> what would they have to gain <LAUGH> um 

Recording: (1684/ 9621)

Recording: (1691/ 9621) 
my family and i will see them face to face and i will recognize them and they will recognize me but something transcends them because as i look to them unlike when they are on earth my goodness we are taught to learn the most negative thing about person psychology says if you see a blank sheet of paper you see the dot on the thing you do not see the other ninety nine percent of the paper you see that dot it is gonna be just the opposite in heaven i can not think of a negative thing about you and the reason why you can not think of a negative thing about them because you see christ is appearance coming through them

and they were in italy and europe and uh there was not the definite enemy in vietnam that there was in europe i think that is part of it and of course the attitude of most of the guys that went to vietnam was a little bit different from from where i was probably is a consequence of our understanding of the the uh 

Recording: (1981/ 9621) 
or maybe it is crime that is going down in the sense that it is supplying you know it is criminals are not as active but there is more and more of these acts of violence maybe it is because they are so dramatic that you notice it

Recording: (1991/ 9621) 
but it and it is it is parents that fight for the society and the what is in your community you know the parents for each individual child they have to all form together as a group and almost be all parents to all these kids as a group you know it is not you can be the best parent in the world at home and then your kid goes to school and it accesses the computer or they get in a group of kids where their parents they do not even know where they are you know it is the kids responsibility to get and go to school you know maybe the mom and dad did not even come home the night before but you know i mean there is all different kinds of situations so i think it does start with parents because they need to be aware of what all the kids are being um shown and and have access to

Recording: (1998/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1999/ 9621)

Recording: (2004/ 9621) 
um i think i think that there should be a mandatory because you have it in big companies you have mandatory um sexual harassment tapes and and you learn you teach the girls that it is not what they do it is how they make you feel is is constituted as your uh yeah harassment there and they are too afraid and then besides that they you know there is crushes on you know you can not fault the girls for having crushes and things like that they are going through enough things as it is

Recording: (2006/ 9621) 
aw that is nice 

Recording: (2007/ 9621) 
oh yeah yeah 

Recording: (2008/ 9621) 
yes it is definitely having an effect on uh children and uh uh the schools are trying to catch up or make up for it but they are not doing it yet whether they will be able to pick up enough uh by changing the way they teach and so on in the next twenty years i do not know but uh i am glad my children went to school when they did <LAUGH> AND I stayed home with them 

Recording: (2009/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (2010/ 9621)

Recording: (2011/ 9621) 
check this out and then he will let go and fall on his butt <LAUGH> it is kind of funny 

Recording: (2012/ 9621) 
yeah there is like people call in and talk about other like they saw it in this other mail order catalog that i have never heard of either it is i do not know how really they do it like it is just like they get people is names and stuff from credit card companies and then mail them out things and people call back or whatever 

Recording: (2013/ 9621) 
somewhat 

Recording: (2014/ 9621) 
like you know 

Recording: (2015/ 9621) 
YOU DIDNT SCREW IT on right and 

Recording: (2016/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (2017/ 9621) 
what his background really was 

Recording: (2018/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah i graduated from athens high school uh enroled in uh o u for uh the winter quarter and proceeded to party that out and and at the time 

Recording: (2019/ 9621) 
yeah it was very hard for me to stay in school i could have easily quit like that because the teachers did not i went to a columbus public school and it they did not care i mean i i went through elementary and middle school with straight a is and b is then got there and i was on c is to d is you know and it just was really the teachers did not care you know if you learned you learned if you do not you do not if you do not come to school you do not they do not care that was how my school was so i do not there i do not there was nothing there that really i can remember that <LAUGH> did anything good for me i mean i think middle school taught me a lot more than high school 

Recording: (2020/ 9621) 
they are not as many of them or you mean because 

Recording: (2021/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (2022/ 9621) 
and she is taken very good care of herself she followed all the doctor is uh orders and she is very careful what she eats and 

Recording: (2023/ 9621) 
um-hum hum hum 

Recording: (2024/ 9621) 
uh i live up north um around carl and uh morse road 

Recording: (2025/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2026/ 9621) 
but it is not gonna work i mean they if you are around people i mean number one they are around their parents and their siblings and that is socialization you go to church or to the library or wherever i mean you are around people and you are around children and they get to have socialization if you want to call it whatever and i think from everything that i have read and seen that um they get the socialization that they need at home and they are not relying so much on their peers and their peer is opinions because i i for one example the pokemon craze my son did not know what pokemon was until he heard some other kids talking about it and you know it is just like stuff like that it is just like they do not they do not know what half of that stuff is unless some other kid is pushing it in their face you know and then even still they are just like oh it is cool because everybody else likes it they do not really know what it is or what it is about or i mean <LAUGH> you know what i mean because it is like now they just blow up each other or whatever it is like really what is the point to the whole thing and he did not know what it was until he heard some other kids talking about it oh it must be cool because some other kids are talking about it but then he decided that it was not cool so that was my our influence on him rather than the peer is influence on him 

Recording: (2027/ 9621) 
it is grace brethren christian middle school it is part of worthington schools cause they annexed it 

Recording: (2028/ 9621) 
um i get a b s which they mail to me after first year of medical school like they figure that uh gross anatomy and all that is enough 

Recording: (2029/ 9621) 
yeah that seems good 

Recording: (2030/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah 

Recording: (2031/ 9621) 
um i do not know you know 

Recording: (2032/ 9621) 
he seemed confused parenting with controling 

Recording: (2033/ 9621) 
so i am not gonna get too much of an attitude from people 

Recording: (2034/ 9621) 
i think it is important to know what the person is values an customs are and to support whatever it is an if i mean we have done some wild things over there but i mean it is i mean we have changed rooms around beds around positions of how beds needed to be placed in order that they needed uh face the north star or uh they needed to have this thing above the bed or under the bed and i mean if it is important for them to have prayer then i think it is important to get the appropriate people over and encourage them to have whatever it is they need 

Recording: (2035/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (2036/ 9621) 
and i do not really think it is something that needs to be taught um the only thing probably is like what do they call that uh cultural diversity or whatever classes they have us take i think that i do not think is such a bad idea uh because just because you grew up in i do not know what i grew up in but i will i will give an example i did not grow up in let us say somebody goes hunting and fishing and drives trucks and wears ball caps and listens to country music does not mean if somebody does not do that they are not okay i think that would be a good idea or you know cultures all are different so if you wanted to view that as a culture or do you know what i mean that that is something different um accept the people you do not have to like what they are doing but they are still people so 

Recording: (2037/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2038/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (2039/ 9621)

Recording: (2059/ 9621) 
i that is certainly possible there are lots of ways that my brain does not WORK IN WAYS THAT OTHER people is do so i think i think a lot of it too has to to do with being comfortable with yourself and knowing you know i mean i have gotten so much better over the years i was very i have always been real lot more temperamental we always joke you know that that predictable and some of those things are not um even tempered are not things you would use to describe me but but not in a negative negative way you know i just think that as i have gotten older too i have been able to see things and not be so get so concerned about things that that really were not that important anymore

Recording: (2182/ 9621) 
yeah well there was not even an opportunity for me to try and think of ways to say it it just there was nothing there there was no ability to communicate there was a he needs to know this piece of information at the same time there is no way i could tell it to him so yeah <LAUGH> is like so so i am yeah you do not know and there is nothing else to do about it and continue on merrily and he is i he said eventually he said it was some time later when i actually found out WHAT WAS going on i said i had some suspicions because you can do a quick party count and figure out who is not there and assume something bad has happened but um but he said but it was a while before i found out actually so so we can stop we can stop the story here or we can go on because this story it it is a fun story but

think about things i mean it is pretty easy to do 

Recording: (2452/ 9621) 
well i agree that we should help them maybe through some sort of government program but i think what really hurts them the most is the people that actually give them the money on high street because it really does not motivate them to get out of the gutter i mean if they can make a living off of begging change off of college students they are probably gonna stay with that because it is real easy life 

Recording: (2453/ 9621)

think the point is they are on drugs you know and i do not yeah i am not i do not consider myself racist at all it is UNFORTUNATE that that is what is happening but it is just one of those things that you hate to say yeah i am for it because you sound like it is like everything is specific and permanent yeah i kind of have a problem with that um because they might change their mind but then again they can always adopt you know and i kind of look at it that way there is enough kids out there that need love and 

Recording: (2455/ 9621) 
gosh you know that is one of the things that i have really you know when i read the paper i think wow what can you do it has to start there first you know and i think if um and i <LAUGH> and this might be because i am a woman but i think if women started running things it would be a lot different than when men run things because men tend to think you know like the government and that kind of thing those kind of um funds that are available for different organizations and they are all geared toward things that essentially help them as a whole or help um well yeah but i mean not so much that um it is always been the women is responsibility to be responsible for the kids or to care about their well being and the a peaceful environment and all that kind of thing men are more let us go get it and you know we need more money and you know they are 

Recording: (2456/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (2457/ 9621) 
i am sure i am sure it is you know it is just the circles i move in 

Recording: (2458/ 9621) 
um-hum uh yeah you slept you know it would well you can see it here i mean you can uh see some nineteen year old or eighteen year old uh guy or girl or whatever you know and see the difference in the maturity you know of uh another couple three different people and everything uh i do not know whether me coming from like a rural area you know athens and everything uh and i think it maybe has something to do with that even true today you know you are more uh family oriented um um your you are friends are basically you know you count them on your hands which you still can but uh but you socialize a lot more if you are in the city with more people and everything where if you come from like a smaller town you tend to socialize with a certain people you know group or or whatever you know 

Recording: (2459/ 9621) 
uh i got thrown out of high school 

Recording: (2460/ 9621) 
i mean he is uh he is kind of in big trouble they they are wanting to pull the charter on him and everything so that but he is gonna try and um keep the school open which is gonna be ridiculous 

Recording: (2461/ 9621)

beggars i love it 

Recording: (2464/ 9621) 
it ai not my job i am doing her work she ai not 

Recording: (2465/ 9621) 
i do not agree with that at all i think if your parents are unhappy together only thing that is gonna happen is it is gonna trickle down and you are gonna have to listen to them being miserable and and i think it is much more positive to have two families that are happy than one family that is miserable and they fight and then you feel like it is your you know people say it is a my fault because this happened you know and i think for me it was easier that they split up when i was younger then i i can not imagine being a teenager and having my parents split up i think that that would be probably very difficult um so i do not that is a totally different perspective just to look at it from from that point of view just because i was a lot younger 

Recording: (2466/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (2467/ 9621) 
like while she was studying or something i think we played this homer simpson stuff SHE GOT she got so mad it was so worth it <LAUGH> 

Recording: (2468/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2469/ 9621) 
it it might uh it might um i was gonna say earlier and i and i forgot to mention it is that one of the best campaigns i have seen in recent years utilizing college age students has been clinton is campaign both times uh he knew he needed to get a base to increase um his chances of winning the election and did especially in the first campaign in and and i believe that was ninety two did a really super job of organizing college students because that is when you are at your most um well when you believe in things and you are at your most idealistic and you would think that you know kids would automatically be interested in something and he was able to tap into that um in addition to that and as an under current it was not overt in the clinton campaign but i know when i talked to people uh and you have to be careful where you do this because abortion is an a very divisive issue in this country and i think it it does mobilize people but it also divides them you know definitively almost like in vietnam almost like that war divided people um but i would tell many many women that they had to vote for clinton because it was the difference between protecting roe versus wade and not and in protecting choice you know i um and i i am starting to see that now even in in the gore campaign there i have seen a couple of editorials in the paper about you know the next president will again have an opportunity to appoint two to three supreme court justices and at that if you want to protect that right you have gotta vote with the candidate who is gonna put the best justices on the supreme court and i got a lot of people to vote for clinton that way both in ninety two and again in four years in ninety six uh and i think that is gonna happen again uh because the the candidates and i am telling you my politics here VERY CLEARLY and early but the candidates have pretty well spoken on that issue already i know which one will protect the right for choice uh and um uh i think we need to protect that so yes i think it will but i do not think it is an issue that if you did overtly and said you know support candidate a over candidate b because they will protect abortion rights that is gonna divide the country and not keep us together 

Recording: (2470/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2471/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (2472/ 9621)

Recording: (2473/ 9621)

Recording: (2487/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2488/ 9621) 
you

Recording: (2491/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah she went to school here till uh ninety one actually uh so she was let us see about the fourth grade fifth grade something like that 

Recording: (2492/ 9621) 
to say you know what i am sick of this i am gonna shoot those people but i 

Recording: (2493/ 9621) 
as far as what he did i i am sure that he probably did go to meetings but uh as far as being a leader or something like that he i know i do not i am sure he was not 

Recording: (2494/ 9621) 
and um i think they have a lot to do you know the parks and things like that so um i will just hold it but i like it because it has art and culture and um it does not feel like a big city 

Recording: (2495/ 9621) 
most of them are still sadly just sitting there and following my directions but they are getting better 

Recording: (2496/ 9621) 
i do not think you would do that here <LAUGH> 

Recording: (2497/ 9621) 
wow 

Recording: (2498/ 9621) 
really you know i agree i mean none of the above you go and i think a lot more people would certainly go out they would vote for none of the above and they we can have some more candidates 

Recording: (2499/ 9621) 
yeah i know its good one of us FEELS THAT WAY <LAUGH> 

Recording: (2500/ 9621) 
and 

Recording: (2501/ 9621) 
that was grade school 

Recording: (2502/ 9621) 
i mean some really wacky 

Recording: (2503/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2504/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2505/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2506/ 9621) 
obviously it is not something new that is been coming AROUND i mean it is obviously been around for a long time 

Recording: (2507/ 9621) 
they go 

Recording: (2508/ 9621) 
yeah well what um what my opinion on our whole penal system is just you know well it goes along with not kind of neglecting the kids in our schools now and we are definitely neglecting criminals they need to have be educated and and worked with i mean they need to obviously they some place some point they have uh learned incorrect reasoning or whatever you call it and and they need to uh they need to have psychological help period 

Recording: (2509/ 9621) 
but it did not bother me uh religion is basically everybody when i was in there back in the sixties the i mean everybody was pretty much a christian you know christianity either catholic or something like that but uh nowadays you know you have the uh uh more outspoken muslims and uh islam and uh and judaism and everything so and there again i do not have a problem with that you know because you you got to meet yourself you know you got to make your peace with your maker because you know if you believe in religion you are you are here temporarily for an eternity later on you know 

Recording: (2510/ 9621) 
he was being real helpful you know with the uh being a support you know my parents are very supportive but you know it was just sickening that i when i sat down there and they just you know the bidding started at a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars and actually they offered us twelve thousand dollars my attorney looked at him and said are you fucking nuts he said this guy had his head split open and it was your negligence so you know we will we will take that as an insult 

Recording: (2511/ 9621) 
to with our neighbors like years ago you knew everybody in in town well the town I GREW up in was summit station and i do not know if you know that old teeny weeny town or not but it is NOT a very big town and everybody knew everybody 

Recording: (2512/ 9621) 
i wish i knew the answer uh but the reality you know uh i just feel sorry for the the people that not only feel that they have to do that but and also for the people that are involved in it on the other those victims and everything and their parents and everything the only one i really had a i was really upset with uh was the columbine deal and that was because uh the one kid was making bombs and stuff like that in the basement and the parents knew nothing about or or they did they did not even think anything about and i do not think that behavior it is uh appropriate for a sixteen seventeen year old kid um 

Recording: (2513/ 9621) 
um because he he likes he went through this hitting spell where he liked to hit people and i smack his hands for that and i try not to yell but it is HARD not to yell i try to talk to him 

Recording: (2514/ 9621) 
oh yeah we are members of there 

Recording: (2515/ 9621) 
yeah um 

Recording: (2516/ 9621) 
uh and he had been through a counseling experience before and it and it he just played along with it then to get out of it i think that 

Recording: (2517/ 9621) 
sure 

Recording: (2518/ 9621) 
nothing serious no 

Recording: (2519/ 9621) 
so i mean basically the entire winter i would either be doing stuff by myself or on the team wrestling with my friends so the whole reason i quit wrestling is because the coach wanted me to cut too much weight i was really starting to feel it physically 

Recording: (2520/ 9621) 
okay so our backbone still there but ultimately as we get traffic uh measurements we will be able to downsize the number of pipes we have so streamlining our network 

Recording: (2521/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2522/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2523/ 9621)

Recording: (2528/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2529/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2530/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (2531/ 9621) 
i that is another thing that that we are i am at odds with with my parents were that they do not understand the fact that why would i go to college i paid for it myself i worked my way through school i was so proud the fact that i was like only a quarter late than my actual schedule to graduate which is pretty amazing given the fact that i was paying for it as i went and and i did not have any loans i was when i was done it was paid for and so um course tuition was a hundred twenty five dollars a quarter but i was only making you know fifty cents an hour at the beverly across the street on neil avenue so um uh but but anyhow you know they could never understand you know well you you never got a job with it you know why would you go to school and waste all that money i it was the best money i ever spent 

Recording: (2532/ 9621) 
you know they are just trying to spread out a little bit and eventually it will be something a little more nationwide but they really just wanted to start off with something easy and um they only take national merit scholars in there 

Recording: (2533/ 9621) 
turn the turn the music up and it is already blasting you know uh 

Recording: (2534/ 9621)

Recording: (2544/ 9621) 
but they lived in a beautiful home i mean if you are to i mean kids like that i could see if they are in a poor in harlem or whatever but these kids lived in a nice neighborhood in a beautiful home in colorado i mean you know i just think they were removed from what their children or their son was doing 

Recording: (2545/ 9621)

i do not say that of all of the kids because i know that some of them were brought up right 

Recording: (2549/ 9621) 
you know my older sister was a different case she was a little badder but it it is you know as long as you have a good parent to you know i think that is really all that matters because my mom was my mother and father she she did very well 

Recording: (2550/ 9621) 
it is medicare type thing 

Recording: (2551/ 9621)

Recording: (2563/ 9621) 
and you told me not to this that trying stick to that sorry um 

Recording: (2564/ 9621) 
yeah and and the problem is uh the problem is seeing things in other people i mean actually seeing spirits in other people in terms of someone said the eyes are the mirror to the soul that is very true you know i could see in certain people is eyes when i was in the hospital the confusion the unsure feelings you know the uh i do not know i did not there is something that i could see there that i can not explain and i still can not explain it i just know what i see and then i go and try and tell the psychologist psychiatrist well they want to put me on some kind of anti hallucinogenic medication and i said well listen man you know i am not hallucinating

Recording: (2569/ 9621)

Recording: (2570/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2571/ 9621) 
not really you just kind of lay on the floor and watch everybody else go around 

Recording: (2572/ 9621) 
you know you have to be a good example i mean if you if you are just that for your kids then that is all they need you know you might not always do the right things or say the right things but if you are taking care of yourself and you stay positive and do the rightthings then think that is the best you can do for them 

Recording: (2573/ 9621) 
so he gives him a drug called wellbutrin which is a you know like an antidepressant type thing that they said works for uh a d h d but it really helped him you know concentrate to be able to study

well i think they need to do away with a lot of the foster homes uh uh you know a lot of the you know there is people with good intentions but i just think that it just needs to be restructured totally different way and uh you know maybe pull these kids uh into more of a group setting or something and give them more um you know counseling uh professional you know counseling because it is um you know i i did not have good experiences with foster homes and and i know of a lot of kids you know they are saying that i think the parents have too many rights you know in the courts and there is just a lot going on you know that uh it is not gonna get better it is gonna get worse you know with the way families are torn apart now and uh you know mothers have to work and uh you just can not you know stay home and be that uh you know perfect mom you know so there is just a lot going on uh that needs to be restructured so 

Recording: (2578/ 9621) 
these 

Recording: (2579/ 9621) 
i mean obviously if SOMEONES like thirty and they are gay i do not see them as being too wanting to change their entire life basically at that point in time 

Recording: (2580/ 9621) 
if you were not here well he was the first capital punishment case in ohio in ah twenty or twentyfive years or something like that and he killed somebody and he was on death row and he wanted to be executed and i thought that is a copout if there ever was one just to give him a lethal injection and let him go he should have rotted in prison for <LAUGH> no that is not a punishment he was off his rocker there is not anybody who murders who is not insane 

Recording: (2581/ 9621) 
and they had they you know they went through their own training and everything we did not interface with each other or nothing like that you know i mean you might see one walking or marching somewhere but as far as fraternizing you were not allowed to 

Recording: (2582/ 9621) 
it is so corrupt they have two choices to stay in it and try or to succumb to all the things and ninety percent of them as you can see what happens in washington have succumbed you know there is a i do not i do not hear any of them raising hell about what really matters in this country 

Recording: (2583/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (2584/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2585/ 9621) 
um i do not really know honestly i mean it is definitely careless nature and definitely something has to be done to em 

Recording: (2586/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2587/ 9621) 
it is a little hard to accept um you know i it is it is hard to know what he is going through how much of it is um normal teenage rebellion and how much of it is just 

Recording: (2588/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2589/ 9621) 
well yeah when he was i do not remember how many months it went on for like two months where he just cried it might have been colic or whatever but he cried and yep 

Recording: (2590/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (2591/ 9621) 
and because of that the um um athletic director that was here at the time he quit because he did not want to fire them and they overruled him 

Recording: (2592/ 9621)

Recording: (2595/ 9621) 
it is like a double scene like it is weird 

Recording: (2596/ 9621) 
and then remember back on it 

Recording: (2597/ 9621) 
like ever but i do not know it was real weird i 

Recording: (2598/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2599/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2600/ 9621) 
well i i think that my opinion is that if you ai not going to school and you are not going you are not working and everything you should uh be doing something besides causing problems you know and a lot of kids that is all they really wanna do nowadays is just cause aggravation to people 

Recording: (2601/ 9621) 
to the hub um which course eliminated down time but with um that we were not in a position to monitor traffic 

Recording: (2602/ 9621) 
oh well 

Recording: (2603/ 9621) 
and i think um of course we would all hope that abortion would not be that that nobody would have an abortion that would be the perfect world because nobody would ever be in a situation where they would need one um but i also think uh you know i i mean yeah there should not be there should not should not spend six weeks on abortion OR six weeks on what to do if you are pregnant um but but i think the subject has to be mentioned just just in passing in health class maybe and then and then there ought to it ought to be it it should be known that you can go to your counselor 

Recording: (2604/ 9621) 
and i sit there and go you know i tell people the v a clinic and everything and they got a homeless thing uh over there i say you know this guy friend i know you know he is a vietnam vet you guys need to get out there and help him you know i mean you are in more of a uh situation than i am to be able to go out and and and sit there and but he wants me to take him like mary haven or something like that and he is been there before and all he does is stay till he sobers up and goes back out 

Recording: (2605/ 9621) 
of the medical school class which is two hundred twenty 

Recording: (2606/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (2607/ 9621) 
ninja TURTLES well the kids went into that just so and they were supposed to be real good guys but i mean what uh the visual was pretty miserable in my opinion they wore these masks and hoods and 

Recording: (2608/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2609/ 9621) 
kinda you know we know but it is 

Recording: (2610/ 9621) 
that would be great <LAUGH> i would do it definitely 

Recording: (2611/ 9621) 
if you got a car it is easy to get there yeah but if you if you are ride the bus it is sometimes uh takes a couple hours so 

Recording: (2612/ 9621) 
in some ways i like it in some ways it is not my favorite place but it seems like it is relatively safe place to live although that is coming from me i have been robbed at gun point or knife point about four times i think in columbus yeah maybe five um i drove a taxi cab for couple summers and i was robbed think twice driving the cab and part of it was just being stupid but it was down around mount vernon area and uh they got very little money but i was not hurt <LAUGH> 

Recording: (2613/ 9621) 
on tv and in the movies 

Recording: (2614/ 9621) 
i love columbus actually um when i left i was fed up with columbus and but like anything you know after being away for a while and not really you know being i mean i have friends there and everything but you know i missed my friends and i missed really sort of you know knowing everything in the city because london is never gonna be like that for me you know and it is just a totally different experience and you know i did miss columbus and i am kinda glad to be back although now i miss london SO <LAUGH> 

Recording: (2615/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2616/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2617/ 9621) 
they tried sampling well my brother rich was one of the families they sampled 

Recording: (2618/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2619/ 9621) 
YEAH 

Recording: (2620/ 9621) 
instead they pick up on oh so and so was arrested for drug dealing today he you know so and so age and they sort of give background on him and that is what everyone bases their view on it seems to be is that everyone turns to the media to see what is going on when the media is only showing one side of the story i mean there is definitely much more out there that is going on than they are telling you um so i really do not see a big problem with the way the america is going or whatever the youth um and like say i would not say it is any WORSE than any past generations i mean other than like i mean obviously like guns and things like that are being around but simply the reason being was because in past generations they were not around for it 

Recording: (2621/ 9621) 
yeah we did not really get the the video tape they gave us was half infomercials and then <LAUGH> THINGS LIKE things like how to clean the umbilical i mean stuff like that but you are as far as actual parenting things on it there was really nothing 

Recording: (2622/ 9621) 
yeah actually his his dad is mother babysits 

Recording: (2623/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2624/ 9621) 
but the professors seem more centered to me they are like you have to balance it which i am sure is the truth you know you can not diminish all your bottom line for you know making your workers feel good but there is still something to it i think 

Recording: (2625/ 9621) 
again it gets back to the ten percent tithing and um i think there is something else in the bible where you know she the lady gives gives only a small portion compared to a larger portion but in relation to what her income was that meant a lot more and that we need to get more involved in that we need promote more of that if we are going package things materialize we need to think more of that but i think really take hold of the night what would you be doing if you are a third world country did not have choice 

Recording: (2626/ 9621) 
i said this will never work i am not interested take it back and he said no no no just let us just work with us just work with us we will we will take care of this so i ended up selling to him for hundred and forty four but it was just funny because i thought he i thought they are never gonna get to where i have to be and we are not even gonna play this game back and forth 

Recording: (2627/ 9621) 
i thought it was stupid 

Recording: (2628/ 9621) 
um i mean obviously it is something that happens everyday and things likethat um <LAUGH> like said by no means am i saying yay go president clinton or anything likethat but um i mean i can not say i would hold it against him for doing something like that i mean it isnothing that threatened the nation or whatever 

Recording: (2629/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> oh 

Recording: (2630/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2631/ 9621) 
uh i think that 

Recording: (2632/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2633/ 9621) 
um-hum um-hum yeah i guess my i guess what i would say mostly for that is that the parents are too busy with their own careers and they do not take time to raise their kids and establish the morals in the home and they are just like oh well they will learn it there whatever and the kids um they are basic where they learn things is their peers they do not get it everything instilled at home that is pretty much what you know i have seen talking to my husband and you know and there is so many broken homes and single moms and trying to trying to do it all and the kids are the ones that are suffering and having to grow up before they are ready 

Recording: (2634/ 9621) 
i think there might be but i think most of them are a dying breed they are the older citizens um many in my generation uh they would just probably be because i am i am the early baby boom i am i am the first of the baby boom uh and that is when the woman is movement started and many men there still have not always accepted that so there there might be a problem there but for the the the the generations even the later baby boom generations behind me when i talk to them i talk to uh high school students or even young college students um there there is a a whole world of difference between their attitudes in a lot of things and you know women is minority issues uh they just second hand to them it it does not you know it is not like it was for us which was a sea change for them it is normal so and more of those people are in the voting population if they would vote <LAUGH> you know you would have to find a candidate who would know how to do what clinton did in ninety two and get out that college vote 

Recording: (2635/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2636/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2637/ 9621)

Recording: (2639/ 9621)

Recording: (2640/ 9621) 
oh my gosh they do not have any of these like student matinee specials where you can go in for like a buck fifty huh <LAUGH>

Recording: (2668/ 9621)

yeah 

Recording: (2683/ 9621) 
uh it was for me and a couple other people and that was it 

Recording: (2684/ 9621) 
but 

Recording: (2685/ 9621) 
well i among the people i know i i you know we are i i think it is a pretty tolerant city um uh i know a lot of people who live down in old town you know in a very ah diverse environment and um um you know i just i just do not i do not personally know any racists i do not think 

Recording: (2686/ 9621)

Recording: (2687/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2688/ 9621) 
yeah more yeah or more you know i do not i do not even know because to start it is just such a huge problem and it is gotten so out of hand it is gonna be everybody all together that has to work it is gonna be the teachers and the government and everybody but they all have to have one common thing and it cracks me up because we are so concerned about elian this this poor little kid everybody knows who he is but you know you look at our own kids we do not even care about our own kids as much as we care i mean here is this little kid who still has a living parent and and i do not understand that at all i mean that is just so i think the government gets involved in totally you know way out of line and 

Recording: (2689/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2690/ 9621) 
um i like this stuff as opposed to like sitting around and playing computer games first of all because it is more interesting it is a lot more practical you know it is little more problem solving less running around and shooting things you know um it is like problem solving type you know little puzzles it is not as much sit in front of a tv and be entertained it is you create your own entertainment no 

Recording: (2691/ 9621) 
well hide in your basement i guess and i but i mean what you can 

Recording: (2692/ 9621) 
no i do not see that kind of racism at all 

Recording: (2693/ 9621) 
it is it is interesting too because when she had her other child uh her she had made arrange she was at uh otterbein then she made arrangements that uh she might have to be in the hospital taking a final with one of her teachers so that baby was born in march so i think she got the finals right in or you know it is just too much stress for me to even think about <LAUGH> <LAUGH> 

Recording: (2694/ 9621) 
even though i knew better at the point when i was faced with that at seventeen or whatever i wanted to be so bad that it was something that i you know what i mean and i knew better but you just you know and it is like well i was not that strong granted but i was probably the normal teen and i think most of the people i knew at that age were lost it much younger than seventeen you know ok <LAUGH> eleven twelve it is like ew he we even look alike <LAUGH> forget it but um yeah so i think i think birth control would be good and 

Recording: (2695/ 9621) 
end of march i do not have a plane ticket yet i have a eurail pass though 

Recording: (2696/ 9621) 
um-hum he was he did some assistant coach work at uh o s u for o s u he really liked that <LAUGH> 

Recording: (2697/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2698/ 9621) 
because apparently they apparently they get really fascinated by the fact that the lights are moving around right in front of them so i do that for i do it right in front of their face and they would be like dude that 

Recording: (2699/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2700/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2701/ 9621) 
well i was married but i did not have any kids once have kids not gonna be able to do that kind of a schedule but um yeah so i did not take off any time and then when i got my masters i ran into an old friend of mine who teaches in worthington and he said oh i am the special ed director up there now we need a resource room teacher why do not you come up and interview for this position or that position or when i went up and interviewed for that position got another position but anyway it all worked OUT 

Recording: (2702/ 9621) 
yeah yeah to sit on it she is not allowed on the couch but we had caught her last winter on the couch you know you come home and it is warm and hey there is a doggy bone up here hmmm 

Recording: (2703/ 9621) 
even they do not get facts right a lot of time uh 

Recording: (2704/ 9621) 
and i could not be part of a veterinary practice that uh did that 

Recording: (2705/ 9621) 
um there were one or two 

Recording: (2706/ 9621) 
oh sure yeah 

Recording: (2707/ 9621) 
YKNOW <LAUGH> 

Recording: (2708/ 9621) 
but that is what i 

Recording: (2709/ 9621) 
so it is really weird because uh 

Recording: (2710/ 9621) 
um-hum right right and and it seems to me kind of a questionable thing to tell a teacher i am supposed to get an a what is wrong with you <LAUGH> what is wrong with you 

Recording: (2711/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2712/ 9621) 
huh 

Recording: (2713/ 9621) 
of course that never happened 

Recording: (2714/ 9621) 
so it worked out well 

Recording: (2715/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2716/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2717/ 9621) 
and as more and more people are getting older and older there be more need for it <LAUGH> it be a lot of things there is gonna be more need for as people get older 

Recording: (2718/ 9621) 
um-hum no i feel funny that i am i mean i wish i was married if i was married it would be so much simpler in life but you know it just just did not work out you know i was with his father for like nine years since i was sixteen and he just did not grow up once we had him he did not change like i changed and so 

Recording: (2719/ 9621) 
i do not want either of these people

so 

Recording: (2721/ 9621) 
yeah he is a real nice guy 

Recording: (2722/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> yeah you should be we are all aware because the school has a big impact on the children and sometimes not all that positive right now so you know but you can tell how your child is doing of course 

Recording: (2723/ 9621) 
um seventeen and nineteen 

Recording: (2724/ 9621)

<LAUGH> 

Recording: (2730/ 9621) 
yes um-hum 

Recording: (2731/ 9621) 
but at the same time i mean i do not <LAUGH> dislike them or anything for it i mean it is it is their choice i mean fact of the matter is it does not have any effect or anything on my life so 

Recording: (2732/ 9621) 
i picked up one kid he he had been in uh he was only about fifteen he was adopted and he ran away 

Recording: (2733/ 9621)

Recording: (2762/ 9621) 
um i do not i mean there definitely is that image of you know dallas and dynasty i think it is it is worse i think for the the image of the tourist like basically they think anyone who can afford to be over there must be absolutely loaded you know and that was sort of another thing when you know i went to school there is you know i had a scholarship that is how i went there you know and i worked the whole time i was in highschool in college and all this kind of thing but it was just like yeah people just thought oh you are american you are here therefore you must have lots of extra money to throw around and you know they just sort of do not grasp the fact that you know you can have made sacrifices to be there but i do think also in films you know i remember actually being in bristol and that film california with brad pitt and juliette lewis and you know they are in the trailer and everything else and you know their accent and and i remember a bunch of people were sitting in this sort of lounge room watching this and they said like oh you know something like is that what they talk like or is that what it is like in the south and i thought OH MY GOSH you know what an image to have of like the south and you know i was just kind of shocked at this but i think that there you know with you know people who are going to university there and things like that there is not necessarily that opinion maybe you know in a certain sector like when all you have heard is the consumption and everything else there might be more of that idea but i think you know most people like me or whatever they well i should not say like but you know people who have more education sort of not even without having to really think about it but you know there is not just that blatant view i mean i think that it is um the consumption thing like i think a lot more realize now that you know i think americans have this just reputation which is totally true for like spending spending spending and like obviously when you give that a closer look so many people are in debt i mean i think i just saw something else on the news that said you know across the board we do not even break even we are like negative one or something 

Recording: (2763/ 9621)

Recording: (2771/ 9621) 
they went they went to private schools they went to private schools i certainly did not want them to go to public schools and even when going to ohio state um compared to miami university i saw a difference i see a differences in the standards of the of the students uh but i believe and i have seen it with my son going to ohio state that his morals that he is gained through his uh precollege years are staying with him uh and i am very grateful that there is uh spiritual guidance i keep telling these guys guys my daughter and son excuse me that um you know they would come to me for answers now i think now i know that is something that is probably the other problem is sometimes maybe the the the um siblings or the children do not have a parent to go to but again let me reiterate we do not have a smooth marriage they saw us have difficult times and they saw us saw us our spouses crying together forgiving one another arguing with another just as much as you can have a being human relationship they saw that they saw the love for one another they saw over night where i would start take caring for my dad because my mother died instantly you know like short term an hour and now he has a stroke i did not know whether i stay out of their lives and i had to learn all that and i had takecare of him but then they saw my wife taking over some my role at home so we swing them that is why i said a team player we knew what we had do uh my son might come home i said well gee you know he he he might smart off my wife will say hey that is your dad give him respect

especially if you are waiting to go into combat 

Recording: (2802/ 9621) 
i think that is too young to talk about birth control methods and everything but you know with aids and that as rampant it is is now and there are so many more women that have it um started off it was mostly men um women have got to know as at an early age you know about these different diseases and things 

Recording: (2803/ 9621) 
I remember a time when i was brand new teacher i was maybe f fifth or sixth year of teaching that is still pretty new this john i said john what is your last name he said guess i said i do not feel like guessing tell me your last name he said guess i said john i want to know your last name and he said g u e s s <LAUGH> i am like oh sorry thank you

Recording: (2806/ 9621) 
but in the winter is when you know i mean i do not exercise that much 

Recording: (2807/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2808/ 9621) 
it is a no it is a uh clinical study where we are seeing how treadmill training effects ambulation in people with spinal cord injury 

Recording: (2809/ 9621) 
i appreciate your opinions but were you asking did you have we seen a change in the politicians and through our lifetime was that particularly your point 

Recording: (2810/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2811/ 9621) 
hum 

Recording: (2812/ 9621) 
uh do you think there is a heaven 

Recording: (2813/ 9621) 
i think it is harder on him because he is demanding of my attention and i think that is a little harder because he was an only child for nearly five years so it is been an adjustment for him but he loves his baby brother it is it is really he he nurtures him too so it is neat to watch 

Recording: (2814/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2815/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2816/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2817/ 9621) 
here in columbus yeah i have i have always lived in columbus yeah 

Recording: (2818/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2819/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2820/ 9621) 
i went to o u for about three months but i just got out of school you know how it is 

Recording: (2821/ 9621) 
i would just tell him that is just a feeling he is going through who he you know i i have went through that where you know you you look at a woman and you are you she is attractive to you you know but that is just something that is going through your mind and that i think that is like the devil getting into you because i would never sleep with a woman i would never do it even though i might be really would have been real drunk or you know or not drunk and just you know i would just tell him that is something he is going through and that is wrong for him to do that that he you know he is a man and i would tell him god did not put two men on this earth and if he would choose to do that that i would not hate him or disown him or anything like that 

Recording: (2822/ 9621) 
the opportunity to serve one another and uh that is the downfall of our society because we are thinking more of ourself others and i think as as we become older you start thinking about how um much your weaknesses are but really your weaknesses are the strength that you pull from your faith it is not the materialistic things that the university here uh professes to be the thing 

Recording: (2823/ 9621) 
i know and you know and the thing is you are gonna have a a great time with your kids and it is just it is it is it is almost like if it had to be like that for me to realize it and have it like this it is worth it 

Recording: (2824/ 9621) 
mm 

Recording: (2825/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (2826/ 9621) 
i do it so 

Recording: (2827/ 9621) 
he will yeah he will basically tell you he do not have no except for me 

Recording: (2828/ 9621) 
well i 

Recording: (2829/ 9621) 
well as it turned out he expected us to play the solos <LAUGH> or did not play the whole piece we only played one movement of it and um i thought it came out pretty well i have a recording of it for a while there i was worried that we did not get a recording of it and i was really upset <LAUGH> 

Recording: (2830/ 9621) 
right you you you can not really ignore i have heard people say i refuse to read the dispatch well you got to know what is going on locally i am sorry but uh 

Recording: (2831/ 9621) 
and so that is a whole different that is real different from the way it used to be even though it looks the same 

Recording: (2832/ 9621) 
yeah up on bethel road 

Recording: (2833/ 9621) 
if if you did not own let us say on a school levy and you did not uh you you pay taxes i always get because i rent and i always get very upset and i am very angry when people say well you do not hafta pay school taxes yes i do because every time a school tax passes my rent goes up it is built into the rent uh at least it is it ought to be or i have a pretty dumb landlord <LAUGH> uh and i do not i have never lived any place where my rent did not go up after a school levy passed and usually in direct f proportion and beyond you know uh of what the levy was uh so that would be the first thing i would say and then i would also say that you know uh because uh a a a number of reasons that people do not vote for school levies now is because they do not have kids in the schools you know but education is the foundation of a democracy and if you do not have an educated citizenry uh your democracy could go down the drain um that was why thomas jefferson founded so many schools or you know the the university of virginia and believed in education you know because he said without an educated citizenry you will not understand the issues you know but it is very difficult today to get to people um i have talked to some i have almost college age students and they do not see the relationship you can talk logic to them all you want and it is not like the logic gets to them and you can talk history all you want and it does not mean anything to them and i do not know why i wish i did but i do not know why 

Recording: (2834/ 9621) 
i had considered that yes 

Recording: (2835/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah i well i think basically that goes back to uh you know the parenting and everything you know there was something missing in the uh uh the child is life you know uh uh i bet he was not getting perhaps attention uh those kids in particular i do not understand how they could be building bombs in in their basement and mom and dad not know what was going on you know i mean uh it is just tragedy i had a friend when i was a kid too that uh uh we were like i do not know uh eleven years old or something like that well an accidental shooting him in him and the uh another friend of mine from the same same class you know um he pulled a gun and shot him you know and did not know that the damn thing was loaded but and they were talking about another thing about that you know where some kid i guess that happened just here in town uh couple about a week ago or something like that you know where a guy shot another guy but i mean those things are just senseless crimes really you know and who is really to fault and who is really at who is guilty i do not know uh i would like to have uh not that they would ever would have but if if one of the two that you that you know if they would have survived i would like to seen what was going through their heads you know but that is something we will never know 

Recording: (2836/ 9621) 
she did not she did not say anything i mean they would not let her 

Recording: (2837/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (2838/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (2839/ 9621) 
yeah well there is too many situations out there to have everybody fit in to certain ones that just everyone of them is different 

Recording: (2840/ 9621) 
what is different my old neighborhood is just exactly the same and so from that angle was i mean still is my elementary school sitting there i went to for nine years and then north is not being used as a high school but it is there a block away olentangy village i am right in where i always was i mean i am i was raised on como avenue and i live two blocks away from there now so i made a full circle there but columbus has changed in the downtown area and it is really neat you know compared to any other cities course i am i loved oregon i was very rural for eighteen years 

Recording: (2841/ 9621) 
um-hum um-hum 

Recording: (2842/ 9621) 
it is in in education it is it is top they produce a lot of graduate and undergraduate uh education business school is coming up like they are building a new building but by the i will be gone by the time it is done if i decide to stay so it is it will be so as far as uh education like for small school and they just opened up their phd program in education and they are also known for political science but it is a real conservative political science it is a real conservative school and that does not really match my my views on a lot of things um like they it is dry they have uh real strict visitation policies things like that my thought is if you are if you are if you are considered an adult enough to move away then you should not have that many restrictions i can understand some because i remember when i was a freshman in college it was we did crazy things but still 

Recording: (2843/ 9621) 
south pacific yeah 

Recording: (2844/ 9621) 
made you well aware of 

Recording: (2845/ 9621) 
um i think that i do not think that divorce is a bad thing i think that it is if you are married and you realize that you get to a point where you and this other person are are not in a positive relationship for each other or for anybody else in your family that it is better to just say look this is not WORKING we both deserve to be happy and we and and and go your own SEPARATE ways um i think that i i think for me personally i would certainly i would certainly try very hard to be in a situation where i would not end up getting divorced just because i think it makes things a little bit more difficult as far as like coordinating THINGS and i know that sounds kinda petty but just um but i i i i mean i do not think it is i do not think it is bad but i think that that if you can find a way obviously to continue to make a relationship work that you should but my parents are very different 

Recording: (2846/ 9621) 
yeah you can take yeah i mean 

Recording: (2847/ 9621)

Recording: (2856/ 9621) 
and notice how they keep changing packages of your favorite article every now and then um-hum i said but when you get down to the meat of it it is the same thing and i said and that is where it comes down to the catholic church for example they can put all you can have folk masses you can do all this superficial stuff on the thing to make it more attractive and they do every every religion makes it more attractive for her oh as used to come from oh yeah but the bottom line is you are trying to still if you are a christian focus back to the bible 

Recording: (2857/ 9621)

well it depends i think i would like to do new stuff but sometimes i also like to do the old favorites um in the symphony um unfortunately they tend to have budget problems um because a lot of the people in that group are paid um um-hum i get i get paid it is kind of semi professional aspect thing where you get paid per service but um let us see so they have to uh balance the number of rehearsals they can pay people for with the amount of music that they want to do <LAUGH> and uh this last year we played a movement of the shuman concert piece for four horns and orchestra and i was a little bit flabbergasted when i saw that on the schedule at the beginning of the year because it is really hard to play and i thought is he expecting us to play this the solos or is he expecting to bring in somebody <LAUGH> 

Recording: (2902/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2903/ 9621)

Recording: (2908/ 9621) 
i do not think so 

Recording: (2909/ 9621) 
no it it is in uh it is in the ag college but uh why it is there i do not know it is a matter of how they fit it in there but it is dealing with construction management 

Recording: (2910/ 9621) 
but uh but even so the uh we were on this and the germans were up on the mountains all around us where they could again look right down at us so we did not go out in the daylight hardly at all 

Recording: (2911/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (2912/ 9621)

Recording: (2913/ 9621) 
columbus um-hum i went to i up in an alternative school system all along i was i got into the lottery they used i i made it into every school i applied for 

Recording: (2914/ 9621) 
i mean we went in there one day and you know i explained the whole thing to her and and then she puts off some kind of excuse the administrator she says well we do not need problem students like yourself blah blah blah i said what problem 

Recording: (2915/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2916/ 9621)

Recording: (2917/ 9621) 
the 

Recording: (2918/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> yeah 

Recording: (2919/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (2920/ 9621) 
nothing is coming to mind no 

Recording: (2921/ 9621) 
yeah that is what i am saying 

Recording: (2922/ 9621) 
than to do that 

Recording: (2923/ 9621) 
you are allowed to have guests of the same sex like it like i do not live in the dorms but assuming i did if i if i had a girl come from home to visit me i would have to either sneak her in <LAUGH> and like just hope we did not get caught or have her stay at a friends 

Recording: (2924/ 9621) 
my roommate 

Recording: (2925/ 9621) 
the ultimate would probably be a part time thing you know if but neither one of our positions offer any type of part time work we have some friends that do that where they only go two days a week or something which is they get a little bit of both the worlds so 

Recording: (2926/ 9621) 
i she is always trying to recruit people to come and VISIT HER but it is like a two hour drive and then everybody is busy you know that is four hours of driving and um i do not know it is just too hard to keep everybody in touch that way but 

Recording: (2927/ 9621) 
um um i was at eugene and i was not even IN EUGENE it was hundred thousand you know and uh i loved that but i then i came back and i live in olentangy village which is right on the river and it is very uh very scenic very beautiful 

Recording: (2928/ 9621) 
yes um-hum yeah i do miss that but at the same time i have you know i had a lot of opportunity to be there and to do those things so and i mean there there are you know it is obviously you can not compare it but you know there are cultural things to do in columbus and it does sort of make me mad when you know people are kinda like oh columbus you know there is nothing to do there i find myself defending columbus a lot more now than 

Recording: (2929/ 9621) 
home ec i am yeah i am sure that was useful to people that did not cook or do anything it showed them how to turn a oven on or 

Recording: (2930/ 9621) 
um you know was in sixty nines when i went in so you know you can kind of figure that it was the 

Recording: (2931/ 9621) 
oh <LAUGH> 

Recording: (2932/ 9621) 
yeah because there is no fear of being caught by the parents 

Recording: (2933/ 9621) 
um so they sort of send them on their way or whatever and she did have the opportunity to come back 

Recording: (2934/ 9621) 
it is 

Recording: (2935/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2936/ 9621) 
exactly exactly 

Recording: (2937/ 9621) 
there is no issue 

Recording: (2938/ 9621) 
and to me that is considered suburbia so and to me ashland is considered the sticks i mean there is there is amish buggies that go by 

Recording: (2939/ 9621) 
ah i can not i can not believe YOU CAME BACK 

Recording: (2940/ 9621) 
uh hum um-hum 

Recording: (2941/ 9621) 
i talk to her every day 

Recording: (2942/ 9621) 
well i am lucky in that way because um i get travel a lot and it and so you know if there is something i really wanna see chicago is not that far washington is not that far um new york is and i do not get to new york that often but um you know i mean i can i still have access to a lot of stuff if i wanna go to the trouble 

Recording: (2943/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2944/ 9621) 
so that is that is frustrating for me when you look at both of the candidates and you think i do not want either one of these people there should be a none of the above you know if there was uh that option i am sure a lot 

Recording: (2945/ 9621) 
being turned away 

Recording: (2946/ 9621) 
uh-huh his daughter is twelve 

Recording: (2947/ 9621) 
ah probably 

Recording: (2948/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2949/ 9621) 
but now it seems like people are just like i do not know why that is a trend i mean my dad said uh he grew up in the bronx 

Recording: (2950/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (2951/ 9621) 
that is 

Recording: (2952/ 9621) 
so i almost bought one um uh couple weeks ago in fact i went <LAUGH> i went into contract on it with this guy this dear old man whose it was for his mother who was in her nineties in a retirement home was on royal forest which is north and i made this this low offer and i never thought that they would i did not want it was kind of like i felt like i had to do this because i if i was gonna get this house i should get it but i did not really want now because of the baby coming and we are gonna be busy and i did not wanna get involved in and so i made this offer and then he countered back you know i offered him ninety two and he was asking ninety nine nine so he countered back at ninety six and i said that and you know i thought well good now i do not worry about he is never gonna come to it so i wrote back and said you know i appreciate your offer but ninety two i ninety two is is almost not feasible for me and ninety two five was really the only thing i could i i could do and i did not even give him a time to respond because i just just assumed i was just bowing out of it 

Recording: (2953/ 9621) 
um i think it is probably some of both i think it is probably more but i mean obviously they are gonna have different views on how things work um but i mean for the most part i can not see that as being too big of a problem um obviously there are more like violent guys out there and things like that then there are women but at the same time i would not say there is anything too over powerful as far is the the number of guys being out there are violent i mean it is something that unfortunately does happen but i mean it is more how you are brought up whether you can control it or not 

Recording: (2954/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2955/ 9621) 
oh that is almost as bad as rosie cozy i have a 

Recording: (2956/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah 

Recording: (2957/ 9621) 
oh just was going down like 

Recording: (2958/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2959/ 9621) 
um and you kinda knew everybody around the neighborhood but i think that that is still that is still the same for the neighborhood that my family lives in um so i do not i me personally other than other than the fact that maybe there is a couple more things to do there is bigger more comfortable movie theaters and and that kinda stuff it has not really 

Recording: (2960/ 9621) 
usually she is looking for something to eat you know 

Recording: (2961/ 9621) 
sometimes i think it is been a very bad influence on certain aspects of life on others i think it is been very good because at least it lets us know what is going on in the rest of the world and if it were not for that some of the things we would not know and i think that as you increase your knowledge you are far better OFF <LAUGH> THAN to stay in this little hole over here and this is all i wanna know about 

Recording: (2962/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (2963/ 9621) 
um-hum parties did not change at all 

Recording: (2964/ 9621) 
well uh the first THE the first thing is CLINTONVILLE 

Recording: (2965/ 9621) 
i just really think he is 

Recording: (2966/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (2967/ 9621) 
it is really cool yeah yeah 

Recording: (2968/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2969/ 9621) 
um i think they can help but i think it has to be something that society in general or family 

Recording: (2970/ 9621) 
put bathrooms and kitchens and stuff 

Recording: (2971/ 9621) 
i think columbus is really interesting how it how it develops compared to like i do not know just like how like how columbus is different it is a a real standard midwest city just how it is designed and laid out compared to like philadelphia you know or uh just like when it was settled and and when it was made just how like more of the streets are more it is all like planned out more as opposed to like in in philly or places like that more east coast it is like the roads parts of them are real small and like and other parts are all hilly and curving around and stuff and so that is kind of interesting i mean i think it is also odd like the urban sprawl of columbus how it um just the suburbs develop and how it is like more of a metropolitan area as opposed to a centralized area that is really big like our like columbus is downtown it is really odd too i mean there is nothing to do down there it is all businesses and like the couple shops that are down there close at like six i mean there is like couple restaurants or something but i mean it is it is different when you think of other cities you know it is more of like a downtown is where you go to hang out but here it is like campus or more of a 

Recording: (2972/ 9621) 
but i mean it is was nothing too serious or violent i mean 

Recording: (2973/ 9621) 
so everybody is trying to be like everyone else 

Recording: (2974/ 9621) 
oh you do not ask an easy one do you <LAUGH> that is a that is really 

Recording: (2975/ 9621) 
that they do not wear like the loud hawaiian shirts and and you know the shorts and the cameras that the they do they 

Recording: (2976/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2977/ 9621) 
yeah not that they could have stopped it but they they should have known what was going on uh i really think if they were close with their children they would have known something was wrong especially with these kids here are so removed and do not talk to their parents and start dressing certain ways you know that they are you know going a turning a different <LAUGH> you know i just i blame them though 

Recording: (2978/ 9621) 
yeah i hear 

Recording: (2979/ 9621) 
yeah which is good for me because i do not ever go there anyway so 

Recording: (2980/ 9621) 
and you do not have to worry if she writes her name backwards like a mirror image 

Recording: (2981/ 9621) 
and then once month we will have a leadership module which is uh the business ethics part and you know set goal setting and that type thing and then once month we will just have like donatos pizza and like just just discuss basic and just general things we will like events coming up we had we planted the flowers at murfield last weekend and the weekend before was it two i do not know i can not wait for it to start just because i want to watch it on tv and like i planted those <LAUGH> you see the the nick jack nicholas golf statue in front of the clubhouse i planted the flowers around that <LAUGH> no i i do not want to watch it for the golf at all i just want turn it on and see it occasionally 

Recording: (2982/ 9621) 
with nobody around nothing but land 

Recording: (2983/ 9621) 
i would not 

Recording: (2984/ 9621) 
yep i do i really do i mean these kids are getting guns a lot of thems from their parents but um it is amazing how many guns and they say that the police are selling guns to people and they do not realize you know their old guns that they confiscate and they do not realize where they are going i mean that amazes me um but there is always gonna be the underworld and different ways that kids and people can get guns and it is sad i do not know how we could ever limit that but there is so many millions of guns in the world that you know you are wondering where are they all coming from um i think but i think laws can help especially with children and they have these new guns that um not just a safety lock but you know you it is like identification thing you know 

Recording: (2985/ 9621) 
oh really 

Recording: (2986/ 9621) 
oh that was a football game deal 

Recording: (2987/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2988/ 9621) 
and yet we sit down and negotiate for it and then on top of it those people that participate in the um sponsors are just as bad 

Recording: (2989/ 9621) 
excuse me well typically what i observed is conflict you know with mom most of the time uh well i think a lot of times when there is a stepfather involved you know that becomes a problem for some of them but they said you know you might run into a case where you know the family is abusing uh the child you know but i did not run into that 

Recording: (2990/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2991/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (2992/ 9621) 
the that is why it is mainly appealing to in state people you they pay you to go to school 

Recording: (2993/ 9621) 
you know and they did want the children 

Recording: (2994/ 9621)

Recording: (2998/ 9621)

Recording: (3011/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3012/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3013/ 9621)

Recording: (3021/ 9621) 
that is it ah 

Recording: (3022/ 9621) 
i was up i was only on the o p a few times but one time when we had a uh second lieutenant up there who was very well congenial i guess is as good a word as any

Recording: (3031/ 9621) 
no i parked over here on uh uh me see the a section goes back in 

Recording: (3032/ 9621) 
like there would be kids saying yes maam yes maam yes maam in class and then they are out there smoking at the cars or cutting school and STUFF <LAUGH> 

Recording: (3033/ 9621) 
and it would take like years i would think to implement the programs successfully 

Recording: (3034/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (3035/ 9621) 
um-hum life skills <LAUGH> 

Recording: (3036/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3037/ 9621) 
THATS a like there is no there is not a lot you really you can really do with that <LAUGH> 

Recording: (3038/ 9621) 
OH then you would not be too familiar with everything huh 

Recording: (3039/ 9621)

Recording: (3042/ 9621) 
no i had no idea where he was uh and at the time my mother in law was in a nursing home had alzheimers and my father in law was in the hospital 

Recording: (3043/ 9621) 
um-hum uh they have a whole listing of numbers of reasons why you do not want to do it most usually i just put location i do not want to go certain places uh 

Recording: (3044/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3045/ 9621) 
i i think it is because uh when i was a sophomore in high school before it dawned on me that tab a and slot b HAD ANY RELATION to the stuff that we were learning with the charts and the diagrams and um but i think kids are a lot more aware now from because of what they are exposed to you know in movies and everything you know just tv just daily life um either they are a lot more aware they they have i i they they go into it with a lot of of uh myths and misapprehensions but they definitely have thoughts about it and and i think they i think they need to KNOW 

Recording: (3046/ 9621) 
yeah like when i need things and i call him up i need diapers i need wipes i need twenty dollars yeah he is there for me for that financially yeah he is always been there for me 

Recording: (3047/ 9621) 
with her eye or the car accident 

Recording: (3048/ 9621) 
like on a fairly regular basis even 

Recording: (3049/ 9621) 
yeah it is well basically it is like a it is about the size of a very small hotel room and then it is got a separate bathroom with like a big bathtub and there is like a they there like oh it is aroma therapy which is a little box on the wall about this big that has like some smelly stuff coming out of it but i mean there is enough room where people can come and sit down there is like a fold out couch bed for whoever is in there with you and then they have got the baby they keep the baby right there in the room with you after it is born 

Recording: (3050/ 9621) 
it was during school um you would go there you went there for two years your junior and senior year and um like your junior you would go in the morning and your senior you would go in the afternoon but it took up pretty much your whole day half of your day actually you are at the career center and then you go 

Recording: (3051/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (3052/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3053/ 9621) 
just because you know it was more like they seemed like they wanted to be there as opposed to i am just doing this because i do not know why or whatever and it seems like too they they i hate it when people it is obvious that if they did not have the textbook they would not know how to do it you know like where if people did not have their notes like they would not be able to do it themselves you know it is kind of like um and so i think it is that when people have real enthusiasm and like or and put a lot of effort into making it not the same everyday not just like a lecture and when then we do homework and turn it in like you know it is like we do like like in history class we do like role role playing things and like 

Recording: (3054/ 9621) 
yeah exactly which is one of the things i ran into architecture where i mean we only had you know one or two papers we had to write 

Recording: (3055/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3056/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3057/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (3058/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3059/ 9621) 
but it is a uh smaller catholic school you know within saint louis so 

Recording: (3060/ 9621) 
they just can not single out what i should attend to and what i should screen out so they attend to everything equally the train going by out here the teacher talking up here the kid over here shuffling his papers this kid back here picking up his pencil and so they get a little bit of everything and they do not learn anything 

Recording: (3061/ 9621) 
and there is people like that today still you go but i think people should go to um retirement centers uh-huh uh and uh sit down make a visit to them every week make it part of life and develop a friendship

yeah 

Recording: (3079/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (3080/ 9621) 
well yeah i could have just took him out in the woods and whupped him but what is that gonna prove 

Recording: (3081/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (3082/ 9621) 
in your room it is just like forty of any other kind it is plenty 

Recording: (3083/ 9621) 
yeah yeah oh yeah yeah 

Recording: (3084/ 9621) 
um i took a class for word word word processing one and two i took those and um tell you the truth i can not remember if they taught me how to balance a check book out 

Recording: (3085/ 9621) 
oh is he 

Recording: (3086/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3087/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3088/ 9621) 
oh sure 

Recording: (3089/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> YOURE DOING FINE <LAUGH> 

Recording: (3090/ 9621) 
um i probably would like i said just mainly more for the education standpoint of it 

Recording: (3091/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (3092/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (3093/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3094/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (3095/ 9621) 
and i have got friends that do that and i just i do not i do not feel right i do not want to see my kid seeing all these different guys coming around and stuff that is no way huhuh <LAUGH> 

Recording: (3096/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah 

Recording: (3097/ 9621) 
i know THOSE ARE hauls 

Recording: (3098/ 9621) 
so we are kinda doing that and then i figure i am probably gonna wait tables at night <LAUGH> and and finish going to school during the day so 

Recording: (3099/ 9621) 
well he is uh exporting cars illegally 

Recording: (3100/ 9621) 
you know like i told her it is the way i was raised 

Recording: (3101/ 9621) 
that is that is yeah it is developmental because by the did you know the reason they picked the age five to start school it is when some expert thought that one hemisphere or the other was dominant but now they found out that the full dominance does not take over till about age eight 

Recording: (3102/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3103/ 9621) 
that is a big growing period you know from junior high to high school is when you really learn and try to decide what you want to do with your life um my mother was always home she was um which was good to come home to because i had friends whose parent mothers were not there and they had to clean and they had to start dinner and they hated it you know i mean and they feel that they kind of missed out on things um but i think you know kids lot of them who have when they parents have money and um both parents worked i am not sure if the columbine if both parents worked but i do not think just the mother being home there would have totally helped no 

Recording: (3104/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (3105/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (3106/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (3107/ 9621) 
but uh her mother stayed with us for several uh two or three years and she was a baby sitter for our oldest boy 

Recording: (3108/ 9621) 
and it really is not though because once because i think it is actually it is really freeing not to have to drink and all these things so you just kinda i feel like i can get along with any people and so it does not really exclude you from anyone unless you would let it i guess and nobody is perfect i mean everybody has their prejudices i guess and fears so getting over that is a is part of life <LAUGH> for EVERYONE <LAUGH> 

Recording: (3109/ 9621) 
oh yeah uh 

Recording: (3110/ 9621) 
yeah yeah i saw the patients in the morning 

Recording: (3111/ 9621) 
i am a freelance artist um uh illustrator um in fact um marketing communications for ohio state is one is one of my big clients and um uh i also i also have various part time jobs for the medical INSURANCE 

Recording: (3112/ 9621) 
i know it is connected to like you know england because it is like i guess that is i guess uh i maybe like england owned it once so that 

Recording: (3113/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (3114/ 9621) 
and uh it did not hurt me none you know uh i think it just depends upon like i said a lot of factors know it is your neighborhood your neighbors uh most kids do not have nothing to do in their neighborhood even and how many empty lots do you see nowadays it still comes back to like when i was a kid we had go carts we had mini bikes we had all that kind of stuff 

Recording: (3115/ 9621) 
there is a lot more in college college it is seven nights a week 

Recording: (3116/ 9621) 
um-hum and some conservative values too you know that the republicans are supposed to represent but i do not think they they are doing a very good job of that <LAUGH> 

Recording: (3117/ 9621) 
i it is not a presidential candidate issue as far as i am concerned but uh i am 

Recording: (3118/ 9621) 
probably would not have even stopped he is sitting there going what are you doing with this guy and why is he on my car and all this stuff i said i want him arrested man he took my necklace tried take them all radio too and uh you know i kind of threw that in there make it sound bad BUT <LAUGH> i was on my way to work man i did not want it anything bad to happen to me or him you know so all in all the cop you know put guy in handcuffs put him back car he goes well do you want to press charges and at that time i was little bit over my limit with the anger thing i said no just let him out of the car i will beat his ass <LAUGH> oh man the cop said something that i never forget he said i would but that would probably hafta be my job to do if we was living like that <LAUGH> i was like god man rodney king all over again <LAUGH> 

Recording: (3119/ 9621) 
i do not see any reason for it myself but uh that is interesting uh um you know when they when the first when the uh when time began you know according my uh what i believe in and everything you know it was man and woman got married you know and and reason they got married was because of procreation you know keep the keep the uh population going uh i think that is the way it was set up originally so i have no problem with a man being with a man or woman being with a woman but um if if that was the relationship for everybody 

Recording: (3120/ 9621) 
motherly instinct towards you know they are all like oh eric you should have one and you know and he knows KNOWS IM NOT GOING TO HAVE ONE um i just knew at a young age i have always loved the animals 

Recording: (3121/ 9621) 
can you really 

Recording: (3122/ 9621) 
see and i can not eat seafood but i tried some once when i went to las vegas with my and i we did not really have it my mom did not cook it at home which i am kind glad she did not um the smell of fish always kind of bothered me but until i tried some crab meat and lobster and within five minutes i broke out into a rash i mean it was like a heat rash oh it started on my neck 

Recording: (3123/ 9621) 
you know so i figure it is it is much better to be nice to them because there is also times when you know everybody makes errors and you know maybe one of these times you make an error and i tell you to turn one way and you go uh you know like there is an airplane over there and i tell you to turn that way and i really meant for you turn left instead of right and you may come back and go uh do you do you mean left or right there and i go yes that is correct turn left you know so you know everybody helps everybody out you know i i feel kindness goes a long way and the pilots the same way most often they are you know pretty decent 

Recording: (3124/ 9621) 
well i used 

Recording: (3125/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (3126/ 9621) 
yeah uh it is it to me that is sort of a slap on the wrist and you tell the parents what you have done it what the kid did and you do not want him to do it again and let it go they suspended him i do not know course um i probably say this i got this version of the story from the columbus dispatch so it is probably not the whole story yeah it it is 

Recording: (3127/ 9621) 
it is that is why i quit 

Recording: (3128/ 9621) 
ITS LIKE WE do not have one at home because we are worried of THAT 

Recording: (3129/ 9621) 
yeah because i have a like a problem with um getting to know people you know like i am shy at first 

Recording: (3130/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (3131/ 9621) 
humum 

Recording: (3132/ 9621) 
yeah yeah that is pretty much what we was made to do you know back in the pioneer days you did not have this crap with the kid going fix me some canned ravioli or <LAUGH> and you gave that kid a shotgun and he went out there and killed his OWN MEALS <LAUGH> that is an interesting thing i just saw on the in the news week i was reading that and 

Recording: (3133/ 9621) 
uhhum 

Recording: (3134/ 9621) 
uh in psychology 

Recording: (3135/ 9621) 
which i feel has been completely devoiced in america because of the effects of the cold war uh i have inherited this world where there was of uh uh where am i going with this <LAUGH> um i mean the generation before us had like vietnam and protested against it i mean they were in many ways protesting against the generation before but and when it came down to it i mean the what was the protest really about you know and i am not being clear so i am not exactly sure where i am going with this i very cynical of uh about about the world i have inherited uh cause i see a world in which my political views have been silenced by fifty years of of you know like international politics sort of like propaganda um that says you know like to be left of a certain point is bad like among conservative circles the word liberal is is like <LAUGH> almost like calling someone a communist in in the forties um where as i am very cynical about that cause it they feel that it it was not it it it is been a cultural process that has been developed and now i am being handed this current situation which i see is completely unfair i mean i think the reason that our generation is cynical and the reason i am cynical is because we are handed a world in which we see the injustices of the past or not the the the hypocrisy i mean i guess injustice also applies in terms of things like the cold war and stuff but that is why i am cynical i hope that answers your question at least a little bit i do not know i feel kinda preachy <LAUGH> like this is my position 

Recording: (3136/ 9621) 
taking classes hopefully that is when you go to the dentist and you know you catch up on all that stuff too 

Recording: (3137/ 9621)

Recording: (3140/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (3141/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (3142/ 9621) 
that is number um-hum <LAUGH> i have a very general uh opposition to this kind of thing uh no matter where it is anymore uh my being seventy six years of age has a major bearing because i see the uh total destruction of our center cities uh and i say when i speak of center cities i do not necessarily mean just cities the size of columbus is the largest one in the state of ohio now but i am talking places like washington courthouse which maybe have fifteen thousand or um uh wadsworth which maybe have eighteen thousand uh this kinds of thing is being developed on the peripheral of the cities is just totally destroying those and a consequence i feel it is breaking our society down to the point where we do not do not know our neighbors at all anymore the uh it is quite common anymore that if you go three houses down you have no idea who those folks are how they feel what they might do for you or you can do for them uh and that all applies to the polaris question as i see it and i think also that uh it is a it is a very very major financial uh gain for the developers who are doing that and it is going to therefore harm uh the many many areas affected such as north north north north north <LAUGH> WHATS THE NAME OF THE SHOP uh north what northland yeah northland i can not EVEN SAY THE okay 

Recording: (3143/ 9621)

Recording: (3159/ 9621) 
oh <LAUGH> well i was because i was gonna say when you were talking about traveling you will be able to get him to have a job where he can do lots of traveling i know um like my husband goes to europe and goes you know he goes to california every month and and you know he goes as little as possible but the point is if i if we wanted to be traveling he could be going a lot more a lot longer now he just goes for you know a couple days at a time just to get back here because i do not like him to have to well and he does not wanna be away from us but your husband you will be in a position you can he can latch on to something where you will be able to have lots of opportunities to travel 

Recording: (3160/ 9621) 
and plus the mental health aspect of it and everything

but then he disowned me so it does not MATTER <LAUGH> 

Recording: (3173/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3174/ 9621) 
the simplest things 

Recording: (3175/ 9621) 
well we figure in a few years he will um 

Recording: (3176/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3177/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (3178/ 9621) 
well i think they tried to get some kind of a deal with uh when they were planning this thing and with uh with ohio state to uh you know like have the schottenstein center down at uh down closer to downtown or or something like that and play half your ball games there or something like that but but ohio state do not need that you know they got their own stuff so 

Recording: (3179/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3180/ 9621) 
well i do not think they should be responsible i think um kids go to school and they need role models good teachers um and i think schools have gotten a lot better about that it seemed like in the late eighties early nineties you know the schools a lot of them were really bad um i think finally the education department or whatever is realizing that parents need help with their kids they can not do everything and you know they just need really positive things when they do go to school and you know i think teachers are a big part of it i really do you know you remember when you have a good teacher and that you have learned a lot um and i think you know through education because it is hard all these schools in so many rural areas and everything try to get good teachers and then you know it is always have to do with money and them not making enough money which the teachers do not make enough money and they are overworked and all these big large classrooms and it just seems to me when kids start dressing and getting in a clique together you know would be hard for them to intervene and say say oh what is going on in your life what is your what is the problem you know that is that is not really should be their role but um if they care enough they should call the parents and say look we are worried about your son he misses lot of school or he is starting to dress really ynkow i sometimes and it should not be that dress has a lot to do with it but it seems when kids go a different way it does involve dress and just you know turning against the norm of the society you know and if they do not want to be in sports that is fine there are so many different things they can do in in school and learn about arts and music and you know but um unfortunately a lot i think a lot more pressure is on schools to more or less pick up the slack of what the parents can not do but in some ways it is always kind of been like that i mean it was like you went to school and they took care of you until you got home you know i mean 

Recording: (3181/ 9621) 
it is getting so congested it is that is what i do not 

Recording: (3182/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3183/ 9621) 
and it is i like how see like i thought about going to antioch but it was it was really expensive and like um i do not know but just because the and and the school is more of a nontraditional type where they give you like evaluations and you do not get grades like and so so then it that is what that is what i heard it is like at antioch where the professor writes uh like a couple page paper on your like performance on the quarter and that that really shows that i mean that is a lot of work for the professor but like that really shows that he is really involved in noticing what you are doing as opposed to just like some kid in his class you 

Recording: (3184/ 9621) 
well there is been quite a change in attitude of the general public i as far as work women working away from home is concerned and uh i do not know i am glad that my wife was able to work there at home well actually she worked in an office when our first boy was just small

and that is essentially what the supreme court said in their last decision on this two three years ago what they said was whether we think it is right or wrong whether we think the previous supreme court was right or wrong it is been a part of this fabric of this country for more than ten years and to reverse it would create too much too many problems for people you know which i thought was a nice way of saying sorry folks but you know it is too late 

Recording: (3255/ 9621) 
i do not know uh maybe i think maybe if teachers just their status in society is not real high when it should be um it is more like i you know i have heard that like garbage men get paid more than teachers you know and how but it um so it is just like people always talk about you know education for the you know we gotta like think about our child is future or whatever but really teachers are paid crap AND like do not really get a lot of respect from anybody like professors and stuff get get like more of a respect but like it is just like like the teachers that you have especially in elementary school like in critical periods in in your life like in like especially in adolescence too like really influence like how you are as a person and like people do not like take that for granted a lot like if you have bad teachers in one subject you are gonna hate that subject you know and like if you have good teachers you are gonna love it i mean that really influences too like how like what you wanna do with your life you know and people do not really acknowledge that too much 

Recording: (3256/ 9621) 
um kind of uh i mean it was something i was really into uh until i do not know maybe about fourth or fifth grade at which point things sort of switched to you know like i do not know like killer robots or something like transformers that kind of thing uh in high school i uh i do not know i think i cleaned my room or something or cleaned my closet and found my old toys i am like star wars is fun i am gonna watch star wars more often i had them on tape so i started watching them and got i do not wanna say into it because i know people who are really into it i am pretty into it but it is not the same kind of thing i do not think but back when i started doing the the painting uh i i graduated from high school in ninety four just to put things in a little perspective uh so something like my first couple years of college uh from m sort of the second half of high school to my first couple years of college i was just sort of just i do not know i liked the story um 

Recording: (3257/ 9621) 
because they kicked me out for some dumb reason they confused me with somebody else and i ended up taking the blame 

Recording: (3258/ 9621)

Recording: (3260/ 9621) 
um-hum <LAUGH> 

Recording: (3261/ 9621) 
and he does have a responsibility but i think there can be a line drawn to how responsible he is and how capable the other half would have been you know 

Recording: (3262/ 9621) 
because the mother um he played her because he was with me and you know if and she just was like forget him i do not want him to be around my child and the other one she is a older she is they she is like ten and um he says that because his daughter do not call he only she only calls for when she wants things so he does not you know he will he will get whatever he can for her when she calls but he does not spend time with her

Recording: (3275/ 9621) 
oh i was gonna say it would be interesting 

Recording: (3276/ 9621)

Recording: (3281/ 9621) 
in most in most in most school districts it is comparable to any other job now it used to always be low but like a beginning teacher in worthington starts at i think twenty six eight or something course worthington is one of the three highest paid districts in ohio um but it used to be that teachers just got paid lower than a starting fireman or starting policeman and you know you in a sense you are out there risking your life everyday too 

Recording: (3282/ 9621) 
um-hum the watch towers yeah you kind of like you know looking up and says you know is anybody is you know got there sights on me yeah it is because that is a it is like you know like you know that is like the world war two stuff you know there is like the remains of it sure but it is like you get to see the wall it is like there it i mean it is i am sure there is like the there is uh the the what from what i understand there was like you know you know cosantiner wire and barbed wire and all those like a big big uh brick wall and whatever you can actually you know still see it unless they tore it down okay just like to peruse over the history of it okay wow so you actually it is like it is neat it is like because you were like a part of that history at least when you were over they you feel like wow i was it you know something to tell your daughter it is like i was there did you go to scotland see now and i am like i am like depressed <LAUGH> because like well i guess got got few months here now i wanna just go you know it is like when you get psyched up uh i have not decided heck i i because i heard like you know there is some people told me well you know if you wanna be like a you can there is you even like do uh teaching over there like teach english or you gonna be a nanny it is like so you know it is like if i you know the right right right uh position opens up i will just <LAUGH> i might not be be coming back any time soon really not not in australia they have it pretty good <LAUGH> but are you talking about places like like in asia can you really wow okay <LAUGH> and then they can then after that you know the money runs out they come back and then start up teaching wow that is fantastic okay that is that is a that is not uh nothing you do not really hafta have like like like you have to have like like you know like like a doctorate or any like sort of credentials whatsoever as long as you can you know talk the talk um-hum is that right really will they put you they will not put you in front of like a two hundred fifty person lecture hall will they <LAUGH> that that would be hard that would be that would be that would would be a challenge uh i no i never i never looked into that but that is a good suggestion they yeah like like being the the they are gonna be like like spanish instructors no i i never thought about that not until you just just uh just just said it so yeah or like teaching english as a second language i know they teach those classes here so i was thinking well you know maybe i should start looking into like teaching classes i was like well i did not know if that was like true or not that you can actually teach around the world because i have heard i have heard stories you know yeah you can you can get they like people pay i am like but why <LAUGH> but but it is like yeah if you say it is true i will look into it because uh okay is it just like a regular job like forty hour week where where you be okay okay so you think just like one on one where you just like sit like uh like like us doing it or we it is like in a classroom setting just have like a um group conversation okay okay so there is definitely work available if you wanna you know pursue it um-hum you did you visit spain while you were there because that is one of the places i wanna

Recording: (3451/ 9621) 
that is that is really hard to say um if she was a younger woman and ran the campaign that she ran negatives do not work in columbus columbus really does have a heart and that just does not play in columbus what plays in the state and and the people who ran her campaign ran voinovich is campaign and betty montgomery is campaign and and that negative stuff worked statewide that does not work so well in columbus um i i think that it would even a younger woman who ran that particular campaign would have lost um and i like to think that age does not matter but she came across as old to me also and i like to think i am not prejudiced on on any issue but if there is uh someone who had been right on the issues i do not care if she was old i would have voted for her she just did not support the issues i supported she was wrong on uh i i did not like that she tried to use um the police chief in such a negative way by saying that um coleman had voted for a raise for the chief well yes he voted for a raise for the chief but he voted for a raise for the the police officers it is just that you know the police chief is was tied to his and i do not like people who try to manipulate facts uh and and that was manipulating the facts i did not like that she was um uh uh against the the the tiff uh and polaris once it was voted i thought it was more important whether it was right or wrong and i do not think it was wrong to begin with but once it was voted and in place i thought our reputation was on the line and for her to try to use another divisive issue just to get elected did not sit well with me um so i do not even if she had a lot of charisma charisma does not mean as much to me as a person is stand

but that is what they go through 

Recording: (3492/ 9621) 
well i did not necessarily want to BUT THATS WHERE my family started me out they um are alternative to the public schools supposedly um just more i do not know exactly how to explain it the only thing that i know is that i never learned to do anything <LAUGH> 

Recording: (3493/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> um not to sound like a broken record but i really think it is our uh backslide on on family units i think it is too easy to stay and i have been married and divorced so i have unfortunately had that experience to me um that it is too easy to get divorced um people do not really go into marriage with commitment and lifetime and have that i do not wanna say old fashioned values but just the value of this is very important um because lets face it to to me love is a choice because there is times when i do not love my husband i wanna smack him and he is being a little barney but i choose to be in love with him because i made that choice and then that passes and lo and behold an hour later week later what WHATEVER LONG IT takes i am in love with him again i mean really you know what i am saying and um i think it is just too easy to get divorced i do not believe in staying in a marriage for the sake of a just children but i think if you really make that commitment and actually work on it you can have a great relationship you can have kids and bring them up in a more stable environment um unfortunately i think that is the problem parents um are a either getting divorced and then they get caught up in their petty little things and start pitting the kids against each other you know using the kid as a medium um or they are too selfish and do not listen to their kids or they did not i i do not wanna say selfish but lets face it like we said you know even having a dog takes some time out of your your your schedule and um not spend enough time with the kids you know they are working what not and it takes a lot of effort to raise kids these days and actually listen to them and get to know them and let them grow and things like that uh and i do not think enough families are doing that

i went to public um kindergarten through sixth and actually i was quite pleased with the program but my mom also had me in um i do not know it is ccd class it is a it is uh monday nights you go and you get the um basis of the of the church and that was important to me and then um i went to um parochial school for seventh and eighth grade which was in my opinion horrendous but excuse me i think it is the age of the children in general you know the whole puberty thing and going into a new school where these kids had been together since kindergarten and trying to fit in at that age and then i went to parochial i went to um for highschool and that was a very good experience 

Recording: (3741/ 9621) 
right yeah i have run into just a few problems at antrum um since i do like to jog even though i am very slow most of the people that take their dogs there take them off the leash and let them go in the lake and what not which is okay you are not supposed to do that but when i am jogging with my dog on a leash and all the other dogs come up it irritates me 

Recording: (3742/ 9621) 
um no i got to babysit for like a week and then she has a best friend that is watching her baby and a friend of hers that has other kids too so it is real good for the baby

Recording: (3745/ 9621) 
what i am saying when i talk to them or my mother very nice human being and a bunch of people i do not know 

Recording: (3746/ 9621) 
um-hum um-hum 

Recording: (3747/ 9621) 
exactly that is the that is the idea that people get they do not i do not think they realize that how much WORK it is 

Recording: (3748/ 9621) 
green bay packers 

Recording: (3749/ 9621) 
how am i going to tell who is you know trying to butter me up by raising their hand and and asking questions um 

Recording: (3750/ 9621) 
perfect you know or your computer can not tell you that you spelled o n e when you meant to spell w o n 

Recording: (3751/ 9621) 
right that is true 

Recording: (3752/ 9621) 
just like there is a lot of different uh like influences and everything and like there is just a lot of places you can go with it so it is real good 

Recording: (3753/ 9621) 
that and i heard i kind of liked the change they are talking about they are talking about putting underground power lines and taking the poles out 

Recording: (3754/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3755/ 9621) 
yeah i so that is what i want to do just yeah 

Recording: (3756/ 9621) 
yeah yeah i mean maybe break ins are down <LAUGH> or holding up seven elevens are down but then you hear these you know murders 

Recording: (3757/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (3758/ 9621) 
that would just be too scary for me 

Recording: (3759/ 9621) 
as back into into high school 

Recording: (3760/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (3761/ 9621) 
uh westerville yeah so that is difficult for us to deal with 

Recording: (3762/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3763/ 9621) 
that is where we are in our EVOLUTION ON THIS PLANET 

Recording: (3764/ 9621) 
well the the definitely this happened to me when i was in the third grade uh a friend of uh two of our friends were uh uh went home after school we were playing with a gun and everything and one uh one of them shot and killed the other one you know accidentally uh it just goes to you know my dad always had a gun he did not did not have it locked up all the time but you know was not necessarily in the same place all the time either you know i mean so if you were not really looking for it and you know ah you to just happenstance on to it or something you know uh uh i believe nowadays you know that perhaps with the uh with the the guns you know the availability being more people having guns that do not know do not should not have them apparently uh you know they should be uh under lock and key uh and as for the you know the parents somebody is responsible for you know but see then you get in to catch twenty two because of the legislation i mean you can not require i do not see how you can require a <LAUGH> uh a guy who buys a gun to buy a a lock and then buy a safe for the for the gun and and and do all that stuff because that in the case of a burglar comes into your house which is why why you have a gun anyway you have some fear of something like that happening otherwise you should not have one unless you are a sportsman and uh then you know you are it is not gonna be worth it to have the gun in the first place so 

Recording: (3765/ 9621) 
so i pretty much um it is not stressful at uh i it is really easy it is not challenging 

Recording: (3766/ 9621) 
yeah he is yeah he is twenty six 

Recording: (3767/ 9621) 
probably it is you are right i i asked him what language did he have to to learn to GO <LAUGH> 

Recording: (3768/ 9621) 
um i have a great employer and i i got hired in one of the opening lines in the interview conversation is hi i am and in this particular month i am going to europe but i may or may not come back you wanna continue talking he said sure let us keep talking i said okay and then we continued talking so um it is up in the air 

Recording: (3769/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3770/ 9621) 
and he was always like really red faced and the kids would say you know he went out at lunch and got drunk and came back and that was one of the better schools in columbus and you know i just saw a lot of that i just saw a lot of um uh principals driving big fabulous cars and 

Recording: (3771/ 9621) 
well they had a heck of a time beating cincinnati which they probably should have killed and then o u had a heck of a time beating them you know 

Recording: (3772/ 9621) 
and it is really unfortunate for the good workers in there because i mean the people at mirror lake are so great 

Recording: (3773/ 9621) 
i teach a class on thursday nights um how to play with computers i um play games on tuesday nights 

Recording: (3774/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (3775/ 9621) 
yeah there was a lot of them and they were not very good 

Recording: (3776/ 9621) 
oh yes i did vote <LAUGH> 

Recording: (3777/ 9621) 
and um i do not know i think having just having the word honors gives it some kids enough prestige that they do not totally freak out about not going ivy league 

Recording: (3778/ 9621) 
boy i do not know i am thinking you know of the the divorced people i know who have had children and involved and um boy it always seems to me by the time they get to that step it is already you know they have ALREADY been to counseling they have already tried a lot of other things and that they are i do not know whether some kind of court ordered thinking about it <LAUGH> heavy thinking would uh 

Recording: (3779/ 9621) 
that is true books reading well i think it is normal to read books and stuff but you know you are sitting there or you are like reading a magazine did you know what this guy did you know look down at him did you see what this guy did 

Recording: (3780/ 9621) 
and it is really sort of interesting 

Recording: (3781/ 9621) 
yeah but you know i mean that would that is that is CIVILIZATION WIDE <LAUGH> 

Recording: (3782/ 9621) 
oh well 

Recording: (3783/ 9621) 
and uh eventually he he was alright with it he got used to it 

Recording: (3784/ 9621) 
a lot of them they do not want any better they will not want anything different that is all they want 

Recording: (3785/ 9621) 
but uh you know i knew that uh they would already made that promise and there is a lot of businesses that could move out of that area you know and half those taxes come to columbus even if a business is in westerville half the the employees tax are going to um westerville and half are coming columbus 

Recording: (3786/ 9621) 
gun locks are easy to pick you can break into anything uh but when i was a kid too we used go out turkey shoots and i would go hunting all the time so i was pretty familiar with guns my kid uh he grew up he was familiar with guns he also knew not to touch them 

Recording: (3787/ 9621) 
yeah i do not well we just sort of started making a big splash in australia in about the last three years so uh they they may now they may have 

Recording: (3788/ 9621) 
and i am trying to work on my license for skydiving though 

Recording: (3789/ 9621) 
that you would need um like in the old days you know to melt metal they used uh air pumping it through 

Recording: (3790/ 9621) 
not not yet not i mean he will pull himself up on tables and he will like turn around like hey 

Recording: (3791/ 9621) 
because yeah i i hope to uh at forty nine you know i have i have learned a heck of a lot uh lot of things i have would not want to know you know but i think <LAUGH> i think i they have been for the good as long as you you turn them around and and make them a positive statement for you but that is why i would really like to have is the uh uh a bookstore just down around campus you know and people can come in and go over there and relax you know and um-hum 

Recording: (3792/ 9621) 
well uh when i came uh back from oregon my father was very ill and so i did not want full time work and i started substituting out in uh licking county um which paid terribly low there is all these little districts that has a superintendent well no they have two elementaries one middle school and one high school and a superintendent which they do not need you know so they would hire straight out of college always and there there is a law that uh you have to pay for your accumulated time so i could not get a job out there because i had about six years experience they had to pay me for so i came back in to columbus and it is a lot harder to work in columbus public but but um i i know the territory i know where i am GOING <LAUGH> 

Recording: (3793/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (3794/ 9621) 
well basically the same thing here but some of your management is real good i have seen people that that you know are super but i have seen people that are bad problem is you get a bad management and it can make your life hell i do not care who you are 

Recording: (3795/ 9621) 
um so he is he is learning about the computer now it is gonna be kind of a hobby UNKNOWN WORD <LAUGH> THING <LAUGH> least it is not a work thing but i know we can do lot of things for our house 

Recording: (3796/ 9621) 
ew and i hate hearing myself on TAPE TOO <LAUGH> 

Recording: (3797/ 9621) 
i you know maybe i am oblivious to things but i mean i mean seems like there is lot of worse places 

Recording: (3798/ 9621) 
i do not know i do not know if i could trust him you know 

Recording: (3799/ 9621)

uh uh okay wait you know where the schott is 

Recording: (3801/ 9621) 
i will stay yeah i am in a uh in the guinea pig class of this program through the medical school where after three years of undergrad i go to med school here like without m cats or anything 

Recording: (3802/ 9621) 
could see it they they could be ducking i mean you know you seventy seven years old i can not imagine being hurt by him you know 

Recording: (3803/ 9621) 
yeah you can not say a noun is always gonna be orange and it is gonna be slippery <LAUGH> YKNOW WHAT I MEAN language is so much more abstract than math and science so the abstract areas like history and english and reading and literature that is where these kids have their problems because their disability is usually rooted in somewhere in the languages they either can not write can not read can not spell can not do all three or are not very good at any of them once in a while you will see a good speller because he can remember the order in which the letters come but he might be a horrible reader and a horrible writer even though he can spell yeah and his comprehension of the words of other kids his age would not be what it should be generally speaking my kids are two to four years behind 

Recording: (3804/ 9621) 
um-hum is 

Recording: (3805/ 9621) 
no i did not really start out as a teacher i started out as a speech and hearing therapist but they kept giving me these kids that i could not keep them in the chair long enough to do the speech therapy with them so i got interested in the hyper activity and so i started taking classes about any kids with a d h d and stuff and little by little first thing you know i had my masters in learning disabilities it was mostly just so i could learn how to keep the kids in their seat long enough to do the speech therapy and then when i found out there were so many openings in special ed so and then i found out later that speech therapy is a very good background for l d because a lot of these l d kids have language deficits and language problems they they can not you know like express themselves on paper or they do not process things correctly auditorially so it is the perfect background to work with l d kids i did not know i was doing that at the time but 

Recording: (3806/ 9621) 
sure well that and they like tuesday when we were blessed with the turn of events of weather there she came in and i i was reading a book and i let her out and i let her back in and i started reading again and i am looking around and here is mud so it is kind of good in a way because it kind of well you know you live here it is not the big of a deal you know because i know my sister would freak <LAUGH> i am like

um-hum 

Recording: (3808/ 9621) 
well the it was just communication was not there 

Recording: (3809/ 9621) 
well i think it is more capable of being violent because of the uh information available to people about bombs and stuff like that you know or before you know if somebody got mad at somebody you know you might they might shoot them or something but not kill a hundred innocent people for no reason 

Recording: (3810/ 9621) 
so i have a house

Recording: (3936/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (3937/ 9621) 
oh yeah i have been doing it i have been there twenty over twenty years so yeah i am enjoying it it is always changing 

Recording: (3938/ 9621) 
see i live close to 

Recording: (3939/ 9621) 
oh i am i am sure of the fact that my parents um my mother tried tries really hard but my my father was an alcoholic he was a working alcoholic so that he insisted you know he he could drink on the weekends and never miss work etcetera yeah there was no problem and uh um but the biggest problem is the fact that he and i i um i i i have always expected to have some sort of a respect from them and because they always wanted me to grow up and be independent and think for myself and so i am exactly what they always said they wanted it is just that they can not handle that and so when i was in seventh grade and i got a lot in a lot of trouble about um the racial thing because uh i am from a school where i was mostly white students were 

Recording: (3940/ 9621) 
but you can make them aware if somebody as an adult steps over that line or makes them uncomfortable you know there should be some kind of a s a system to where these girls the slightest bit you know it is anonymous it is you know 

Recording: (3941/ 9621) 
yeah uh my brother did not know what the heck to do with a check book 

Recording: (3942/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3943/ 9621) 
um-hum uh we actually were from columbus we moved down to athens and then uh they moved back up here when i was in the service airforce um-hum mm i was in sixty nine to seventy two so um then i was in two years reserves uh uh basically uh electronic engineering not not an engineer but electronic assembly and stuff like that and this was systems analyst was what it was called but they have got these big names for things um-hum 

Recording: (3944/ 9621) 
to tell you truth the school i went to sucked it i mean 

Recording: (3945/ 9621) 
would be would be interested in i mean i mean not just for the kids sake but but would be interested on their own behalf in in teaching the child what uh 

Recording: (3946/ 9621) 
it 

Recording: (3947/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (3948/ 9621) 
she was but i had admired her more <LAUGH> yeah because um uh until the moderates get control of the republican party again that is gonna be the litmus test and it is just like back in in the sixties and the seventies when the extreme left wing had control of the democratic party they would nominate such people as uh mcgovern who had not you know who i voted for but had no chance of winning over the years i have moderated my hardline left of center liberal stance for more of a moderate middle of the road because it is easier to get that sold to the american public um so uh while i think dole was correct um i think she yeah she shot herself in the foot i do not she would have never gotten the nomination as long as the party remains the way that it is being controlled by the extreme right wing which is a problem for the republicans they moved they need to move towards the middle which i think george w is trying to do um uh uh whenever anybody tells me that i go tell i tell them yes and i am an uh an indifferent liberal 

Recording: (3949/ 9621) 
and they have met the couple that is gonna adopt the baby which seems kind of odd to me but 

Recording: (3950/ 9621)

okay i am thinking people who who back pack are pretty cool you know 

Recording: (3956/ 9621) 
i do not think forcing prayer on somebody if they do not believe in it i do not think that is the right thing to do but 

Recording: (3957/ 9621) 
no because they are gonna learn that on their own um i personally think that it is a choice i do not think you are born that way because i i have friends that are homosexual and um you know i do not believe in what they are doing but I DONT do everything right everyday so i still love them and they are my friends and blah blah blah because but i have also known people that were that way and now are heterosexual and are much happier and they realize that it was just a choice they made and things like that um so it is in today is day and age they are gonna learn about it quickly 

Recording: (3958/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3959/ 9621) 
um-hum does not that is a bunch of <LAUGH> that is just one of those myths <LAUGH> i think that is to make people feel guilty or something

it is like let us go come on <LAUGH> <LAUGH> well yeah because uh i would have had lots of epidural ONLY because they induced me because my doctor said hey it is time we can do this so i got it lucky even though i kind of wanted it have it you know normal 

Recording: (4015/ 9621) 
all right 

Recording: (4016/ 9621) 
oh okay 

Recording: (4017/ 9621) 
issues so um you know that is one thing that that i hope that they they work on 

Recording: (4018/ 9621) 
well it would have been something that they would have supported and something that i would have probably been pretty good at 

Recording: (4019/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4020/ 9621) 
what is bad about where i work at it is it is not so much racism as whereas if you are my supervisor i am just using as an example and i do something wrong 

Recording: (4021/ 9621) 
she read my notes and all that 

Recording: (4022/ 9621) 
so i made a LOT OF STUPID you know you look back and you see things you were like this is real obvious but at the time i think you i was like um a i can either change them or if they love me we can communicate and change things and you know that type of thing 

Recording: (4023/ 9621) 
and then you come here you know what i mean you see people standing out on street corners with signs work for food 

Recording: (4024/ 9621) 
oh yeah i think it is possible it would have to take the right combination of uh someone who can appeal to the party people and get the nomination and appeal to the people i think dole would have been a good candidate i would have been hard pressed i mean uh to some of her issues i do not like but when she came out uh and said her her her famous thing on the abortion issue when she came out against guns uh she went up a couple of notches in in in my estimation because i was not sure where she would be i thought she would have to sell herself as hardline with the hardline republicans and then i would not have been able to vote for her 

Recording: (4025/ 9621) 
and and she is very determined uh she has said that having this being pregnant having this baby has made her focus on things a lot differently she she does not wanna go back to being the way she was before she does not want go back to the the drugs and the smoking and the drinking 

Recording: (4026/ 9621) 
great guy but he sure liked to get drunk you know and the problem was he would turn into such a jerk 

Recording: (4027/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4028/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4029/ 9621)

Recording: (4030/ 9621) 
yeah being a nurse the wife that helps a lot because that is what that thing was really functioning around was nurses getting them some good daycare because they work all these wild shifts and stuff so that is how it first started before it you was not even on campus it was over on like fourth or summit in a church when it first started but you know it is just not you know people are always saying i can not believe how much you pay for daycare and i am like but look what we are getting you know people take their kids to somebody is neighbor is house and the lady can be sitting them in front of the tv and 

Recording: (4031/ 9621) 
than than they were raised and they are but i told her i you know there is not i will never be married if my man is gonna be cheating on me i will not marry him 

Recording: (4032/ 9621) 
right and he just pretty much cut ties with all of his old friends and we still see them all uh a lot and we were close with their parents and 

Recording: (4033/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4034/ 9621) 
oh i see well that would be a good way i would think 

Recording: (4035/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> whole lot more places to live seems like everywhere i turn there is construction and and you know you go down one one road and then you wait a couple years if you do not go in that area and it is all changed looks all different so and that is mainly like looking at bethel and three fifteen north things like that 

Recording: (4036/ 9621)

Recording: (4037/ 9621) 
get it from us so 

Recording: (4038/ 9621) 
i defended my stepmother uh against the rest of my family immediately following my father is death because there was ah some bitterness between the rest of my family and my stepmother so my sister and i defended my stepmother against the rest of my family stepmother eventually shafted us and so stepmother is evil 

Recording: (4039/ 9621) 
right and then they wonder you know i do not know what is happened it is the other person who is changed you know and if you if you start changing your behavior you can usually get the kinds of changes i always figure if you treat people the way that old golden rule thing if you if you give out what you want back you get it

Recording: (4080/ 9621) 
huh 

Recording: (4081/ 9621) 
the parents have so much responsibility but the kid has so much responsibility and then society has so much responsibility so you know what i mean basically all that all i have ever seen is well like these kids that get in the house they go to the house they find a gun and they wanna hold the parents responsible yes and no on that if the parents had the gun in the house they had the uh ammunition locked up say in the trunk of their car what if the kid bought the ammunition from somewhere else and picked the gun lock off the gun 

Recording: (4082/ 9621) 
or i gotta drive you know further north so there is not any like really good businesses right around where i live that is the only thing so i think they need to come in you know redo you know get the downtown going when i was a kid i loved to go downtown 

Recording: (4083/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4084/ 9621) 
i am just saying you know <LAUGH> 

Recording: (4085/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4086/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4087/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4088/ 9621) 
like a little papoose 

Recording: (4089/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (4090/ 9621) 
they were all around the same age you know and going to college my daughter julie does uh is very active though in um not necessarily that she has adopted two her two children so she is become very active in the adoption procedure in tulsa and uh 

Recording: (4091/ 9621)

Recording: (4092/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4093/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4094/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4095/ 9621) 
that would be fine but again uh i do not it is just another person with a different lifestyle it is like they are they are they are the same as me it is just 

Recording: (4096/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4097/ 9621) 
no i would just uh basically got out of a a a relationship it was like a rebound type thing um i was in a relationship for like three years and um he was cheating on me and so i felt really bad and why does he pick her and and then i met this guy who seemed wonderful and then turned out to be not so wonderful 

Recording: (4098/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4099/ 9621) 
uh edward the fourth 

Recording: (4100/ 9621) 
they had on the news most people keep the house five to seven years before they sell it and move on 

Recording: (4101/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4102/ 9621) 
uh i would either go back in uh languages or actually i am a psychology UNDERGRAD SO <LAUGH> yeah 

Recording: (4103/ 9621) 
because like i think it is archie griffin that went to a really crummy school in uh in in columbus and to me no matter how bad of an area you live in and and bad a bad a school you think you are going to if you want to do it you can because it and really in columbus public schools if you have a learning disability or you know if you have problems reading or you have problems at home there is a psychologist or a tutor or something to help you and and in uh like worthington and westerville dublin you know they do not have the money to throw away and like catholic schools they do not have the money to put on those programs so some of those people kind of get pushed aside and so you know as you can see i am standing on my soapbox here i do like columbus public schools but you know i i i hate when people say you know look at these test scores because it really does not reflect what is there because it is like saying all kids carry guns to school they do not you know and the media says well what has there been like maybe five or six people who have taken guns to school and killed people well what about the uh millions and millions of kids that go to school every day do their homework and you know do community service and stuff well well well that is just to boring we do not want to hear that stuff you know it is like that that irritates me <LAUGH> 

Recording: (4104/ 9621) 
yeah we did a lot of searching when we bought our house yeah it is hard to find what you want in a house and get the school system too you get in to arlington you get in to grandview places like this or bexley and the price range we were in you were gonna have to dump fifty thousand in to the houses just to get them up you know we had a list of what we wanted in a house and our house was only seventeen years old when we bought it but it had everything we wanted fireplace full dry basement you know two and a half car garage you know all the stuff that we wanted when a lot of the older houses wet basements garage burned down or you know the lots were packed so we live on a golf course and have a creek in the back yard and so it is really yeah they do not yeah they play in the creek they do not play golf yet <LAUGH> 

Recording: (4105/ 9621) 
i do not know you know columbus is so saturated with golf courses and my parents all through growing up they played golf and i really was interested in it um i just think enoughs enough so i yeah there is so many but 

Recording: (4106/ 9621) 
i mean you could cut paper with this kind of rain ITS just coming down all over the place hail and lightning 

Recording: (4107/ 9621) 
yeah i have to take organic i have to take um biology chemistry physics and then um i have to complete a major if it is biology i get a break i do not uh i only have to take twenty nine hours of it

she has no she has not worked since my sister megan was born and megan is twenty so she but the thing is i have got another i have got a a sister my sister megan um joe is my brother he is fifteen and a half and then i have a sister vanessa who is twelve 

Recording: (4110/ 9621) 
oh clinton is position on it well he sort of backed down from what it was gonna be and then just hoped that it would drop and i mean what what you hear and read lately is that it really has not changed much uh and it but again that is i think part of that too is society is not ready on some level to accept that i mean gays in the military is one thing but then people are talking about gay marriages and 

Recording: (4111/ 9621) 
correct 

Recording: (4112/ 9621) 
those are the mass people you gotta find out and figure out what needs they are gonna roll into like when they get older you know you get into the wheel CHAIR COMPANIES OR SOMETHING YKNOW somewhere it is just gonna be massive 

Recording: (4113/ 9621) 
probably a little bit 

Recording: (4114/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4115/ 9621) 
and and that what they say that we have done to the language and everything else and and you are not a typical american BUT YKNOW and then the next hour and a half they just say how bad americans are and you kind of think like well thanks for the exclusion but YOU STILL HAVE BEEN INSULTING ME FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF 

Recording: (4116/ 9621) 
yeah well it is got a lot worse uh when i say a lot worse because if you know you say you do not have kids i got a kid twenty three years old and there was no place for him to play 

Recording: (4117/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (4118/ 9621) 
well and it is not just in the schools it is in society um i mean violence seems to be an answer to a lot of things and i it is i i just can not it is hard to imagine that the there is an easy fix if there is a fix i it is kinda frustrating because you can not point to one thing and say this is what needs to be fixed you know it is pervasive uh it is like the i do not know if you have heard about this in the news a woman two of them were having an argument and one of one of them set fire to the other one 

Recording: (4119/ 9621) 
did he really 

Recording: (4120/ 9621) 
oh okay i thought well what you know because like some 

Recording: (4121/ 9621) 
he uh told he never said much about it except he told about one time when he was in the hospital up in japan after he was burned he said that he was in a ward with a bunch of other burn patients and and he said the some of them and him included were able to get up and walk around so the and i can see their philosophy the medics had the guys that could walk help wait on the guys that were bed bound and uh he was had been helping one guy that was pretty bad off and this guy passed away did not make it and so they started to put orrin get warren to do something else with some of the other guys i am through i am not working anymore with them he told them and they swore yes you are he said what are you gonna do send me back over to vietnam <LAUGH> but they sent him home but he was he was uh not a very enthusiastic soldier i do not think at any time and especially after he came home 

Recording: (4122/ 9621) 
and that was very stressful 

Recording: (4123/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4124/ 9621) 
AND SO when shortly after he was healed enough to go back to work why they were married 

Recording: (4125/ 9621)

it is more feasible than a six year old 

Recording: (4193/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4194/ 9621) 
YEAH <LAUGH> exactly so you know once you once you get to a certain degree of uh frustration you need to relieve that somehow so that is pretty much why we moved 

Recording: (4195/ 9621) 
i have always thought that it it ends up being a personal decision 

Recording: (4196/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4197/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4198/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4199/ 9621) 
and they see the same thing it is mirrored back to them because we are made in christ is images and we can not say no to him that is what heaven is like that is what we should go to bed at night thinking what did we do positive today and build on the positive it may be the smallest part of that sheet of paper 

Recording: (4200/ 9621) 
but she was never interested in and never really interested in boys or in sports in high school or uh make up and clothes and things like that and you know you are setting yourself up for ridicule in high school for that and that is what happened she would come home in tears because kids made fun of her and stuff and finally she just stopped going and within a couple months she got her g e d 

Recording: (4201/ 9621) 
uh i was going through a divorce parents both parents passed away uh my ex moved to saint louis did not tell me anything about it or foreclosing on the house and that is how i found out she moved and just a bunch of shit and i just started uh screwing up so they wanted to put me on probation and my uh rebellious attitude or whatever said i quit was pretty stupid really but 

Recording: (4202/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4203/ 9621) 
yeah they are they are really good about that 

Recording: (4204/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (4205/ 9621) 
those were the good old days that is a good old day that is when you used to own them too you could trade them that that is when we lost our rights <LAUGH> there are some things that are traditional that are capital t and some are little t little case t and you are talking about little t case t i am talking about capital t 

Recording: (4206/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (4207/ 9621) 
i was going then relate to a comment that she made about i believe in the electric chair i believe in uh capital punishment uh uh but that was one comment she was talking about but then on the very very opposite extreme uh extreme opposite we talk about the love of the child from the day of birth and this may seem to be contradictory and i am not quite sure how to address that because in a in in some some people would say now wait a minute you are talking out of out both sides your mouth the expression is how can you say over here you must have the love of this child in your arms and and then over here you are saying you believe in capital punishment and electrocution 

Recording: (4208/ 9621) 
i think example is probably the best um they see that you care and they learn to care i think my son john he is the youngest i think he is a very compassionate soul uh very spiritual young man um more so than his brother is and i always have ah have to weigh that you know they say that sometimes you give because it makes you you feel better to give and i sometimes try to weigh that if that is part of why i i i i can not believe it it is an attention getter because there is nothing to be gained by getting attention for the works you do but um but maybe just within maybe one feels um and i think i think it it is a matter of being conscientious too you know conscientious that there are 

Recording: (4209/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (4210/ 9621) 
it is quite possible but we the day care that i thought was closest to well the one that was OPEN THAT had the closest values that we had um i personally would like a church based program but uh there are not any well there were not any open when we were looking for one um we did have the option of going here to o s u to their day care and it has a wonderful reputation an everybody that i have talked to that has had children there is very pleased with the program but what i did not like was so that if they were not um imparting values on the children they do not celebrate any holidays at all so they just kind of ignore everything where he is now i still like getting my mother is day card in i mean they are doing trick or treat thing on thursday they are going door to door they get to dress up or he would not have gotten any of that at o s u and there pros and cons to to both of those but 

Recording: (4211/ 9621) 
well it beats getting a second job 

Recording: (4212/ 9621) 
like it is okay i mean it is like a country school which was always real weird too i was always like me and like my friends were always like the because i used to have real long hair and so that was like i used to be like a big hippie or whatever and like um that was i guess weird kind of like being the odd people in a in a small like in a small midwestern farming school it is kind of odd i guess um i do not know um 

Recording: (4213/ 9621)

Recording: (4216/ 9621) 
and getting back to the profanity and stuff that was another one was in the paper some of the parents are not leading the children right and it was about this mother and father was doing something all at once their little kid maybe six or seven or eight walked in there and said what the h you know four letter word is this for and the father stand and looks stunned and after the kid is out says to mother well where in the h did that child learn to talk like that so you see GAVE himself away RIGHT away so you see it is the one it is the ones that are teaching the kids and it is it is all those things that i have mentioned before but i think that really it what can we do to change it i think as i said it basically everybody has to learn to think of the other person and what is good for everybody not just me me me 

Recording: (4217/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (4218/ 9621) 
you know they can do whatever they want 

Recording: (4219/ 9621) 
the proficiency tests that they are now requiring you can not graduate from an ohio high school with a uh with a diploma unless you pass all the proficiency tests and that means you have to take one in citizenship which is like government and history one in math one in science one in writing and one in reading and you have you can try to pass the first time in the at the end of the eighth grade and you get two tries in the ninth grade two tries in the tenth two in the eleventh two in the twelfth you can take them as many times as you need to take them but if you do not pass them all by the time you graduate you get this nifty little thing called an attendance certificate it is not a real diploma it is like okay i attended i did not learn anything but i was there

Recording: (4302/ 9621) 
well this is about giving opinions and my opinion about the columbus public school system really is not good 

Recording: (4303/ 9621) 
well that is what everybody when i tell people i play that is what everybody says but it seems to me that any instrument CAN BE HARD <LAUGH> depending i mean i can not see how anybody can play a clarinet for example <LAUGH> but there some things that are hard about playing the french horn one is that you can play many different notes with a single fingering 

Recording: (4304/ 9621)

she was originally from southern ohio but uh when i was gone she came to columbus and so i came here when i was discharged and i uh served an apprenticeship in a sheet metal worker shop or well it was more than just i mean there is more than shop work we did erection work too and commercial work and uh i stayed with that until uh well for twenty five years however <LAUGH> whenever that was then i got a chance to uh go to work for the city of columbus as a heating and ventilating inspector and i decided that it was that was more my speed when i was that age so i worked for them for the city as a inspector for twelve and a half years till i retired and uh my wife and i had four children four or three boys and a daughter my sons all live here in columbus and my daughter is out in seattle in the redmond area i have been active in church work sunday school all my life 

Recording: (4307/ 9621) 
well i think it starts with the family but the problem is in the last thirty years we have emphasized uh not i should not say thirty years post world war two post world war two is where we broke the family up and let me tell you how i i analyze this during world war two we took the little lady out of the house and said hey we need you on the production lines making war machineries 

Recording: (4308/ 9621) 
and it is just like been so for him too uh this has been you know uh uh a real amazing road because by the time he was twenty eight he had four kids and you know and and yet you know we managed to to work through all that together and be with these kids and have this this kind of time we have now he is looking forward to he is thrilled about the the baby that my daughter is gonna have but um i would have had a whole lot more kids you know i would have just kept having them and he said oh four is plenty you know he needed a break 

Recording: (4309/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (4310/ 9621)

Recording: (4319/ 9621) 
i have become visually desensitized to like the violence that i see in movies and on tv but i still see a distinct difference between that and real violence um i mean in studying history i am exposed to a number of like rather gruesome events in history that still are very i still find disturbing um also hang out in low life bars and every once in a while there will be a fight and it it still it i mean it it it still is disturbing to me i i am i have a distinct difference in my head between reality and fiction and maybe kids like are not making that distinction but i i i do not think so and i think if if someone is not making that distinction it is <vocniose> i do not know that that they are not well i i do not know i do not have any evidence to uh to support it i just know that i have it i feel that i have a distinct uh uh uh very clear distinction between what is uh fact and what is fiction what is true and what is imaginary and uh so for me i do not think that television has affected me in that way um i mean one way that television has affected me is i am full of media references when i speak you know when i am hanging out with friends someone mentions a a subject i am like hey simpsons made fun of that you know at some point ah uh that is the effect that it sees on me i do not think that is too big an effect people always used to you know like quote shakespeare or something i guess that is ten times more elevated so like oh references that shakespeare line or something but i mean it it is a part of our culture and i am a part of it 

Recording: (4320/ 9621)

Recording: (4373/ 9621) 
that is the appalachia area yeah um-hum it would be great if somebody you know they gonna want to pump all this money into it but unfortunately whenever the government pumps money into an area you know that tends to be like a uh foreign country gets it you know and 

Recording: (4374/ 9621) 
yeah well i figure right now i might as well take advantage of it 

Recording: (4375/ 9621) 
um i would say it does not REALLY MATTER either way honestly i mean fact of the matter is they are so deal with it i mean get over it i mean 

Recording: (4376/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4377/ 9621) 
yeah teach one person one thing and not teach the other person that kind of let me see here give an example there is uh there is a school that they showed on twenty twenty somewhere out west i believe it is nevada or somewhere and they said that these uh teachers have the highest rating among many other teachers in the nation because of their actual sitting down and hands on critiquing these children like uh ex girlfriend of mine she was pretty much i would not put her borderline illiterate but she did not know how to read or write 

Recording: (4378/ 9621)

Recording: (4385/ 9621) 
something to think about 

Recording: (4386/ 9621) 
yeah it is worth more what i can not understand is some people live in upper arlington and they send their kids to PRIVATE SCHOOL

a nurse practitioner has more authority i guess to diagnose and see patients um the state of ohio is i think the only state that has a given um nurse practitioners prescriptive authority where we can write our own prescriptions so we can see patients do the physicals we can uh suggest medications i guess per se but then the physician has to come in confirm our findings and then he actually writes the prescriptions 

Recording: (4399/ 9621)

Recording: (4403/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (4404/ 9621) 
well yeah that is kind of subjective although there is a paper that we hand out to our kids that is tells exactly what is supposed to be in every part of this essay like the first the introductory paragraph is supposed to consist of a way to capture the reader is attention it is suppose to supply background information it is supposed to state your thesis statement which tells mainly what the paper is gonna be about and then you are supposed to end the introductory paragraph by listing three ideas about your thesis that you are going to develop in paragraphs two three and four so i mean it is 

Recording: (4405/ 9621)

um-hum 

Recording: (4439/ 9621) 
his speed was like say seventy mile an hour before and now it is gonna be twenty because he does not know how to do it and that is the problem they are running into they have all these qualified people who know how to separate airplanes and how to get them in trail and you know everything but now they have gotta do this extra part which is going to make their job easier down the road but everybody hates change so what they are doing now is it they are having problems because people can not take the volume of airplanes because they are trying to keep up with the computer so it is making it even slower yet but once they get in you know in the swing of things it will be okay but you know you are you are talking a while you know because it is not something that you can do overnight but it would be like your dad learning the computer he is not going to do it overnight 

Recording: (4440/ 9621) 
and um apparently when you are a car um they have a very very like zero tolerance

Recording: (4446/ 9621) 
again with the news reports with uh um different bombings and the i think the jewish school caught my attention and now that he is in daycare i mean we did a pretty good screening but you still always kind of wonder what is going on he is done quite well he is i mean he is learned how to use scissors how to color he is socially learning how to play with other kids those were all things he was not doing at home potty training is been a big deal because all the other kids in class are doing it and

if they are especially if they are over forty because their company is giving money back to the community for this and that and you know that is how they are trying to show that they care about this they are trying to mentor some school or some group of kids or give money for the downtrodden or you know but you are right i think it is terrible that every other country in the world has higher math skills than we do better science skills than we do better language than we do why canadians even go to school for thirteen years not twelve you know and i just think that this proficiency thing is finally going to make people accountable 

Recording: (4451/ 9621) 
anyway and um i am not saying in general but with the experiences that i have had um certain families where they do not uh socioeconomically just not as well off

Recording: (4474/ 9621) 
for people to read i think there is enough other resources out there if somebody is interested in getting that kind of information that they can do that um i know for for me just because i have so many younger brothers and sisters and and my FAMILY AND everything i know how i have got some some some what i feel are pretty good opinions about how to handle different things and i know that my mom always consults me you know like my sister you know she got her the d in french which vanessa is just she is this girl is almost creepy she is so bright i mean she really is thing is one of those things were she just does not turn in her stuff you know and if she is twelve

<LAUGH> 

Recording: (4533/ 9621) 
and move on um that is that is basically my fear but uh as one of the guys tried to help me he said well listen i am afraid of that too and he said because right there in that pit there that is god now if you remember that there is nothing in here that can hurt you even as hot as it gets you know and when you think about that you try not to think too much while you are in there although it is hard to do especially if you are thinking about how hot it is but if you are listening to people praying and they are praying with their heart and i tell you because of how hot it gets in there you will hear people pray straight from their heart not a bunch of real fancy words in a real comfortable setting you know that that heat

Recording: (4543/ 9621)

exactly 

Recording: (4579/ 9621)

Recording: (4580/ 9621) 
yeah i think so um met quite a few people from cleveland and then my roommate is from north canton 

Recording: (4581/ 9621) 
mother used to be a principal of mine in elementary school so uh he is like i think we should talk was like okay great okay so i was like boy you are way too serious for this particular affair okay that is we knew ahead of time this also coming to an end do not worry about it so i i um at this point in the story i should point out that the paper that i went downstairs for i do not know where that is i never found it never saw it never it it is anyway not relevant at all the story but it bugs me every time i tell the story because does not exist anyway so we come back inside and he is like well i have got some bad news and my sister is like why like all okay go ahead and he is like no i i think you should sit down i am like all right 

Recording: (4582/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> yeah <LAUGH>

we have uh yeah we have 

Recording: (4584/ 9621) 
the herbs <LAUGH> the herbs 

Recording: (4585/ 9621) 
i used to when i was driving now uh especially when i was going through the uh going to two seventy things you know i had people flip me off and stuff like that and i had a funny thing one time a guy flipped me off because he was going slow and uh i got all pissed off about him and went around him and everything you know and i go to work pull in at ashland chemical and who pulls in beside me but him i look over at him he looks at me like oh you know i am sorry i mean you know i was 

Recording: (4586/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah it is supposed to be an alternative type to the public schools where they can hopefully get a little bit more of the discipline that they might have not 

Recording: (4587/ 9621) 
i think more what they need to do is in strict or uh just make stiffer penalties to people that carry the guns or that are involved in shootings and things like that um because i mean for the most part i mean people really do not get too badly punished for things i mean if you look in other countries i mean like people like the asian countries places like that i mean they have really strict laws i mean if you even get caught for like vandalism you are still serving jail time and you get <LAUGH> you get pretty badly punished for it i mean some cases they will even chain you up and beat you in public for it um i think not to sound too vengeful but i think if more things went that way that there would be a much less problem with it um i think just the fact that the jails are so over crowded now that they know that they are gonna get good time and parole and all sorts of stuff that if you shoot someone you are you are not even gonna get thirty days in jail and you are gonna be let go i mean that is an awfully small price to pay for 

Recording: (4588/ 9621) 
i am just more of a conservative person i mean i am not sure exactly what his platform is but i have seen him speak a couple times and i do not know he just impresses me more than al gore 

Recording: (4589/ 9621)

Recording: (4590/ 9621) 
well it was rough 

Recording: (4591/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4592/ 9621) 
that is probably what i will do ignore it till like august or july and then start paying attention 

Recording: (4593/ 9621) 
i mean there is always been the nerds and um i do not know when i was growing up in the seventies there really was not punk or anything like that and i think um unfortunately i mean there is always going to be all different kinds of people to make the world but it they just pushed you to an extreme certain kinds of kids and you know they want a i saw you know i watch all these shows dateline and twenty twenty and all this informative shows and how one was in texas run over one of the punk kids was run over by a um a jock 

Recording: (4594/ 9621) 
and decided to pursue the matter to the extent of marriage so that is where they met <LAUGH> no uh-huh i i come down here two or three times like you know just trips through going to the airport and other miscellaneous things but um when i moved to the city i mean it it was a real big change because i have you know used to living in the country and i move into smack dab in the middle of a downtown area 

Recording: (4595/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4596/ 9621) 
well i am saying but the 

Recording: (4597/ 9621) 
it is that is weird <LAUGH> 

Recording: (4598/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (4599/ 9621) 
well i mean to me the whole thing is wrong regardless of if you are guilty or innocent there to me there is worse things i would think than than dying you know you like i know in israel the guy who killed yitzhak rabin he got locked up and he is not allowed to see uh because uh um under jewish law you can not kill 

Recording: (4600/ 9621) 
and i have a wife been married thirteen years have two kids age five and seven both of them ones in second grade and the other ones still in daycare at ohio state university 

Recording: (4601/ 9621) 
right and if he if he is open minded enough to do it eventually he will see the light and say boy this would make it a lot easier but there are people who are like i will not do this you know so those the ones that hafta be drug screaming and kicking 

Recording: (4602/ 9621) 
it is salt water fish 

Recording: (4603/ 9621) 
um i mean at that point i uh i certainly did not have any uh real knowledge ABOUT ANY of that sort of thing um you know they covered the basics um they did talk about condoms and um contraception i remember we watched a film which everyone was very embarrassed by um i mean i do not really uh they uh they did send home a packet to the parents because i remember being really upset and not wanting my mom TO TALK WITH ME ABOUT IT 

Recording: (4604/ 9621) 
yeah procreation part of what marriage is all about but i see marriage as more than just propagating 

Recording: (4605/ 9621) 
uh she ran a forklift INTO a INTO A POLE <LAUGH> and BROK busted her nose and chipped her tooth <LAUGH> she is just a dangerous woman <LAUGH> and um so uh she gets a lot of tickets sometimes when SHES NOT getting hurt YEAH when she is not running into poles AND stuff um and you know we will use them because they do not they normally go to the movie store and just get a movie and bring it home we do that a lot too but 

Recording: (4606/ 9621) 
yeah the same thing you were talking about and uh we are only the third people to live in it and so it needed everything you know and it had gold now gold is back but in those days everything was like gold and you know and green it was horrible and uh it was great fun we had we had lot fun we we took the back porch and made it part of the kitchen and had another back porch put on uh finished the third floor and added a family room and another bedroom we put an in ground pool and so i always joke because what i paid for it i now owe three times that amount on it 

Recording: (4607/ 9621) 
and the stern expression or the expression on that face can be equally effective as the smack oh on the bottom oh with the bare hand or a switch or whatever it may be i know that my the most effective penalty for me was my mother uh would uh go out near a tree and she would break a twig uh off and she would smack me across the shoulder and yeah it left marks but it and sure it hurt i mean it would sting and i understood exactly what was meant and i think i grew up and i have ended up being i think a quite successful person i think my mother had uh uh thirteen of the fifteen children who lived uh all pretty doggone decent kids and none of us were injured none of us were hurt uh and that was a basic method of penalty it was not something that truly injured uh now today however uh i suspect my mom could easily be could have been charged with abuse in fact child abuse because it left a mark across my shoulder where that uh green it is always a green switch because uh uh the eh old ones they would break you did not want them break BREAK <LAUGH> 

Recording: (4608/ 9621)

hm 

Recording: (4708/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (4709/ 9621) 
and come back in 

Recording: (4710/ 9621) 
uh a little bit north of north broadway right along the freeway there um did not useta be a bad neighborhood but now it is just kind of you got the little kids growing up and doing shit that you know <LAUGH> <LAUGH> you picture yourself doing as a child one way or another <LAUGH> you know now you throw rocks around and stuff and accidentally break a window run away <LAUGH> 

Recording: (4711/ 9621) 
that is true sometimes we have trouble finding enough violists or something you know an instrument like that um but they they usually get enough to play a concert sometimes we have to bring in a couple of instrumentalists for the last few rehearsals um-hum so we sort of have stringers i guess you would CALL THEM <LAUGH> yeah we have actually been on w o s u also uh radio on music um our recording last year yeah of beethoven is ninth got on music in midohio <LAUGH> yeah we used the otterbein college choir um 

Recording: (4712/ 9621) 
well i would i would sit down and talk to her like you know if you want to have sex if you really want to have sex you should get on some kind of birth control 

Recording: (4713/ 9621) 
yeah well like i i played music and stuff with a lot of my friends i do not know basically just like standard teenage stuff sitting around watching tv and like i do not know just running around or whatever but like um yeah high school was always just real like like you know you put in like a tiny little bit of effort and you get like a b and that is a that is good enough i guess 

Recording: (4714/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4715/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4716/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (4717/ 9621) 
sophomore year again and ended up getting married after i finished my master is 

Recording: (4718/ 9621) 
no yeah BECAUSE IT CHANGES <LAUGH> 

Recording: (4719/ 9621) 
during school but at the same time i mean as long as the PARENTS love the kids it does not really matter what sex they are and they treat them well um so i mean that is kind of a tough question to answer i mean it is almost it is something that they almost need to ask the kids but obviously at the age that they would be adopting um they obviously would not know how to answer that question yeah 

Recording: (4720/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4721/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4722/ 9621) 
but how she got there she started out somewhere 

Recording: (4723/ 9621) 
yeah yeah yeah she probably got um i do not know maybe even she sold drugs or you know whatever kind of way she made her money but it would not have been enough welfare wise to get a car and to 

Recording: (4724/ 9621) 
but it is mindboggling that it is because i came from a small community there were only two hundred people in my senior class and you knew everybody and now you are talking two whole high schools two football teams you know it is just mindboggling all these people you know you graduate with you know know of hand full of people and do not know anybody else it is like you know a lot more of a tight knit group as a child so we had three elementary schools and one high school and that was it 

Recording: (4725/ 9621) 
because conceivably they wanted uh what was it a two dollar raise or something but and then they also get free tuition but only as i understand it only a very small percentage get that free tuition or like 

Recording: (4726/ 9621) 
well but see i think if you really try to tell kids and especially women that you know you should not sex is something that should be between two people that love each other and unless you really feel love and really think it is love then you know you should not do it 

Recording: (4727/ 9621) 
right right well let me ask you ah about somebody else who is not that well known do you know john gorka have you heard of him he is really worth looking into he is he is funny he has good songs he is a folk singer really uh along the lines of uh maybe arlo guthry or somebody i mean he he does electric stuff sometimes but he also does acoustic and um he writes most of his own songs yeah and if you ever see something by him you should get it or if you see it in a friend is collection ask to listen to it he has funny funny some of the songs are really funny and some of them are the saddest things you have ever heard yeah YEAH <LAUGH> just just tragic things <LAUGH> um uh let us see funny ones are examples of funny ones are winter cows <LAUGH> um let us see oh i can not think of too much of them right now but uh yeah 

Recording: (4728/ 9621) 
but just that freedom you know to do what you want to get some sleep to eat to take care of yourself to do a little investigation on your own to pray about it what not and then it is really clear but if you do not get that and you are always thrust back into it i do not think you can break free 

Recording: (4729/ 9621) 
i think 

Recording: (4730/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4731/ 9621) 
they have just gotten a lot worse like um my niece they my sister had moved in with me for a little bit when her and husband was having problems and my niece is uh eight well she was in fifth grade in there is a elementary school that we went to when we were kids and she just said they were cursing smoking cigarettes and everything and i just am like oh my gosh 

Recording: (4732/ 9621) 
all of creation into religion all of what spirituality is into one word religion you you can not um but when you say it is a of spiritual nature that is you know that is still leaving the door wide open that it is it is broad it is bigger than you or me ah but that ah that whole thing is um you know the people of the land had a a specific instructions on how to do things and i i am not saying they were perfect either there were a lot of indian people and there are a lot of indian people out there that are crooked as a dog is hind leg that is just the way it is they are corrupt the money has corrupt them the lack of money has corrupted them power has corrupted them um they wanna be a spiritual leader why i do not know um to me it is an ego thing and uh this rainbow eagle guy had some kind of buffalo uh um what do you call it a buffalo ceremony but he charged everybody native people do not do that i mean traditional native people you you do not charge people that wanna come learn about god there is some people in california that say certain ceremonies were a native thing and they buried a woman in the ground with a straw told her it was some ritual of proving and over coming fear yet the lady was an asthmatic and she was claustrophobic and lost the straw in her mouth and she could not breath and breathed in all the sand and died and so the first thing they put in the paper is that another native ceremony shows us how native american spirituality should be outlawed and if you look at any kind of uh spirituality religion that is out there native americans are only ones that have legislation actually saying what you can and can not have that there is blood quantums saying that if you have a fourth or a half 

Recording: (4733/ 9621) 
yeah the local ones more than anything uh 

Recording: (4734/ 9621) 
aw 

Recording: (4735/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (4736/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4737/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4738/ 9621) 
um-hum um-hum 

Recording: (4739/ 9621) 
by time you get there you are all lagged out and 

Recording: (4740/ 9621) 
kind of i have seen a few of like infomercials on stuff like that um but i can not say anything too serious has come up from it 

Recording: (4741/ 9621) 
but you are working now janet 

Recording: (4742/ 9621)

Recording: (4743/ 9621) 
i am not real up on this i know that um he he is done some things and i 

Recording: (4744/ 9621) 
that 

Recording: (4745/ 9621) 
but he just did not have a very high opinion of the army 

Recording: (4746/ 9621) 
everybody is 

Recording: (4747/ 9621) 
so um it seems the picture is kind of hard to deal with people that are in to capitalism have a pretty good lives and they have what they want and they do not uh seem> seem to have such serious problems so people who try to go against that current can get it theirselves into big trouble so and capitalism has made the united states go i mean it has worked uh and we are ahead of the world there is no question about that and what the individual people persons have and how their lives go much better on the other hand um you know i am i am actually what i would like uh if it would just spread all over the world true communism 

Recording: (4748/ 9621) 
of the people of this land that there is in a a ceremony called an eneepee which is a sweat lodge and a lot of people will talk about sweat lodge um it involves heating up stones in a fire and uh putting the stones in the lodge and pouring water over them and closing the door and singing songs it is not a sauna it is not a uh steam room

he had a variety uh eighth grade is when he was probably in some ways his better year uh he was taking a had taken computer class for grading period and um it was not going well they were teaching keyboarding well he learned that when he was in third grade so we were talking to the teacher about it says well he is disruptive he is supposed be doing keyboarding exercises and he is writing programs so anyways and he said i knew the first day he was in here he knew every thing that i was gonna teach this grading period well that kind of flew up a red flag to me and <LAUGH> can you give him other assignments oh no he is got do what everybody else is doing so we went to the principal and i was president of the uh parent is advisory committee at the time so i had an easy access to the principal he took him out of the class immediately and put him in the library and the librarian worked with him one on one teaching data base and spreadsheet uh applications to him but then but he had another teacher in the ninth grade who contacted us his english teacher and she said told us uh said he knows everything i wanna teach so i want your permission to give him a separate curriculum and she did she but he was using reading books like invisible man my ellimen ellison ralph ellison and ellimen guess it is anyway um and writing papers on it he was reading like three books by an author and then trying to write a short story in that author is style and she still tested him with the other kids just make sure she had not missed any he had not missed anything and she was he was using her grad school notes to write papers and stuff like this and uh it was he loved it and that is what he needed though when he got to high school and we would talk to teachers about they said no they could not do that uh it was very frustrated frustrating

Recording: (4757/ 9621) 
yeah it is great you know and they like it they sing a song they you know interact with other kids and learn to use the library you know nowadays you know people do not go to the library as much either on they you get your information off the internet or you buy a books or you know yeah you know so i just we have felt that if we introduce them now that hopefully this will lead on to later in with this way you can monitor their television we let them rent a couple movies here and there but we see what they rent or you know take out compared to you know the cartoon network and all these crazy it is just cartoons just seem so worthless nowadays but actually you watch some of the older cartoons that we watched and they seem more violent than some of the new ones you know daffy duck and the road runner and these type of things all it was was kill the fox you know they have that a so we are just like wow wait well i do not know if we wanna want let them watch that either so yeah they and disney and disneys pretty strong i mean you know you think of disney and you think of kids but you still a lot of the stuff they put out is pretty hardcore for a five year old or so i mean you know a lot of the dinosaurs and all kinds of stuff it is it is of violent nature but you gotta if you balance it i think you will be all right oh yeah absolutely yeah it is tough sometimes <LAUGH> YEAH to read the paper at the SAME TIME yeah yeah like this five year old is addicted to the tarzan he likes tarzan movie that was out so yeah he wants to <LAUGH> we have kind of boycotted him <LAUGH> the daughter WANTS to throw it away <LAUGH> never do not have to watch that again

Recording: (4759/ 9621) 
they are just not getting it right 

Recording: (4760/ 9621) 
uh i plan at this point to pursue history to the p h d level ah anything of course can happen 

Recording: (4761/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (4762/ 9621) 
well i know but you know it it struck me as funny at the time because thats the way it was worded <LAUGH> 

Recording: (4763/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (4764/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah well it was like i kind of just like stopped going to class and and like and then i just like ended up withdrawing because i would have like failed everything anyways but um yeah then i was living with my friend for awhile um but and then like now me and her and my other friend live in down on maynard 

Recording: (4765/ 9621) 
it is like right 

Recording: (4766/ 9621) 
you have to go to dances you have to do that whole thing so i really do not know how to how how they would go about doing that perhaps like i know we used to have like uh we had like the administrators actually allowed us to have ah a day where everyone like the whole class as a class could go have a picnic like in the practice football field and that was cool because everyone got along those days because you did not have to go to class you know you spent the second half the day just hanging out and so everyone got along that way and i think that would be a start you know but then that hurts the the the administrators in a sense that they are there to provide an education so it would be rough in like my high school they they put up cameras andtheyhadlike they locked bathrooms like at certain times you could not go in them and like it was getting and they had like we were on the front page the akron beacon journal because they had a lock down where no one was allowed to leave their classroom and then they brought this the dogs through and they found i was surprised they found a lot of drugs 

Recording: (4767/ 9621) 
they are unknown from doing much yeah yeah i yeah i just do not think that they can do much and i i am sure it is very frustrating for them well and i know it is we got friend who is was a teacher she just retired a couple years ago she is about our age and uh it is it is very different now uh you know it is she said it is scary going into the classroom sometimes uh and before it was not that you knew that if you had a problem you could make a unknown know go and get something dealt with it now you can not get backing on it 

Recording: (4768/ 9621) 
so he would not have to pay for it 

Recording: (4769/ 9621) 
oh yeah <LAUGH> 

Recording: (4770/ 9621) 
um-hum

yeah and and never got any better then they got in marching band and they were in that for four years and sometimes we notice they marched and sometimes they did not because they did not learn their music but they stayed with it and they said then they like volunteered down at cosi they did not get paid a dime for this but they did it because they enjoyed helping and definite so like they go we want that student over there said you as a straight a student have proved nothing to us and you over there as a b student have proved that by gosh you know you will try out for something and if you do not do well you go but i like doing it and i am gonna keep with it you know and to me the straight a student who does nothing is like the kids who go to school and shoot people they have nothing in their life at all and the other one has you know activities and they are giving of themselves to the community you know you know like my both my daughters have like volunteered for the library reading program and then they went on and they volunteer at cosi and and my oldest one was in key club and they would have like easter egg hunts for the school is a grade school and it is attached to columbus alternative high school so um you know i i read an um uh a uh resume that she put in for a scholarship and it was explaining how the the closest she got to crying at school was when she would uh do these projects because she says there were kids there that she knew had no easter candy and it was just they were just so excited that the kids went out and bought like a dollar or twos worth of candy and hid it out and they would have an easter egg hunt for them at school and she says you know those and things that were important to her and you know to me that makes you feel like you are worth something but the kids that go you know the ones who went to school i you know i do not see any community service or i do not know about i i am not a big gung ho have to be religious person i mean i i feel i am a christian but i am not a church goer and i do not think you hafta go there to be a religious person you know but uh you know i think religion and community service and feeling like you have given something to the community and you know you are just not asking continuously for it you know and and trying things and failing at them and going okay well but i still like to play basketball i am terrible but i like to play and i can not make the team so what do i do i know i will go to the y and play there you know that that is what keeps kids out of trouble and those that go to school and come home and either sit on the computer and you know what do the chat room stuff or the e mail stuff or sit on the playing with video games i think those the ones that are the big problem children because they you know mom and dad go how can i get them to do something and stay out of my hair oh i know i will buy them a nintendo i will buy them this sega i will buy this look they are out of my way you know because you know

i do that every once in a while just like when i get bored 

Recording: (4784/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (4785/ 9621) 
just because uh um women have a medicine you know and probably because that was lacking in my life um i could not focus on what i needed to focus on when i heard a woman is voice in there but then some of the elders sat me down and and the other thing about the sweat lodge is men go in there in shorts women go in there in a long cotton dress you will hear people say you go in there naked

Recording: (4793/ 9621)

i forget they have the like way more than like they dwarf any other state i think so that to me is not that is not admirable and then i so the that is one reason i would not vote for bush 

Recording: (4800/ 9621) 
right so a lot of them already believe and that they have their own religion and they they are really faithful so that was the one of the main problems is that they um they had been so holding on to that for so long and it is so strong they do not wanna let go of what and then the men their problem was usually that they would drink a lot and 

Recording: (4801/ 9621)

amazing how much the growth in delaware and different areas when i was growing up here and how marysville and it was such a farm town um just the growth of the different cities and suburbs of columbus is amazing and the housing and 

Recording: (4844/ 9621) 
yeah i do not know why uh columbus was just stubborn about it until the last year uh they had not able to get subs fifty substitutes fifty percent of the time and so the teachers were screaming and they were splitting the kids up and putting them in other classrooms well i do not know if the parents made anything about it but i guess finally you know when you have fifty percent of your classrooms uncovered uh they came to it and it got so used to be nobody appreciated a substitute nobody the kids the principal or the other teachers but now it is like oh thank you for coming oh thank you for coming so i said maybe that worked a little bit but now just in the last two weeks i think a lot of the retired teachers who were not messing around with it have come back in so i do not know exactly what to yeah <LAUGH> 

Recording: (4845/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4846/ 9621)

Recording: (4854/ 9621) 
a lot of exciting stuff going on now at the libraries it is not not the old you know old lady in the bun yeah yeah and the web has really changed that

Recording: (4868/ 9621) 
so family um familiarity and um just the community i think crime i think it is going up and up um traffic is HORRENDOUS but the one but i mean you need to go through that right now because columbus is expanding so much that we need the orange brailles and um i guess the lack of publicity nationally i i we do not have you know like the national football teams and now with the hockey coming i i think were getting more recognition but when people talk about columbus they then i do not think they know columbus ohio or columbus georgia or columbus where right 

Recording: (4869/ 9621) 
not doing anything my son uh you know with his disorder he would constantly be uh late for school and i uh called the school and told them this was in high school

Recording: (4877/ 9621) 
i know 

Recording: (4878/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4879/ 9621) 
some of the really hard questions um why do bad things happen to good people people can not people can not just accept that that bad things happen to good people they want to know why i do not know why i am not i i mean yeah i have a personal relationship with my with my god but we are not on you know we are not on a conversational i am on this side of the table you are on that side the table why did this happen and he does not he does not see fit to tell me why something happens unless it pertains to me um let us see what is another really hard one um one of the biggest ones with people my age is the is um apologetics uh apologetics which is going out and saying you are a sinner accept christ everybody on this campus has heard of brother jedd he runs around on he runs around on the oval going you know slut whore yadda yadda yadda and that is just i mean there are a lot of there are a lot of people within the community of of christians who can not stand that we do not like what he is doing because yeah i am one of them because we have to go back anyone who has been influenced by him we have to go back and we have to undo all the damage he is done before we can really start in on them and and and helping them to understand what we are trying to tell them we have to undo what brother jedd has done because he is just i mean yeah maybe his heart is in the right place but he is doing it the wrong way but um one of the big things is right after you are done doing all of the spiel about you know why you think they should accept christ in their life they say okay that is good for you and that is the general that is the general feeling among people our age our generation i mean i mean what generation are we anyways i am i am i am twenty so there is like the generation x they are the generation right after me and there is generation y two k they are generation right before me so we are stuck right in the middle do not even think we have a generation

Recording: (4885/ 9621)

Recording: (4891/ 9621) 
uh well the problem is is um like say every airline wants to go to new york city and they want all their business men there at eight a m well an airport has so many runways and so many taxi ways and you know like say ten airplanes every ten minutes can come in and out of those airports well they end up shooting like thirty there so instead of letting them all get in the air and staying up there and hold while they are uh you know shooting them in what they do is they uh like uh say going to ohare they will you hafta call for release times at these different airports and they will say well uh he can not go right now but he can go like at twenty seven past the hour so he they know by looking at the entire picture and how many airplanes are coming to that airport when he will fit in so it is not so much air traffic delays it is airlines that cause it themself it is like uh you know like you and i and five hundred people want to get to this room at ten oclock today well rather than say why do not some of you come at ten and another group come at ten fifteen another group and we are all trying to do the same thing at once and it does not work you know you you can not get you can only get so many people through that door and if you say well i am gonna take five at a time well they can get in but if you say i am taking five hundred at time it does not work and so the airlines always go well it is the government and regulations and blah blah blah that is why we are delayed and it is really them themselves because they are 

Recording: (4892/ 9621)

Recording: (4902/ 9621) 
year 

Recording: (4903/ 9621) 
i do not really go over to the east side very very often you know sometimes we would go over you know in highschool and drive and see if we could see a prostitute you know or something like that but um i do not i do not know as far as i do not really keep up with statistics as far as the crime rate and those types of things i mean i do not know if it is the media UH THATS you know portrays as there is more than there used to be um i know that when i was younger i was allowed to to do a lot more things uh by myself like to to go places on the bus and and those types of things and than my family is allowed to do now

Recording: (4909/ 9621) 
that is that is what i would i would think in that case i i mean because the dominant culture it i mean is always gonna be accessible to them 

Recording: (4910/ 9621) 
yeah but if you are the first state in the union to do it it it will cost you millions and millions it would be rough it be so hard to 

Recording: (4911/ 9621)

Recording: (4912/ 9621) 
for everybody so you have you want to go to ivy league you do not even want to look here

Recording: (4970/ 9621) 
it is just challenge to figure out how to make something work or how to i i am just incredibly optimistic i mean i really feel like um whatever happens to me i really it is it is my responsibility to you know help it happen take care of it deal with it you know i am but i always have a backup plan 

Recording: (4971/ 9621)

Recording: (4980/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4981/ 9621)

Recording: (4982/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4983/ 9621) 
so there is there is no faulting i mean these folks but still there is nothing else do and there is nothing creative in response to say to this experience so you end up with you are kidding again and again and again and you had two individuals who said you are kidding and then immediately following it never mind pretend i never that that <LAUGH> 

Recording: (4984/ 9621) 
sure 

Recording: (4985/ 9621)

Recording: (4991/ 9621)

Recording: (4992/ 9621) 
that is cool 

Recording: (4993/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (4994/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (4995/ 9621) 
well like management here 

Recording: (4996/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (4997/ 9621) 
hmm how would you end up in ohio 

Recording: (4998/ 9621) 
the food service and she knows that they are really bad and that is really sad but they are not doing anything about it 

Recording: (4999/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (5000/ 9621) 
right right well it is sort of a problem as well the you know does i mean uh it is seems you know from what i have read it if you wanted to make a bomb it is fairly uncomplicated you know so that is 

Recording: (5001/ 9621) 
that is right in other words there is so much me anymore instead of us and we 

Recording: (5002/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5003/ 9621) 
yeah it does it is not like a skilled profession to me i think 

Recording: (5004/ 9621) 
well see that is because i do not think americans travel as much as as like the the europeans do i think i guess because europeans they have like more i guess public transportation accessible they got the trains that the eurotrains and the buses and and and and just like the by just by personal car you can go you know across just go across the border you can then go and visit uh you know countries like like it is so condensed but here it is like we have got our oceans and it is like we gotta like fly so so i i think that is why like i think the europeans are more are much more cooler in that respect rather than much more cosmopolitan just because it they they they it is like it is no big deal for for like somebody in europe to speak like seven languages where here it is like you know you get somebody over here who who can actually who actually knows english <LAUGH> you know it is like so that that is i think that is i think that is what i will find hopefully hopefully 

Recording: (5005/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5006/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5007/ 9621) 
yeah i think it is further east than where i was i was right in the ural mountains so it is like the border of europe and asia 

Recording: (5008/ 9621) 
so they are close but i try to avoid seeing them except my grandfather who is a a nice charitable human being the others are all nice and sweet and stuff but do not have enough rewarding characteristics to make me want to spend lots of time around them 

Recording: (5009/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> it is and it was world war two that brought them TOGETHER <LAUGH> um my my dad was uh in the at the end of the war he was in the army air corps he never had to go over seas that he was stationed and louisiana 

Recording: (5010/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5011/ 9621) 
not so much old star trek uh i like deep space nine of the new ones um i mean back when it was new i liked the next generation but once deep space nine came out and it had a grittier darker story that was not so cookie cutter in fashion there was uh a greater degree of continuity from episode to episode and more character development it was not like these perfect people on this ship going and facing bad the the characters themselves had flaws and that caused for better drama so i like that do not like voyager so much i i see that it when it first came out i had high hopes because i saw it as something that would be even grittier they had the the potential for for excellent intercharacter conflict but they glossed over all those immediately within the first season um and that really bothered me and then it ultimately the story is like they are trapped but they do not really pursue like the issues of being separated from home in two factions that had 

Recording: (5012/ 9621) 
they settled in springfield ohio and then my mom met my father um he was from pataskala they met here at o s u where they are going to college and they settled here in columbus 

Recording: (5013/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5014/ 9621) 
you know she says something about uh you sure you are not a football player or something you know you got that that <LAUGH> that significant signature there going and 

Recording: (5015/ 9621) 
and i would definitely keep a eye out and you know figure out what is going on you know 

Recording: (5016/ 9621) 
like you hang out like i do not know it is more of like a like a suburban town as opposed to like a centralized downtown yeah it is just like you know like a half an hour or uh or i mean in twenty minutes outside you know you can get to dublin or fifteen minutes to dublin or something like that you know i mean that is still like a part of of columbus as opposed to yeah 

Recording: (5017/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5018/ 9621) 
yeah they have uh well okay they do have sales tax but it is added in to the price before so you are not just sitting there trying to figure out what it is 

Recording: (5019/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (5020/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5021/ 9621) 
right and you know while the baby is in the hospital be covered under my son is insurance and she is covered under her father is insurance so their medical expenses are not gonna be very big 

Recording: (5022/ 9621) 
yeah you go to you go to class in one building and you go across the yard to another then you go to lunch and then you come across another and your locker and all that stuff it is just like a mini campus 

Recording: (5023/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5024/ 9621) 
so i do not know she likes it 

Recording: (5025/ 9621) 
yeah man i do not want to be over in the next county you know driving in the middle of the sky yeah a couple people down there floating around under me 

Recording: (5026/ 9621) 
and it is a very it seems to be a fairly conservative uh university as well so 

Recording: (5027/ 9621) 
i mean not that i i do not want to be on welfare it is like it is like a a down when i want to go up you know 

Recording: (5028/ 9621) 
uh as well actually when i was at ohio state i worked for the newspaper 

Recording: (5029/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> how would you do this to ME <LAUGH> 

Recording: (5030/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5031/ 9621) 
but that is because i am not home a lot and like i said my wife is here now her mom is just moved to texas so she is living down in texas and she is got brothers and sisters all over the united states 

Recording: (5032/ 9621) 
um it is probably would be worse i mean actually just wait for my last experiments i heard couple people talking about it they were talking about it 

Recording: (5033/ 9621) 
not at this job no 

Recording: (5034/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5035/ 9621) 
right they and that is it they had not had a challenge you need to have challenges put to you everyday everyday you have more meaningfulness in life so that when you put your head down at night you are saying oh i am thankful for what i did <LAUGH> gosh darn it i am still coming to you i need more help tomorrow because <LAUGH> without something intangible there is gonna be a motivation factor someone is gotta give you a drill and to get up tomorrow morning and say hey i am gonna do a better job today than i did yesterday but when we as a society say oh gee he is struggled yesterday well let us lower this thing bar let us lower the bar a little more let us lower you know gosh darn it hey scooney you did not make that last shot last night hey hey time out let us give scooney two more minutes to make let us let him have another shoot he gets two more minutes to try to get it 

Recording: (5036/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5037/ 9621) 
i do not know uh in i do not uh for a while we got it stopped the thing that is uh confusing to me is that sometimes we will get something stopped for twenty five or thirty years or ten or fifteen and then we go back it is like hey we got moved ourselves out of that why are we going back to it now um and and i think you know the papers keep saying that our uh crime rate is going down and everything and so uh i think that is because we some people are you know trying to make it deal with these people as people the who are ill or are sick and try to help them with their you you know it took us a long time to figure out that alcoholism is a disease okay and uh so now we try to help alcoholics well well certainly MURDERING IS A <LAUGH> 

Recording: (5038/ 9621) 
no this all started long before that actually just recently he seems to have accepted the idea that yes the baby is gonna be born i i think he just kind of tried to ignore it for a long time but <LAUGH> it is all very obvious now um and she is she is great

Recording: (5097/ 9621) 
right if she could have become the candidate she might have been able to beat i i think almost anybody can beat gore right now but you know and in in election times a weekend is a couple of centuries uh uh a year is an eon <lauhyknow> so anything can happen between now and then but i think uh dole had a good chance of being elected because most americans are moderate and will go with the moderate candidate uh which is basically where clinton placed himself in the two elections he ran in um most real democrats the warren beatty is of the world and many you know congressmen and and senators dislike clinton because they they did not think he was democratic enough um i liked clinton because as i said over the years uh i have learned that extremes in either party do not get elected and that if you want someone that has your general interest at heart you hafta find someone who is a moderate and can can appeal to everybody i used to tell school districts when i went in to tell them how to to put together a school levy campaign that basically you had the rule of thirties and that had nothing to do with my age but that there was about thirty percent of the people who were were for you with the yes votes thirty percent who were automatically against you the no votes and thirty percent in between i told them ignore the no votes you know just just do not get them upset with you you do not want them you know working actively against you lock up your thirty that are with you make sure you you know you do something with them but this group the the middle thirties i call them you had to massage them and that is what clinton did so well and that is what dole could have done i am not sure if george w is gonna be able to uh because to get the the nomination eventually he is gonna come out and have to make his hard statements to those people which is i am anti abortion i am pro gun he is already said the pro gun and that is because it is going against what most americans are saying dole i think represented where most americans are if you look at opinion polls um so you know you hafta find a way to to moderate that stance uh whether you are republican or a democrat 

Recording: (5098/ 9621) 
yeah if i had um if i had stayed for the i i did not graduate so if i would stayed for the fourth year um when we did a lot would do a lot of um uh uh making up a portfolio that kind of thing um i probably then i would have started going to interviews and i i would have i probably would have stayed but it was

Recording: (5107/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (5108/ 9621) 
uh like i know one of the poisons used in it is like rat poison or something like that i mean just obviously the idea of putting rat poison into you when it is meant to kill a rat obviously seems pretty dangerous

um-hum 

Recording: (5118/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah 

Recording: (5119/ 9621) 
yeah think the population um in a way but i think it also leaves it open for all the things of having too many people in one area um i do not i do not know i think the main thing that affects me now and since i have been home i have been reading the paper a lot more and you know i am more aware of what is going on and i really um gonna be some kind of activist for <LAUGH> um i do not know a lot of the places that are coming up the gentleman is clubs and things like that i just i think that is gonna be really bad for the kids and and everybody around um there is one off of uh bethel or no it is off of henderson cahoots and then there is the red hot peppers or something i saw the other day and i could not even believe they are like right across the street from each other you know and it is funny because you read the paper and and it seems like so many people are concerned about kids and education and all that but then they let all that stuff so thinking it really affects it yeah try to go around <LAUGH> YEAH and until they make a women is uh club SO will not be real EQUAL <LAUGH> YEAH <LAUGH> 

Recording: (5120/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (5121/ 9621) 
but they are uh because they are both government programs but yeah but i think like i said for the for the younger people because it is because it is not their fault their parents can not get health health care so <LAUGH>

so you have how many kids 

Recording: (5124/ 9621) 
uh we have been very happy with the o s u daycare i do not know if you have any association with but oh it is it is just unbelievable our daughter went there her from six weeks all the way up to when she went to first grade and uh i mean when she got out of that daycare she could read she could write she could do computer you know you know it is an education it is not you know people you pay for it is one of your highers but you know higher amount of money for 

Recording: (5125/ 9621) 
once you are in it you are been in it and that is it i have thirty two points

yeah it is uh well you are right 

Recording: (5127/ 9621) 
that is all right okay 

Recording: (5128/ 9621) 
it felt innocent to me and i liked that um because all the other times where they started to kiss it is always been like stereotypical romantic da da da da da and that is like wow two friends alone it is new years perfect you know it was not it was not like they were gonna jump in the sack or anything like that 

Recording: (5129/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> YEAH REALLY i do not know i mean i guess for me i i just i just think jason and i get along so well you know and and we have been together for about two years and i mean i i do not know i just i do i just i just really like him i do not KNOW IF ILL FEEL THAT WAY IN in ten years from now but it certainly there is a lot of things that that our families are very similar i mean we have a lot of the same types of opinions about about different things and and we communicate very well and i think those are a lot of things you have to look at from the beginning i know that i was in a relationship for about five years before i met him and um his name was jason too but he he drank a lot 

Recording: (5130/ 9621) 
that is true home 

Recording: (5131/ 9621) 
oh really THATS cute <LAUGH> 

Recording: (5132/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5133/ 9621) 
i got a lot of respect for the college kids majority of them it is it is other people i do not have RESPECT for 

Recording: (5134/ 9621) 
huh 

Recording: (5135/ 9621) 
and oh she is snapping she is pregnant back off you know it is like 

Recording: (5136/ 9621) 
oh no and it turns out it was the the uh the faceless aliens set a trap for the for the guys and i did not like the way it was resolved but i like the fact that it was not resolved the way that they set it up so i think that i mean we supposedly know about samantha 

Recording: (5137/ 9621) 
it is and it is not because i i see where he is and he is really messed up and i i can not do anything for him but i have you know i have i am open to a relationship with him 

Recording: (5138/ 9621)

<LAUGH> you walk in and i am like you are like oh my gosh <LAUGH> so it is oh you know the fire on that huh 

Recording: (5141/ 9621) 
oh okay well the reason i asked was a lot it seems to me a lot of the impetus for going to church or going back to church for people is when their kid gets old enough to go to sunday school <LAUGH> starting asking questions about religion and you are saying well i suppose i could answer all of these but <LAUGH> yeah 

Recording: (5142/ 9621) 
ah 

Recording: (5143/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5144/ 9621) 
well and i think it really it still goes back to the mom and the dad and and what the kid thinks would make their mom and dad happy you know would i act this way would that make my mom and because until you are about five or four your parents are pretty important to you and what they think so that is when you know you have to instill that stuff you have to you know oh and they learn by watching you do it too uh i mean my son now oh i saw him when let us see he was fifteen maybe he would run across the street when martha the eighty six year old lady across was trying to bring her garbage down he would seen me do that go oh let me get that for you martha she is got arthritis she looks like she is gonna fall she takes steps about this big and i have seen him do that

Recording: (5147/ 9621) 
uh before we used to have a system that only people in the back room of the libraries connected to and it was all mainframe and then people got p c is on their desk and suddenly the whole world of who could access any system and what they could do on their desk changed uh and now we have gone more out in the public work in the public scene do it is not just for the people in the back room uh and then the web you know people anybody anywhere can connect we only worked with libraries before now we are trying to figure out how do we deal with anybody who just can wants to connect to us 

Recording: (5148/ 9621) 
i do not know i mean i was actually looking at that riser military and then they started popping up all this abuse stuff and i was like man darn <LAUGH> it is like my aunt

Recording: (5179/ 9621) 
well we believe that um that revelation that was there on earth was actually restored again and through joseph smith because he had a desire in his heart to know what was true and he prayed and he actually had a vision where he saw god and jesus christ and i know this is all really i mean this is like deep doctrine stuff but and um and he was told that there were none of the churches on the earth were true that some of them had good things but they their um they were not exactly hitting the mark 

Recording: (5180/ 9621)

Recording: (5193/ 9621) 
i i well that is a that is a tough one uh i remember when you know when we were we had you know some movies like that but they were like the bowery boys and stuff you know or it was you pretty much knew it was all fake anyway you know but and to me that is fake and uh uh and i never really thought about when was growing up that it was what was real and everything uh i always knew that by i there again know by my dad being a hunter and everything you know i knew that when you shot something that it died it was not a it was not a game you know uh and i would hate to think that that would cause some kid to go off his rocker and shoot somebody out shoot another human being i mean that does not i do not even know why there should be any concern for it guess is what i am saying 

Recording: (5194/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5195/ 9621) 
well i do not think that women should be on the front lines uh some women are are physically able to do what is needed some definitely are not of course there is a same by the same token some men are not but uh as as support groups i think that is all right 

Recording: (5196/ 9621)

Recording: (5197/ 9621) 
she is very bright she is very she comes from an extremely dysfunctional family her um parents divorced when she was about four her mother is an alcoholic her father said that he would take her with him and then after they got divorced he changed his mind so she is pretty much raised herself it is a big it it is terrible things what she is HAD to go through and she is made it very clear that she will not live with an alcoholic and that is helped straighten him out some and our feeling was never that the alcoholism or the the drugs was not the problem and we have dealt with several counselors and that is all they wanted to deal with our has always been it is a symptom uh took the psychologist a year and a half but he finally charlie is he is very intuitive and even as a toddler he could do this he he would seemed to be able to give adults what they needed from him 

Recording: (5198/ 9621) 
it was real close to my home <LAUGH> 

Recording: (5199/ 9621)

um-hum 

Recording: (5396/ 9621)

Recording: (5398/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5399/ 9621)

Recording: (5400/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> just like <LAUGH> 

Recording: (5401/ 9621) 
about two two and a half years ago 

Recording: (5402/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (5403/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5404/ 9621) 
in a heartbeat try and help them but they do not i do not think they make an effort to like put out any you know

the majority are the ones that do not get the guidance at home that you are trying to reach ai not gonna go to boy scouts 

Recording: (5406/ 9621) 
they are they have a very nice standard of living all of them do 

Recording: (5407/ 9621) 
and so they offered to move them back 

Recording: (5408/ 9621) 
now people like that can not work when i was a kid your family took care of you there was not the welfare and stuff like this but you do not have a family structure no more 

Recording: (5409/ 9621) 
a parakeet yes little two and a half three ounce ball of fluff 

Recording: (5410/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5411/ 9621) 
once they start running those CAMPAIGNS YKNOW then i will kind of kind of read up on it but i have not not really 

Recording: (5412/ 9621) 
oh yeah and that is normal we understood that we knew we knew a lot of stuff we were gonna we raised him to be very independent and i always said that we are gonna regret this someday i said another ten years we will be pleased but uh we were not particularly raised either of us my wife or i to be very independent uh so it gets to point that when we were first married pretty it was hard to make it simple decision on anything you know we have worked through that after twenty five years but uh or to stand on our own or anything but you know we learned to do it but we always he was always very independent his teachers said independent we said it said stubborn but it is like even go to mcdonalds or something and he was did not want onions on anything he if he ordered a a happy meal without onions and they put onions on it he would go up to the counter even as six and seven years old and and tell them 

Recording: (5413/ 9621) 
because yeah 

Recording: (5414/ 9621) 
oh my gosh they just 

Recording: (5415/ 9621) 
nope i met him through a friend i met him through his brother was dating my best friend 

Recording: (5416/ 9621) 
yeah he is really good 

Recording: (5417/ 9621) 
i think it would 

Recording: (5418/ 9621) 
yes and that is what i like 

Recording: (5419/ 9621) 
YEAH <LAUGH> 

Recording: (5420/ 9621) 
hit the mark sometimes so <LAUGH> HE GETS TO CLEAN THE TOILET especially since most of that is his 

Recording: (5421/ 9621) 
anything else is a hardware failure and you have to go fix it somewhere else anyway so if you know how to put an operating system on your machine you can start over if you can start over there is no reason to be scared of anything that you do problem number one in playing with computers for most people is being afraid that they are going to break something 

Recording: (5422/ 9621) 
well i believe me i know 

Recording: (5423/ 9621) 
yeah you can hide a lot of that and get away with it for long time which you know i am sure she did i do not know i always thought um i always thought it would be neat to have a system like the police have if you do not pay a speeding ticket there is a warrant for your arrest and they come after you 

Recording: (5424/ 9621) 
like catholicism oh from mormons well our basic um real fundamental belief is that the church that the russians believed in at one time was the true church and that it was um the the same church that christ set up when he was on the earth with the twelve apostles and and but the after christ died that the authority was taken from the earth to um have those apostles and to have the the church set up like it was and it must have been really strong because it is still lasted all the same catholic and all the orthodox churches still carry all these beliefs 

Recording: (5425/ 9621) 
um no children so it was quite easy for us 

Recording: (5426/ 9621) 
yeah not not for special conditions NOTHING just universally it is wrong 

Recording: (5427/ 9621) 
oh i think it i would do it in a minute but my family does not want it they all my husband thinks we are fine he does not want anymore around and all my kids are so used to all their own 

Recording: (5428/ 9621) 
and until that consumer becomes on equal knowledge level as the uh it is always gonna be inequitable and you are gonna have a problem in our society because we do not need these large houses and so forth because as you progress in age it becomes a liability but then the developers are thinking well let us see well we can make condos downsize a little bit but still we want make this we want make this margin of profit yeah we do but what about for society is best interests 

Recording: (5429/ 9621) 
yeah that is true that is a pretty good analogy 

Recording: (5430/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5431/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5432/ 9621) 
yeah it is but see i have always i i have one floors where i live now i vacuum them i mean i am just the type you know i did not want pet hair and 

Recording: (5433/ 9621) 
but yeah i in discipline she is not she is not as as i am i do not 

Recording: (5434/ 9621) 
i do not know i do not know <LAUGH> i am sure it would happen because there is all kinds of wacky people out there <LAUGH> seriously i do not know i have the family members that are homosexual that is just my own personal thing beliefs i do not know i think that is they should not have taken it off of the d m s whatever it was <LAUGH> i do not know 

Recording: (5435/ 9621) 
yeah you have you follow the script it that that is real funny too like you know you get um they they listen to you like they monitor the calls and um you know they listen to you and then it is like this sheet like if you asked for the specials and like if you you know said it in this way and like if you used this or whatever you know and like um um oh it is just real weird 

Recording: (5436/ 9621) 
oh i know it is so much fun 

Recording: (5437/ 9621) 
aw 

Recording: (5438/ 9621) 
it is just like your people you see go to church that walk out of church see somebody sitting there that is homeless 

Recording: (5439/ 9621) 
gay people or straight people so 

Recording: (5440/ 9621) 
yeah when i first went to oberlin i was a performance major in french horn and looking back on it i wish i would maybe thought to major in music education or at least have a little bit of background in that because i am thinking it would have given me a little more dimension in terms of my my teaching possibilities and although i am certified to teach now in chemistry and uh earth science um it might be nice to have the option of teaching music also 

Recording: (5441/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5442/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> YEAH right yeah 

Recording: (5443/ 9621) 
um-hum i just got done doing some roofing and i was supposta meet my girlfriend out there she never did show up so i had to walk from where incredible universe useta be we will just say hilliard and two seventy all the way back this way on campus without water <LAUGH> oh man talk about being stuck in a desert 

Recording: (5444/ 9621) 
uh just at home i just have a tape that i use it is kathy smith one of her things that i really like 

Recording: (5445/ 9621) 
i answered it RIGHT <LAUGH> 

Recording: (5446/ 9621) 
person on she is pretty high up i guess i was unaware 

Recording: (5447/ 9621) 
but managed get that much information out so the other cop goes upstairs and chris chris is interpretation of the story at this point is one moment i am cheerfully playing on the computer and the next moment i i turn around there is a large police OFFICER IN DOORWAY of your room he said hi <LAUGH> he said i think you should come downstairs they do not tell chris anything so chris comes downstairs and he stands beside me 

Recording: (5448/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5449/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5450/ 9621) 
i do not argue with em i do not debate it it is just like it might 

Recording: (5451/ 9621) 
and being able to meet them quicker and more effectively i think so yeah oh yeah um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum i know <LAUGH> um-hum that is another thing i forgot to mention <LAUGH> um-hum exactly just from family <LAUGH> YEAH um-hum oh yeah yeah but it was something i have learned just from the other parents well mostly mothers that i you know talk to is that you know if it is not necessary to say it then it is necessary not to say it so it is just kind of a in your home type of thing and you do not really go around saying yeah we sleep in the same bed and we breast feed still and <LAUGH> you just kind of they ask and you are like yeah well yeah that is just the way we are doing it so 

Recording: (5452/ 9621) 
no this real like to live off campus you have to well after my class it will be twenty two and senior credit status but my class was twenty one or senior or senior credit so i got to move off campus but like had i been a year younger i would not have been able to because they have to wait until twenty two so they are 

Recording: (5453/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5454/ 9621) 
yeah i start early and she starts late so she gets them the one daughter on the bus to go to school and then then she can take the boy over to the daycare and then they are only there five hours or so 

Recording: (5455/ 9621) 
yeah and i am closer to the ones that that feel the same way i do about THINGS my oldest sister you know i can stay on the phone so long but we have such different opinions about things that yeah i do not stay on very long with her 

Recording: (5456/ 9621) 
and uh well she the uh the people that own it are starting to build it up now but it is been like that it was the first apartment community um in columbus it was built in thirty eight i guess 

Recording: (5457/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (5458/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (5459/ 9621) 
or some kind of tax program 

Recording: (5460/ 9621) 
no it is it is kind of like um you go to a private school and you get there maybe seven years old on up to fifteen sixteen and at sixteen they can actually determine give you a test and sit down with you and ask you about different things and sixteen fifteen sixteen year old could actually graduate from college you know be yeah they have they have showed that study already i mean i think it is i think it is amazing yeah i mean when i first heard about it i said uh some doogie howser shit you know <LAUGH> but now it is just you know now it is kind of reality you know because i know pretty much a lot of skilled skilled trades i know how to cook pretty much know how to handle myself out in the wilderness <LAUGH> mean you know go up on nature hikes and go fishing all that stuff just combines into one it is all about being an individual and if those teachers can not study with that individual know what that individual wants young then older kids not gonna know what to do end up practicing law and not liking it going to all that school for it 

Recording: (5461/ 9621) 
yes <LAUGH> but it was interesting um um they did have uh assemblies where they had religious assemblies um religion was not a all uh it was not all invasive in this school but they did have assemblies and uh for religious holidays and that kind of thing and i remember thinking uh it is it is interesting that the concept of eating somebody is flesh blood <LAUGH> it is almost cult like <LAUGH> and i am thinking and i am starting to think well what really separates a a religion from a cult <LAUGH> and now i think it is just th this social acceptance of it really almost um people you know how many people are in it probably i what number divides them i am not really SURE <LAUGH> yeah yeah yeah well i like i like um i was i have been very politically active at various times my past and um especially i guess in the late seventies and early eighties i was very active in um alternative energy fighting against nuclear power and um been active in various times in animal rights movements and uh political campaigns uh foreign policy kinds of debates that kind of kind of thing and one thing that i have noticed a lot is there are a lot of there are well there wide spectrum but in the um there a lot of liberals in the catholic church too <LAUGH> you know that 

Recording: (5462/ 9621) 
uh we were floating around just they did not know if they were gonna send us in or not because it was toward the end of it 

Recording: (5463/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5464/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (5465/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5466/ 9621) 
i am a spanish major 

Recording: (5467/ 9621) 
that is funny too how people care like people apologize too when when they are dumb or whatever and it is like like they care so much you know about somebody that they are talking to on the phone for like five minutes um i do not know it is people sometimes ask me like where where we are you know i tell them like columbus ohio and like um like i talked to some lady from from uh new jersey she was like twenty or something for for a long time she was she was real funny just uh how how accents are in philly she would say like horrible and uh saying numbers like like nine and or kind of like an east coast accent she it was real funny and she was just asking me like what it looked like in our building you know so that is always funny too you know you call people from the phone you do not know what they look like you do not know what the other person looks like and what the building is set up like it is interesting 

Recording: (5468/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5469/ 9621) 
they are liking it you know small town living out in the country raising the kids you know their big house huge yard dog you know i we keep looking and saying you know now how is this different or better for the kids so 

Recording: (5470/ 9621) 
yeah i i like uh football and pool 

Recording: (5471/ 9621) 
and these guys have a free ride and then they just leave on it 

Recording: (5472/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5473/ 9621) 
they are like three times more price wise but 

Recording: (5474/ 9621) 
makes and just keep an eye on what is going on 

Recording: (5475/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5476/ 9621) 
but the writing they give you one point for each paragraph so you hafta get five points to pass now you might get four out of five and almost pass and then you hafta retake that one part 

Recording: (5477/ 9621) 
yeah we yup you have to concentrate on what is important or it just flies by and you do not even see it yeah 

Recording: (5478/ 9621) 
and uh the other one is um a uh working cuff at the steubenville ohio uh 

Recording: (5479/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5480/ 9621) 
yeah i grew up in columbus i was born here uh went to went and here at o s u at for school as an undergrad 

Recording: (5481/ 9621) 
yeah it did and then she but she was kind of a gossip she went around talking to everybody trying to get them all support her and nobody would support her 

Recording: (5482/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5483/ 9621) 
uh you know he is paying rent at his mother in law as was not not really his mother in law but in her so she can right uh he is he has become more responsible but responsible about a lot of things which is again at normal maturation and he is just doing it the hard way 

Recording: (5484/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5485/ 9621) 
the rail service no 

Recording: (5486/ 9621) 
well and do not you think too the that the more they have found out psychologically speaking about children and the placement of children in the family and the um throes of not having enough or or being sorely neglected because you were one of so many i mean janet and i both know the that experience from being one of eleven children raised so you know you did not have the advantages that 

Recording: (5487/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5488/ 9621) 
well i did not know if you would give them my name or yeah if you can 

Recording: (5489/ 9621) 
whatever his name is arnold schwarzenegger he is into his kind of movies i like the i liked sixth sense i loved that movie 

Recording: (5490/ 9621) 
hum 

Recording: (5491/ 9621) 
which kids 

Recording: (5492/ 9621) 
probably 

Recording: (5493/ 9621) 
i was about to say now on the record or off the 

Recording: (5494/ 9621) 
i am from columbus ohio i was born and raised in columbus uh i grew up on the east side of columbus i graduated from high school i then started working for ohio state in nineteen seventy seven and have been there here for twenty four years 

Recording: (5495/ 9621) 
yeah they are 

Recording: (5496/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5497/ 9621) 
and and that is what a lot of people are telling me you know just you know life is a struggle 

Recording: (5498/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5499/ 9621) 
it it was not easy and at first it was probably a lot harder then after you have been there for about six months and you start to just get used to things but i i took for granted coming to coming back here was 

Recording: (5500/ 9621) 
because you know the son at five already plays all these adding games and subtraction games and letter games and you know at least the day care all the stuff they have on their computer is all education stuff it is not game game it is it has a game theme to it but 

Recording: (5501/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (5502/ 9621) 
i think that uh yeah it would have been better for me if we had lived in new york 

Recording: (5503/ 9621) 
boy it would have to be um something that i actually enjoy um what happened was ever since i came to columbus almost every company i work for was bought out and sold and moved to a different state and i was not interested in that uh because my husband works for the state so obviously he is not going anywhere um so i got tired of that and that is why i kind of went to temping and stuff so it would be one with a variety um i am i say unfortunately good at accounting and stuff but that does not get to express my creative side as much so it would be um my favorite job was one where i did the accounting but i dealt with people as well and like would do presentations at seminars and stuff like that occasionally too so right 

Recording: (5504/ 9621) 
and it it is you know my mom you know she always you know what do you think i should do about this and we always talk about different things so i think i think it is kinda neat that i have been involved in a lot of a lot of the other kids that way 

Recording: (5505/ 9621) 
at our desks we had terminals that connected to a system 

Recording: (5506/ 9621) 
now i just like it anyway and i like their culture a lot 

Recording: (5507/ 9621) 
fruit loops yeah and it is like what is the difference you know besides the price 

Recording: (5508/ 9621) 
but there are those that are out there that are willing to do that 

Recording: (5509/ 9621) 
you know they should not know where the keys are if there were keys to the gun cabinet or whatever i mean the fact that a you know how do you explain your way out of your kids taking guns to school 

Recording: (5510/ 9621) 
which was scheduled in the evenings i when was working and i could not even go to therapy 

Recording: (5511/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (5512/ 9621) 
oxleys is probably the closest place 

Recording: (5513/ 9621) 
OH OKAY <LAUGH> 

Recording: (5514/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (5515/ 9621) 
my boyfriend would love to mess with this i just want you to know that he would be like taking it apart putting it back together 

Recording: (5516/ 9621) 
according to that and so uh i can not think what some of their observations were but there is usually just one or two lines of 

Recording: (5517/ 9621) 
she that is a grandmother she lets the kids pretty much you know 

Recording: (5518/ 9621) 
they go she is got it and they go on to the next guy and then all a sudden you are going off this way and they go uh six nine juliet uh where are you going and you are like uh i uh told me to and then they go oh brother you know so now you know the attention is diverted to you so that is usually what the problem is because most pilots are there are really professional yeah um-hum 

Recording: (5519/ 9621) 
i have given you plenty of opinions have not i i have just loaded them on you okay i i just have a question is do you is this a research project for a private organization or is it 

Recording: (5520/ 9621) 
you know what my parents never did because um they knew i was always level headed i always had a lot of boyfriends you know but i always i always felt like i was waiting for the right one 

Recording: (5521/ 9621) 
is that right 

Recording: (5522/ 9621) 
you mean instead of a doctor 

Recording: (5523/ 9621) 
hum um 

Recording: (5524/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5525/ 9621) 
like i said i have been here twenty five years i have seen a lot of weird stuff fact is was at baker i seen a manager that had nothing to do for ten years 

Recording: (5526/ 9621) 
from the day one 

Recording: (5527/ 9621) 
yes to but that uh more that has primarily because of necessity uh more often than not uh uh maybe even today it is less than that because it is a because of a loss of a parent or inability of a uh or parents uh being able to handle those children so yes those those things do exist and they will always have some but that is a very small percentage though scott 

Recording: (5528/ 9621) 
it does not matter how much money they are given for their education they have 

Recording: (5529/ 9621) 
when you think that our major resource is is our children and our offspring then we would better not you know 

Recording: (5530/ 9621) 
uh we are planning on moving in the spring 

Recording: (5531/ 9621) 
well number one it is a little bit smaller more controlled area <LAUGH> quiet no less and uh get my mom closer to the sister you know my sister lives up there she moved there from uh down in west virginia so you know with mom having all the peace and <LAUGH> peace and quiet she you know plus in a place that is only year old 

Recording: (5532/ 9621) 
SURE <LAUGH> 

Recording: (5533/ 9621) 
um just to get in the school there is about thirty people applying they let three in 

Recording: (5534/ 9621) 
yeah that could be right yeah 

Recording: (5535/ 9621) 
yes to some degree they should but there we go again that is just like the people when i worked in bars they would always want to hold the bartender responsible but say you could come up i give you a beer and you could give it to somebody else 

Recording: (5536/ 9621) 
all the cool apartments are on one sixty one all the great restaurants and everything so that is where i lived 

Recording: (5537/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5538/ 9621) 
um well actually it is sort of all happening in a certain area you know with you know very high unemployment like council council states um you know the sort of stereotype you know kind of bad family environment you know parents have lots of boyfriends and girlfriends drugs everything else and you know a lot of these girls that have been interviewed you know say oh you know i wanted something to love or you know we were bored so we decided to have sex and i mean i find it just totally appalling and you know a thirteen year old boy who was interviewed was saying oh you know he had you know slept with like ten girls or something and i am thinking oh my gosh you know and he is thirteen and you know had a few kids and that was it but in my opinion the main problem there is they get more support even at that age when they have they you know they get unemployment because once they have had a kid even if they are not of working age they get like a an a certain amount of money and then once they reach i think um fifteen or sixteen if they have a baby they are provided they are the top of the list for a council house so they get their own there was actually a long documentary on before i left um you know of this girl who was constantly fighting with her parents and you know her parents were at the end of their rope she got pregnant and she was like well you know hey this is my ticket to move out because she gets her own place she gets money for herself money for the baby she does not have to pay any utilities or anything and you know what more could she want you know was basically what she was saying i have got my own place i can do whatever i want i am getting money and i do not have to work and and so that i think is a very bad situation because they are almost rewarded for you know 

Recording: (5539/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5540/ 9621) 
because i had a lot of frustration built up what is next <LAUGH> got a whole list there 

Recording: (5541/ 9621) 
so they built one out in hilliard 

Recording: (5542/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5543/ 9621) 
you know and without health insurance that will cost a few hundred dollars and they have no means to help themselves at least if you assuming you are eighteen you could get a job like and try and pay for your health insurance i mean it i am not saying it would be easy but still 

Recording: (5544/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5545/ 9621) 
yeah and then you can stay as long as you want you do not you know feel obligated and everybody just brings in food you know everybody brings their own stuff and it is fun we have yeah it is from thanksgiving to christmas i mean it is just nonstop family everywhere so it is fun 

Recording: (5546/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (5547/ 9621) 
um-hum where from 

Recording: (5548/ 9621)

Recording: (5553/ 9621) 
they are uh five hours from colorado so they still bad lands are not too far away and i guess it is like nine hundred miles from here so they can still drive back so they come at least once twice a year back to ohio 

Recording: (5554/ 9621)

Recording: (5601/ 9621) 
but you know i think one of the things that you see people do a lot that really bothers me is that whole thing about 

Recording: (5602/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (5603/ 9621) 
yeah i i you know i think too i apologize to my oldest daughter ALMOST every day about the poor thing all i put her through when we were trying to grow up together and i was twenty four when she was born so i was not a child but it is like you do not have realistic expectations of what what children are capable of or what they can do because if they are really verbal and my kids always have been really verbal because i have talked to them from the moment they were born even you know when they could not talk to me that was irrelevant i was talking to them the whole obviously see i do not shut up so i would talk to them the whole time and so they would always be really verbal and so it seemed like they had a much better understanding and could do things better than they really could like when my daughter was about five we got a hamster and i said well you know you make sure you give it food and water and when it died it i was so surprised that she had not given him been giving it food and water because she did it occasionally but to a five year old you do not yeah they do not get that stuff together or when she was eleven we sold her bedroom furniture and i gave her the money to keep so she could wait to buy something else well within three or four months it was gone you know and so then the next year and a half she only had a mattress on the floor in her room because but i mean now that was bizarre now with my other kids first of all i would have better sense than to do those things or i would i would take more responsibility rather than expecting them to have it and secondly 

Recording: (5604/ 9621) 
anyway you know so just simply living 

Recording: (5605/ 9621) 
the GOVERNMENT <LAUGH> it is whoever wants to BE 

Recording: (5606/ 9621)

well i will be honest i have a lot of homosexual friends and being in the restaurant business and growing up in the restaurant business and that is how i really kind of met them when i was going to school i did not know any and i went to o u and honestly down there i did not know i did not know anybody was gay um i feel that a lot of people were i will say most of them or all of them are born that way some of them do make a choice um but i feel that it should be talked about in school um for so long it was in the closet <LAUGH> you know they did not talk about it and these kids you know had to hide it and i just think in today is world and there is so many people that are openly gay that it should be talked about more in school i do i think you know especially i just think some and women there is women that you know i had my gym teacher brook haven now that i look at it i did not know then but she was gay i mean we did not i did not think that then i do not know why but she was very manly but she was very she was very good but she was you know just not feminine at all

uh 

Recording: (5611/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5612/ 9621)

Recording: (5616/ 9621) 
so the way the university here is run i can not agree with most stuff they do 

Recording: (5617/ 9621)

Recording: (5619/ 9621) 
i met him here um the year i moved back from florida and he had just moved back from dallas he had lived there for ten years 

Recording: (5620/ 9621) 
i read and 

Recording: (5621/ 9621) 
of dialogue under one of their their cartoons and the cartoon told most of it 

Recording: (5622/ 9621) 
because i i did not own a telephone because i could not afford one and and also i thought if i had one they will call me well they would come you know if i did not get up that time on my day off they would come knocking at the door and say we need you to come for a trip 

Recording: (5623/ 9621) 
<LAUGH>

um then you submit a portfolio in the fall for review and they decide which students are good enough to be in the department 

Recording: (5628/ 9621) 
so uh you know now that is just like they consider that like urban 

Recording: (5629/ 9621) 
just employers need to be employers just need to do that on their own and it is tough to be able to trust uh business like that but it is a private business they need to be able to 

Recording: (5630/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5631/ 9621) 
lassie <LAUGH> i think i could summarize uh just with a few words of what you are meaning to say i may be wrong but i think you are really meaning to say we must get back to the family there must be two parents and they must recognize their children and do like you have just discussed uh do with them the and because today we are just drifting and drifting and drifting we uh fifty percent of uh everyone who marries has divorced within a matter of about five years as i understand the statistics today and uh unfortunately it is still increasing but there is a strong feeling that maybe this is going to slowly reverse or at least decrease not reverse probably um once again we are talking about communications too uh and the communications can be ill and they can be great uh as she is touched upon uh oh but i feel that pendulum has to swing back from the non family we are headed toward or have been headed toward and get back to a very basic family orientation it is abhorrent when i hear that uh uh oh was it seven ladies who were quote beautiful ladies are now willing to sell their uh sperm uh well that is not their sperm well whatever that is they sell uh for ten thousand dollars apiece and to be implanted in the other so that they can produce uh a quote beautiful child well a beautiful child uh and if talking about just the physical features is meaningless it is what is embodied in that body that is can be beautiful instead of just the physical features that you look at and that to me is abhorrent such a such an idea and that indeed is gonna take away from family i in my way of thinking i can not imagine that i would uh have my wife producing somebody else is child over HERE and i am going to have the same thank you that is fatherly love fatherly value fatherly instincts toward or with that child 

Recording: (5632/ 9621) 
hum 

Recording: (5633/ 9621) 
you probably know more than i do then i never went there with them because uh um my dad is very against it <LAUGH> um-hum <LAUGH> he is episcopalian so <LAUGH>

Recording: (5638/ 9621) 
i would like to seen it pass just for the fact to see what the hell they would have done with the money but uh i do not blame people for voting for the one and not vote for the other because you are talking about something twenty years i had a engineering a civil engineering friend years ago and uh i was a worked at ashland chemical which is over in dublin and i lived over where i am living now and every year they were doing work on two seventy you know so i get pissed off and uh bitch be bitching at him about it and everything you know and he would go you do not realize you know by time we get something approved through all the parameters you have got to go through and everything and then they start working on it and then they get it done it is already ten fifteen years old

you are not gonna make as much money the people are gonna say gee i am not going to them i am place else again it gets back to weaknesses in our standards in society we we could care less about anybody else we do not hey if i have problems the government is gonna help me out that is a mindset that is been entrenched for forty some years it is a mindset that if you talk to the older generations are dying off now that said we would never had in our lifetime it is a ruination of our country and if you are old enough to remember kruschev i believe krushchev is right we will bury you we will bury you internally in other words we will break you up you will separate internally you have dysfunctional people we are we are dysfunctional families if you ever work on pastoral care activity you will find out that people are so concerned about their families that they they fail they think because their family is broken up they have got single parents here they have got divorced here uh they do not know what is going on they are doing drugs well the problem is we never got involved as you said busy we make more time you know there is more time spent for soccer on sunday then going to church you talk about uh they said was it meet the press as i think slogan is a day without meet a sunday without meet the press you know day was it something like uh sunday is not a sunday without meet the press well hey that just tells you right there where our thoughts are we are only thinking of ourselves i guarantee it as you get older you start thinking a little differently and i think as you talk you should be talking to some older people i am saying people um in the in their eighties to find out how the progression of life is and how you think because when you go to estate sales all you are talking about this profit motive you are sitting on a lawns the quality of life is in the mind the person you are you you avoided all the time

Recording: (5730/ 9621) 
i do not know uh this freedom semi quasi freedom there is an illusion of freedom and a reality of freedom uh and the indian people know the big difference of that 

Recording: (5731/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5732/ 9621) 
YEAH <LAUGH> so or how hard can it be to say to a student if you have a student with an eighty i q for example and you know he is not gonna get all the details and the battles and the years and the captain is names but you just want him to get the overall gist of the french and american war was about this time uh in history and this was the result and this is how long it lasted just the main concepts well there is the kid that you say todd you study for the test and when you come in i will let you answer anything on the test you know and anything you do not know you leave blank and i will just grade what you put down 

Recording: (5733/ 9621) 
i know 

Recording: (5734/ 9621) 
the yeah um or the yeah the government mayors the you know but then look at them i mean there is another example well yeah well i mean <LAUGH> so that is not the that is not the case but it is all it is an uh uh man too you know i mean i think women would be more efficient and they would see those things because we have had to live with them forever you know even g movies that little kids are going to see if there is a woman in there 

Recording: (5735/ 9621) 
i 

Recording: (5736/ 9621) 
oh really 

Recording: (5737/ 9621) 
it is very informal here so i do not know what what we are doing but 

Recording: (5738/ 9621) 
like that like solitary but like unlimited solitary that does not seem right either but 

Recording: (5739/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5740/ 9621) 
then his parents can pick him up and everybody was annoyed my husband said i would have let her stay i do not understand why you are doing this i do not care i want her to come home the other well the bottom line it was hysterical because she and this little boy they are outside and he they are jumping and he is jumping on the trampoline i go out to him and i introduce myself and i say you know honey i said really sorry about the plans but i just you could not i just could not let you her stay there that long he goes oh that is okay my mom would never let me do that so and i am thinking you know here is everybody is acting like i am the bad guy and i am i am the one who is into right and so there i just wanna tell you one more thing that was funny because um there was something she wanted to skip a play rehearsal that i would not let her skip because it was for a party that her friends were having and i understood it was important to her but when you have commitments you you keep your commitments and so was saying he agreed with me and i said look even your dad thinks that in this case she goes so what is with him he never has an opinion how come all of a sudden he is allowed to have an opinion tell me what i can do you know it was really funny we laughed about it and i let her um i let her skip IT <LAUGH> because i decided that it was so important to her 

Recording: (5741/ 9621) 
yeah i mean but i mean we are not at a depression and and the you know the employment rate is fine and healthcare is we have got some improvements there and like i said that that student loan <LAUGH> you know uh but i just i mean so i would not say he is done a a a horrible horrible job but i mean i think that you just spend so much time focusing on other things and look at all the money that we have wasted but we could have spent that money on something else you know and you end up doing that 

Recording: (5742/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5743/ 9621) 
i think they do 

Recording: (5744/ 9621) 
is that the way jesus christ would have brought that here well some people have their opinion and i said no no i say you you wear that collar you do something about that if you do not then i realize what a spineless person you are but you will never find me in your church again so i have done what i have done but there is a lot of people out there that will read a book on native american spirituality and they will become self proclaimed spiritual leaders uh they will learn the sweats there is some people that have taken pictures of sweat lodges which you are not supposed to do uh they show step by step how to build one and tell wordyou that some kind of wood to build it out of and ninety percent of the time they tell you the wrong kind of wood um there is a way to do it and there is a way to do it uh it has to be done that way traditionally there was a reason for that um because the people of this land were given specific instructions from their creator through visions through a woman called the white buffalo calf woman that came to the people and brought them these ceremonies like the sweat lodge they brought them the sacred pipe it is not a it is not a belief thing it is a way of life and it is a way of life that is still in danger of being snuffed out but it will not be it is just it will not be it is just we gotta be careful about uh how and what you do and if you look you know native american spirituality or religion for lack of a better word ah because our people believe that religion you can not uh you can not encompass one word everything that is in the one word 

Recording: (5745/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (5746/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (5747/ 9621) 
no not at all i think in the united states it is the driving force of our of our of our government and and even like cause without without a revenue base from the taxes of corporations the you could not have nearly the things that we have had and i think to a degree they have become fairly powerful but i do not think that is necessarily a bad thing uh when the unions were really strong i thought like we were i was reading about it i thought that was a good thing as well because that supported supported the person but you could if you have good relations with your labor you do not necessarily need a union 

Recording: (5748/ 9621) 
our dorms were cleaner 

Recording: (5749/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5750/ 9621)

Recording: (5756/ 9621) 
then she would blow up on me too you know 

Recording: (5757/ 9621) 
um i can see where the people are coming from thinking that they might turn them into gay people or whatever um just because obviously you basically mimic your parents as far as what you do when you are young and things like that and obviously IF YOU SO had two male parents or whatever obviously you might be thinking <LAUGH> more towards like dating guys and things like that um i do not know if that would be really a problem though i mean i do not know if that would honestly happen 

Recording: (5758/ 9621) 
germany and everything that was really neat 

Recording: (5759/ 9621) 
and we started talking again and it was just like we had not missed any time and started dating 

Recording: (5760/ 9621)

Recording: (5761/ 9621)

Recording: (5769/ 9621) 
i sort of wore out um that and um just oh there were two reasons i left one i was getting exhausted and uh it was just so demanding and we did not know as a community how to let uh up SO I HAD TO <LAUGH> HAD TO i had to withdraw another thing was i am very into um metaphysics and studying and meditating we had no time whatsoever everybody was in there um that is one disagreement i have with intentional communities that they stay open all except in january so there is always people coming for four or five days and you have TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING IN LIFE TO THEM IN FOUR OR FIVE DAYS and plus we uh lived in um a a rural setting where we did everything ourselves plus ran a restaurant and a hardware and had a mail route and then we had all these visitors and then we and then we uh made our own bread and we uh milked a cow AND UH <LAUGH> so it is just plain hard physical work plus all the mental um stuff of dealing with people is really big questions it it was INTENSE <LAUGH> you know so that is the reason i had to quit is was like if i could leave this situation for a month or six weeks and get caught up within myself i would have been okay but that was not how it worked so had to to pull back from it <LAUGH> 

Recording: (5770/ 9621) 
i do not think it is bad because he did go to a day care when he was little before his grandmother started watching him and um um i mean it was you know you are got people you do not know watching your kid and that is kinda scary but you know you gotta check things out first before you put your kid anywhere

they are like the are they all like the people on crocodile dundee where they just no they just like 

Recording: (5853/ 9621) 
i think for the most part people could handle it um obviously i think probably more the older generations would be the ones that would have the bigger problem with it the ones that grew up like during the whole black rights movements and things like that um i could see them having a problem with it but i mean more like more the generations of today or whatever like basically anyone under the age of about forty or fifty or so i think that they could probably deal with it i mean i do not think it caused any huge problems or anything like that 

Recording: (5854/ 9621) 
it is right on their main street and they have gorgeous really neat unique things 

Recording: (5855/ 9621) 
because they done away with the uh civil service step raises which were wrong cause coulda done crummy job and got same raise as doing a good job do not get me wrong but now it is that you got people you do not even respect in management a lot of times giving the raises and they have no idea what you are even doing 

Recording: (5856/ 9621) 
and there is like nothing in it and uh you know it is like go down the list that is what i do what do YOU he just thinks i automatically know i am a mind reader <LAUGH> that is what it is <LAUGH> 

Recording: (5857/ 9621) 
i am very proud of the way her and her sister are but i just think it is because mom was home and you know there was somebody there to listen to them and it does not have to be mom i mean um you know mom can go work and dad can stay home there is nothing wrong with that either but i just think they need mom or dad there everyday when they come home so they know when they come home and they have had a really bad day and something is really bothering them they can talk to it as opposed to sitting for two or three hours and letting it kind of fade away and then when everybody comes home it is like well how how is school okay 

Recording: (5858/ 9621) 
you know i mean so it is true um with different pets 

Recording: (5859/ 9621)

Recording: (5878/ 9621) 
um well actually i wanted to learn more about it i felt like like i really have no passion towards it but i thought this would be a good way to learn about it and maybe pick up like uh 

Recording: (5879/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (5880/ 9621) 
oh i 

Recording: (5881/ 9621)

Recording: (5888/ 9621) 
you get into a situation where you really where there is a no win situation from the get go and uh uh i think that had we been able to do what we went over there to do initially it would have worked out okay but we were not so so it became a political war as everybody knows that knows anything about it 

Recording: (5889/ 9621) 
not in my lifetime he would hafta probably be a closet gay 

Recording: (5890/ 9621) 
well that is just it that is part of it because like i see my parents would not come my mother used to try to come to things at school when i would be in different things and and i really did but my father would not he just she would say well you know he just does not like that kind of thing i mean i would be in the sunny spelling bee i would be in the he he does not well too damn bad get your butt down there and pretend like you like it and so you know with our and my husband is the same way his family was his father died when he was nine he was like the adult in his family he came from a buffalo new york working class he left he never looked back either and so it is kind of like he and i are people always they say you know how we are such i i do not know we get a the schools are always so grateful to us because we organized the state chess tournaments he started the baseball league for this building you know he he does a lot of stuff i do a lot of stuff and it is simply because we are so grateful to have this family to be able to be a part of these kids lives and to go to i mean he coaches baseball he coaches you know um basketball we do not miss anything you know it does not matter what it is 

Recording: (5891/ 9621) 
went 

Recording: (5892/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5893/ 9621) 
oh yeah it is 

Recording: (5894/ 9621)

Recording: (5895/ 9621) 
she does a really wonderful job because she has a flair for interior design and so that you know presents itself in her the way she sets everything up in the stores it is very attractive 

Recording: (5896/ 9621) 
yeah being three i did not really know anything heart attack ate too much of that good stuff 

Recording: (5897/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5898/ 9621) 
uh basically what you need more is like recreation centers or something in their own neighborhood 

Recording: (5899/ 9621) 
kids because a lot times maybe they do not get that at home so they are really looking to choose the right thing to do and through school and through education that is their avenue to go there 

Recording: (5900/ 9621) 
so that like the just the sheer numbers of it i think 

Recording: (5901/ 9621) 
first year finishing it up oh yeah oh it is definitely the the beginning <LAUGH> 

Recording: (5902/ 9621) 
and so um my parents retired here let us see they have been here i do not know four or five years maybe 

Recording: (5903/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5904/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> um yeah i just realized that like i do not know it is just different then i thought so if like i am not happy in a place like i should not stay and just be miserable about it 

Recording: (5905/ 9621) 
jerry i mean jerry springer 

Recording: (5906/ 9621) 
thinking about journalism um design 

Recording: (5907/ 9621) 
OH MY GOSH 

Recording: (5908/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5909/ 9621) 
my sister in law is one of them she is just too stupid 

Recording: (5910/ 9621) 
because we could know that he will need that someday i would never have done it 

Recording: (5911/ 9621) 
tied up to a fence you know i think they deserve to die because with the prisons and the overcrowding that is a whole another subject you know that it is just amazing to me so many people are in there that should be dead i feel because we are just paying for them to live in there 

Recording: (5912/ 9621) 
oh wow yeah 

Recording: (5913/ 9621) 
i do not i do not know if that is what percolates it it is very different in the public schools the catholic school the public school you have all the problems of society school you have the drugs you have the absentee parents you have the delinquency in the catholic school they just you do not have that for one thing uh ya know it is oriented around the church even though we are not catholic it is still oriented as so there is lot of values that permeates everything well they do not do that in the public school because if you do that somebody is gonna get ticked off it is the wrong value and why are you doing this to my kid um so i think that is missing that is a problem within the school the public schools uh so just seems to be more distraction from the educational process know mean when you are in the catholic school and you are in classroom they deal with the discipline if they need to course part the problem way they deal with it is they take the real problems and send them oh back to the PUBLIC SCHOOLS uh but in the public schools you just have to deal with this all the time and i think that it it is harder for the teachers to teach cause there is too much stuff in the way of they need really they are there to do 

Recording: (5914/ 9621) 
um i went to me see i applied to emory harvard duke university of chicago and washington university so i got into three of those and they they were neat places but 

Recording: (5915/ 9621) 
yeah there was you know there was no property 

Recording: (5916/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (5917/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5918/ 9621) 
and by the end of the first week or two they were no longer scared of the magic box and could continue to operating systems word um the goal of learning operating systems is real simple if you are playing with computer and you screw something up the worst thing you can possibly do is screw it up so badly that you have to start over 

Recording: (5919/ 9621) 
yeah i do not even know what their holidays are i i do not know 

Recording: (5920/ 9621) 
i think so feels like it is too close to my mouth really but 

Recording: (5921/ 9621) 
i mean i think that is the best way to address it and as far as the homosexual i think there is kids who say well maybe i am gay i do not know if i am gay or what well hopefully they will know their true identity eventually 

Recording: (5922/ 9621) 
oh it is most of it is liberal and they have always find some way to misrepresent like uh kirwan 

Recording: (5923/ 9621) 
indirectly yes 

Recording: (5924/ 9621) 
this will be something good to get on your tape and they have got people over there where i work at that they will give them the days off if their cats are sick 

Recording: (5925/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5926/ 9621) 
no i do not think it was because i grew up just basic not even really christian just really not no real religion and i would been going to presbyterian church as i was about nineteen years old looking for something a church i just had a feeling that i wanted to have that in my life because i would never had that before <LAUGH> and so i was just looking around and i was open to anything i had listened to eastern religions and i have listened to the jehovah is witnesses and and and then when i read in the book of mormon it is just i it is a feeling of like like i felt like i had heard it before and it made sense to me and and so that is why i really felt at home with this and that is why i decided 

Recording: (5927/ 9621) 
yeah <LAUGH> 

Recording: (5928/ 9621) 
well that is probably the roof right there so 

Recording: (5929/ 9621) 
with the n double a c p 

Recording: (5930/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> i figure when the time comes we will just have to figure it OUT <LAUGH> 

Recording: (5931/ 9621) 
makes her look good 

Recording: (5932/ 9621) 
or do you want to run over me is that what you want to do 

Recording: (5933/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (5934/ 9621) 
i think 

Recording: (5935/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5936/ 9621) 
well uh my youngest son married a catholic girl who was from a large catholic family and their kids are going to a catholic school 

Recording: (5937/ 9621) 
will that sacred heat will 

Recording: (5938/ 9621) 
it is great <LAUGH> because he is heavy he is killing my back <LAUGH> oh yeah that is what everyone said you think <LAUGH> 

Recording: (5939/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5940/ 9621) 
but uh then there is a lot you know that they could do with that mall too that might make me even wanna go there more 

Recording: (5941/ 9621) 
um-hum <LAUGH> 

Recording: (5942/ 9621) 
um i have not personally researched it but i have seen um i would personally research it if i was president um documentaries and whatnot and things on twenty twenty which i do not whole heartedly believe just because it is on tv and they say it is so but if it is true and it probably is just because a lot of people will research it once it is on tv um that three strikes and you are out has really seemed to work in california because most of the people that are committing the violent crimes with guns or rapes or what not um are doing most of the crime so once they are locked up yeah it costs more money to house them for life but they are saving so much because crime has gone down because these people are in jail and not on the streets anymore so they do not have to catch them they do not have to process them etcetera um so i would really like to see that and plus i think once that really is in the works and really working and we are really do we are gonna say we are doing instead of like little parents no honey do not do that no honey do not do that you know what i mean because i think that is part of our problem too 

Recording: (5943/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5944/ 9621) 
well put this way when i was a kid you did not wanna be brought home by the police you were actually scared of police nowadays what is kids scared of nothing 

Recording: (5945/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (5946/ 9621) 
uh no that is why i wanna do the hiking things i am like ready i can get a like a visa because i somebody told me wow you know you go some some places in europe you might have some problems getting a tourist visa because sometimes they work illegal

Recording: (5951/ 9621) 
just carrying around a gun and shooting someone 

Recording: (5952/ 9621) 
you know it is a real worried and you really have to think about it when you start getting there because it was tough dropping them off when they were six weeks old and you are going oh geezy are we doing the right thing you know but you know some of the stuff they do and some of the stuff they learn and come home with we sit down and talk about it and we are just like i do not think we could have ever dreamed up all this stuff you know and you know kept them entertained all day long by ourselves you know there is no kids in the neighborhood like it was when we were kids you know they are all in daycare <LAUGH> they you know you know they just are not around anymore it is not the same anymore where you know every other house had some kids and mom was home and stuff so you know they have made a lot of friends through there and they still the daughter is in a different school still associates with friends that are in other school systems that she met at the daycare so 

Recording: (5953/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (5954/ 9621) 
uh it counts if you are touching the ground or if something that you are sitting on is touching 

Recording: (5955/ 9621)

Recording: (5956/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5957/ 9621)

Recording: (5959/ 9621) 
all right 

Recording: (5960/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5961/ 9621) 
it would be nice but no um <LAUGH> SO 

Recording: (5962/ 9621) 
i i do not care about like having to do it like my mom even wants me to do hers over summer i am like okay fine <LAUGH> 

Recording: (5963/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5964/ 9621) 
oh did they 

Recording: (5965/ 9621) 
right right 

Recording: (5966/ 9621) 
yeah and you know i would i would like to have another job but i would i would love i know you will say this is really stupid but i would love to have a monday through friday eight to five job never work another evening a saturday or a sunday if if it can be now i know i will probably not be able to do that because o s u wants me to come back there so as a contractor so i do not know you know 

Recording: (5967/ 9621) 
and finally uh i do not know whether there were we had uh a piper cub observation plane i do not know whether he saw him or who but anyway they finally figured that he was in a a a tunnel for the railroad 

Recording: (5968/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (5969/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5970/ 9621) 
nailed over it instead of replacing the door so 

Recording: (5971/ 9621)

Recording: (5973/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5974/ 9621) 
it was columbus he went to uh fort hayes 

Recording: (5975/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (5976/ 9621) 
and nobody is worth that you know so that is what i am saying it is so retarded uh over i do not mean to use that word in a bad way but it is ridiculous that is better word uh that that people have to uh uh have to throw out a case that they may have a legitimate case because they can not afford the legal help so i think that is wrong in this country the land of the free and the home of the brave yeah right you know it is land of the free all right yeah it is free country but it will cost you 

Recording: (5977/ 9621) 
and you know just sometimes it is just like they are like oh well she could not understand or something like that but for the most part i there is you know no weirdness he is had he had a few cousins you know make some little comments but 

Recording: (5978/ 9621) 
gonna be a really busy day and i would the same thing at port columbus you know i i would see all these cars but it would be just about the same traffic and i am like and i mentioned somebody i go where are the extra airplanes and they go they can not add extra airplanes it is they have certain routes they can do they just hafta put bigger airplanes on so he said you know you will see larger airplanes when it is holiday time so they can put more people on so 

Recording: (5979/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5980/ 9621) 
it is better in terms of the uh city government seems to the people seem to be more aware of what they are doing and it is not oh well i will just do this it is kind of like you know there is some brains down there <LAUGH> 

Recording: (5981/ 9621)

Recording: (5983/ 9621) 
uh i was only there for couple weeks in the harbor i never set foot on land 

Recording: (5984/ 9621) 
um-hum um-hum 

Recording: (5985/ 9621) 
lived in the dorms my freshman year and then i moved into a house with a bunch of guys i met yeah so what was different um one the things that i really enjoyed that was different is the traffic and that really no that really that really became really became uh interesting and different for me when i started working for a courier service winter quarter i took off i took all classes off winter quarter and worked for a courier service because i needed some money and i love driving and let me tell you it is really really different driving around in the big city compared to out in the country man i mean you are flying down seventy one or seventy through town and you go as fast as everybody else is going and if they are going eighty you are going eighty <LAUGH> and if they are going two you are going two yeah i mean my dad i brought him down to columbus few times because my dad and i are real close and um i am driving around AND i was zipping between cars and he is like i forgot what it is like living in a city because he useta live in chicago but um it that is one of the things i really enjoy one of things i do not like about living the big city is is like but i have gotten used to but i uh i do not like the fact that every time you look up in the night sky and all you see is this like orange haze <LAUGH> you can not see stars very well uh the noise i mean there is always noise i remember last year living in the dorms every morning at two thirty in the morning there was the trash truck that picked up some trash from a bar right behind where we lived and i lived in taylor so it is this it is it is in a t shape and then the side of the building all the sound just rolls right up the wall and this trash truck made so much stinking noise it is ridiculous every single morning at two thirty yeah i did not i i developed uh i developed the the the ability to sleep through anything which is and that is that is so one of the fascinating things when i go home dead silence dead silence and that is now where i have a problem sleeping because it is because there is no noise there is no noise i am so used to like turning my radio on and drowning out all the background sound that i hafta like have music on in the ROOM so in that down here um-hum yeah i really like the city i like the night life everything in in ashland mansfield shuts down at nine thirty ten oclock and it all starts up at nine thirty ten oclock here in columbus and that is so cool i love it man i love going out clubbing at like two oclock in the morning <LAUGH> um red zone red zone we usually they open up a nine or ten oclock depending on if they got a special show coming in or not but that is the place i really like going um they uh they are open till usually two thirty two oclock all depends um i also found something fascinating um i uh came to columbus and you know raised in this really really really conservative extremely christian religious community of ashland and i came to columbus and i started meeting you know i started meeting the extremely taboo group of homosexuals and i have found some the most fascinating people on this planet are homosexuals um and they are not nearly the they are not the the the evil people that that everybody back home in our community always said they were you know it is just like these are normal people you know i may not agree with what they are doing but they are normal people and i have met some really cool people who are who are homosexuals and that leading where that was going was um we went to axis which is uh one of the home well it is one of the gay um uh dance clubs in columbus it is um it is on high street it is down in uh it is down in the german no it is not all the way is it the 

Recording: (5986/ 9621) 
i am 

Recording: (5987/ 9621) 
you know they want to be judged as like everybody else but you know i think um they have so many different ideas and not that either one of them is right but still um i i think there is always going to barrier there they are just kids are just not all kids are going to get along you know i mean 

Recording: (5988/ 9621) 
my background 

Recording: (5989/ 9621) 
and you know you can have a hard thing there but then if you teach the teachers that they are not gonna be quiet and they are not gonna you know um look at this flattery 

Recording: (5990/ 9621) 
we have not been there in a while but i mean we do go 

Recording: (5991/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5992/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5993/ 9621) 
and so it is the thing is though it is almost like i am really glad that willing to say i just can not make those uh he would let he would let my daughter who is he left left her at the movies one night they went to the movies there was no um the movie they went to see was sold out the next one was not gonna start until nine thirty which means this kid is twelve years old so that would have been eleven thirty twelve you know at the lennox he leaves her there with one of her friends some boy and although this tomboy who is just amazing but so anyhow uh he left her there and uh they said they called me but i i was running the sweeper so i did not hear the phone so left her there and he said that she was gonna call back you know at at a certain time and i was gonna tell her what she could or could not do so i said you know well you are gonna have to come home you know he is gonna have to come and get you oh come on no we are not gonna do that i you know you can not be this late so he went back down picked them and i said let the kid come to our house he can come here until eleven 

Recording: (5994/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (5995/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5996/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5997/ 9621) 
YEAH <LAUGH> yeah <LAUGH> um-hum 

Recording: (5998/ 9621) 
you know you know what i mean 

Recording: (5999/ 9621) 
the bad place is the television things that they have on the programs they have on and i think that that is had a lot to do with changing our younger generation and the way they think the way they act what their morals are and i think that is why they are having more shootings in schools and uh i uh the programs are terrible i think that they need to really redo them there is too much profanity there is too much sex there is too much just do what i want i gotta do my own thing that is where the when i want to do my own thing started he says with the women is feminist MOVEMENT <LAUGH> and it probably did and it probably did have something to do with it uh because after all so much speaking up and they want to do things my bing crosby who was it no um 

Recording: (6000/ 9621) 
there is the ones that will get out there with their picket signs and raise hell okay 

Recording: (6001/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (6002/ 9621) 
yeah exactly and it is just it is just ridiculous but so many people do not seem to think that way and i do think yeah access it would help if access were restricted or at least if they were more careful about it i mean it seems like even the laws that there are in place now are not necessarily followed and you know that kind of thing 

Recording: (6003/ 9621) 
cause they are so stylish 

Recording: (6004/ 9621) 
it is difficult you feel alone a lot of the time um and i am not as liberal as i used to be uh it is i think with age it gets tempered a little bit but still tend to be a little more liberal and it is uh you know it does not matter who i vote for they are gonna lose uh and i just stay out a lot of DISCUSSIONS was my our mother raised us in a way that we were always allowed to discuss politics and religion anything we wanted to uh but you know she would stop if we got to point where we were getting physical or name calling or something like that and it was long after i left home i actually before i realized that not everybody is THAT WAY not everybody wants to hear your views um so i particularly around my in laws they are very conservative of southern ohio uh raised during the depression um in a depressed area so it i have learned my mother in law took anytime you disagreed with her as a personal attack on her so i just learned you are not to say anything yeah uh my father in law was not that way but my mother in law was 

Recording: (6005/ 9621) 
very different <LAUGH> uh just been a lot of innovations and 

Recording: (6006/ 9621)

Recording: (6021/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6022/ 9621) 
yeah <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6023/ 9621) 
and i did have a very serious relationship in florida uh he was quite a bit younger than i was and i knew he wanted children and i never wanted children unfortunately i i love animals and things but i just never decided i never wanted children and i knew he eventually would so uh i was engaged to him but i decide to 

Recording: (6024/ 9621) 
wow i am getting i am GETTING NERVOUS <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6025/ 9621) 
hum um-hum um 

Recording: (6026/ 9621) 
to the most part yeah i mean obviously like theysaid they came out and said thecatholic church was against it but at the same time like with the research things like that where they are saying that it could be a mental disorder of some sorts where i mean they could not can notso much really condemn it to to the point anymore that they used to 

Recording: (6027/ 9621) 
but it is because most people would have sold it and moved to a more expensive home and had a bigger mortgage so it is just that kind of thing 

Recording: (6028/ 9621) 
uh i do not know actually probably if i went up there now i would like it but um but it is not that i it is i do not like it as well as columbus at all mainly i suppose because of the university 

Recording: (6029/ 9621) 
just you know 

Recording: (6030/ 9621) 
but we really ever really have not talked about that but my ex wife is got family here so uh you know she comes in about two or three weeks at least out of a summer 

Recording: (6031/ 9621) 
heard about that but the same principle applies but i am talking about just every day things uh that uh people who if you wanna talk children primarily uh there is no penalty any more uh parents are scared to death uh to pick up one up and spank them um with their bare hands or or to make them stand in a corner because they considered and i am going back to the word harassment child abuse and harassment of consequence um and a hard uh and penalty can be a very very simple thing a mother can simply look at janie and say janie you should not do that 

Recording: (6032/ 9621) 
oh yeah um-hum 

Recording: (6033/ 9621) 
well uh yeah i think it is real important to really good uh get a good uh feel for how you are and all your beliefs and all that they have to really match and um and if they do not um then it is not ever going to work because because there is always gonna be conflict and friction and all that kind of thing so i think it is real important and there is no age limit on that to when you really feel <noisegood> about yourself and you really know what you want to do then that is the only time that you can really commit and say yeah we do have a mutual thing and young people their you know there is so many different infatuations to start with that they get blinded and they get you know off course and everything else and and then it does not stay the same i mean it is all exciting and and all that and then it you know i think it is kind of <LAUGH>

yeah NO <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6044/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6045/ 9621) 
that um encompasses the uh theory that all things happen for a reason even though it seems like it is chaos even though it seems like it is an accident uh there is a flow of spirit in this world things are moving at a pace that they are supposed to move at and things happen and death is part of life physical death and that is one of the things i also learned through this was that you do not die you do not physically maybe you know there is no denying that but spiritually not even physical death can break that it will not 

Recording: (6046/ 9621)

i think i think it is i think it is fair i think it should be that domestic partners should be should be covered i think there should probably be some uh you know some some restrictions there should be some level of 

Recording: (6057/ 9621) 
yeah we had a ah my mom has a friend that does ultrasounds 

Recording: (6058/ 9621)

Recording: (6062/ 9621) 
did not have it done through ceremony nothing like that and even the man that he followed for a while sitting in a rest home over in south dakota now because he is old he is on his way out and he was a road man gave his life you know for eighty nine tribes to help them find and refine their connection with their spirituality that they would lost um because of the missionaries bringing christianity i mean um 

Recording: (6063/ 9621) 
yeah yeah my best friend lives in on outside canberra and she has a lot of medical problems but huh 

Recording: (6064/ 9621) 
uh i was exposed to a lot of men who were not brought up with as i was but there were a lot of them that were 

Recording: (6065/ 9621) 
names i uh actually read a story in some book about this black lady that was having like her ninth and tenth kid and she did not know what she had twins and she did not know what to name them and she would run out of names that she liked so they brought her um lunch in to her and the nurse jokingly said or the aid or something why do not you just pick couple of names off the menu so she named them lemonjello and orangello lemon jello orange jello she picked lemon jello orange jello and turned them into lemonjello and orangello <LAUGH> denise and denephew <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6066/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6067/ 9621) 
you know technically there is insanity and there is not insanity but in my opinion there is nobody who ever killed anybody who is not insane and uh just to to knock them out is is not appropriate they need to be we need to try to save them i mean not in the terms of a christian saving but uh to make them work that off and uh face it and come in their own mind to their own guilt and um <LAUGH> um so i got two sides to that once they need to work because they did it and the other side is if we keep uh i i believe in the uh uh reincarnation and the law of cause and effect and if a person murders somebody they need they will they will pay for that later there is no question about that in the next life but also i think that they should be made to face their um their guilt and what they have done and and a lot of them do not they say that hardened criminals real hard criminals will not ever admit that they did anything wrong and they have to they need to 

Recording: (6068/ 9621) 
to get them thinking about it then they will start to notice it in their life and once they start noticing it they will start getting more and more into it 

Recording: (6069/ 9621) 
do not say oh well your son is gonna be gay he is two right now let us you know change this so it so it does not come out to be a problem or whatever but i mean i think they need to leave that to the decision of the people 

Recording: (6070/ 9621) 
this 

Recording: (6071/ 9621) 
you can not you can not be mad at somebody for choosing a lifestyle you just can not life is too short you know i mean you can love them either way it does not make any difference 

Recording: (6072/ 9621) 
right same way with kids if you have a penalty for them they will learn their lesson but it is also the parent that has to set the example and there is too many older folks right now i do not think because of two people have to work outside the house they get home they are aggravated they are upset somebody else have had their kids all day and it is it is it is terrible that the situations got that way but i do feel that the older people including our government people and everybody that is at the top has to set the example and stick with it 

Recording: (6073/ 9621) 
as he was speaking and as he started to speak i realized too another thing that i really feel has a tremendous impression on how we as people are doing here but how the politicians are is because the world in essence is getting smaller because the communication has gotten better and all these other countries and us are just like all one country anymore or something i think that is had a tremendous influence also on our politics and on we as a people 

Recording: (6074/ 9621) 
oh uh-huh 

Recording: (6075/ 9621) 
now that was up to age eighteen to or there about to i think that the you said get back to the very beginning of the birth and up to kindergarten so forth i that is that is the family but uh i think that we in our educational program we really need to start teaching uh what i call the older values uh but but but good values i whether they are old or new but good values and i think we really need to have that established within our educational system uh starting in the elementary right on up to college i think there ought to be a number of college uh courses uh that that devoted exclusively for this so that those students can go back and uh assist in teaching but i think that many of the courses other courses ought to have elements within them that are teaching value family values um i could even so go so far as to saying chemistry or botany or psychology uh any one of those those are specialized subject and and but the i think there are elements that they can have within each one of those talking about family value family value uh and that will help them permeate the entire society and but it is got to start back here in the first and i think 

Recording: (6076/ 9621) 
and sooner or later you know all the people that have gotten into political offices and public service i guarantee you they went in it with the ideal of wanting to help and make a difference but but once they get in there it is such a bureaucracy 

Recording: (6077/ 9621) 
and it is not just like one group of people 

Recording: (6078/ 9621) 
that that is what is making the these kids think they they can do it i just really think 

Recording: (6079/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6080/ 9621) 
oh you do know 

Recording: (6081/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> YEAH 

Recording: (6082/ 9621) 
in english um-hum 

Recording: (6083/ 9621) 
yeah so i i have experience in that and i i am thankful that it was always a peaceful sort of thing <LAUGH> although what is going on inside your head and your body is not that peaceful yeah 

Recording: (6084/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (6085/ 9621) 
for example so you should name her tamara 

Recording: (6086/ 9621) 
oh i have just the same opinion i think most people have as the tv 

Recording: (6087/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (6088/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6089/ 9621) 
with that boy 

Recording: (6090/ 9621) 
pot is never been uh never been associated with any kind of a crime that were some a violent crime of any 

Recording: (6091/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6092/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (6093/ 9621) 
then you have a choice there you would not necessarily uh have you should have had more self control and not had the child do not expect me to pay for your uh lack of uh will power that is that is a selfish attitude that is stealing as well 

Recording: (6094/ 9621) 
i see no i mean it it 

Recording: (6095/ 9621) 
in a way yeah i think that would be good yeah maybe a new name 

Recording: (6096/ 9621) 
you know the crime you can not really stop and other things that happen just you know too much partying around i mean that is why i left twelfth AVENUE because i could not you know but you know just everybody uh the neighbors being loud and everything and my mom is older so she can not really put up with any of that and 

Recording: (6097/ 9621) 
i am just kind of appalled what they put on the news anyway it is not usually what i consider news it is lot a human interest stories and things like that which 

Recording: (6098/ 9621) 
i really and it is bizarre 

Recording: (6099/ 9621) 
um i do not know i mean i i like florida just because it is not cold and it is it is really nice but it rains a lot i mean and i i mean i i would rather live out west because it is like a dry heat as opposed to being i mean it is nice that it is ninety degrees but it is not nice that it is like ninety percent humidity i mean that is kind of kind of sucks but um it is just different to live in florida and how you think of florida being is real different like um i like it because kind of the drivers are not so insane like they are here like people are a little bit more laid back just because like um i know in parts it is really insane but like sometimes just people would just like because it is all because it is nice weather people do not get so like aggravated by like here it is like cold and and grey and you just wanna like yell at people in your car and stuff or something i do not know i do not know if people is deal is 

Recording: (6100/ 9621) 
basically because the plans which the utilities had for our locations they could not provide to us because of the uh the vesture ruling so we had to go out and um do our own surveys become self educated through uh courses uh through a t t and through purdue university it was i think o u had some courses and um ultimately the university here now has i think a major in telecommunication group but uh the projects basically we were going from a um putting together a network itself and uh we had a you think of a party line system what they used call daisy chain in the industry uh you had to wait and wait for your turn to get on to a data network and we got down to point where we went to a spoke network where everyone had dedicated pipe 

Recording: (6101/ 9621) 
well i have been see i was not much i my being here and my daughter being there i did not really have the uh time with her that i wished i would have had you know but uh uh her mother would you know would not did her all right and everything but i wished that i would have been more involved in her growing up and i think two people families are generally better you know for not necessarily living being you know its about being married and everything but 

Recording: (6102/ 9621) 
shawn is in yeah uh-huh um uh we do not have enough saxophones sure we could use you <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6103/ 9621) 
yeah my brother well he is the oldest oldest but two sisters pretty much all the ones i really care about two sisters and their husbands 

Recording: (6104/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6105/ 9621) 
uh it was not anything too huge i think it had about twelve hundred people in it or so 

Recording: (6106/ 9621) 
yeah like a lot of people like i do not i do not know why a lot of people go but like with a a lot of people i know it is like go to hear really good MUSIC and like it is amazing like what happens you know like people together and like people dancing together you look out and everybody is dancing you know and like music is really good and everybody is really into it and working 

Recording: (6107/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6108/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6109/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6110/ 9621) 
most people i associate with in this and that are a lot more involved in their with their kids than say our parents were as kids you know 

Recording: (6111/ 9621) 
i 

Recording: (6112/ 9621) 
and but you know that there and goes back to uh you know the quality or the quantity i mean if obviously this poor kid you know apparently was so miserable in his life that he was going down the stairs in basement to you know to figure out some way of uh reaching his nirvana or whatever you know and uh then his parents did not have a clue or if they did they did not care you know 

Recording: (6113/ 9621) 
but at the same time it is not like they had the intent to do it so i can not say anything too incredibly severe um but i mean i almost think it should be considered basically child neglect things like that um basically the same penalties that you would run into for that um but i mean they obviously do need to make it more severe because obviously your kids has the opportunity to kill themselves with a gun 

Recording: (6114/ 9621) 
oh yes definitely in england too 

Recording: (6115/ 9621) 
that he did not 

Recording: (6116/ 9621) 
yeah so yeah and a lot people turn eighteen when they are in high school so i am sure they can go get one there 

Recording: (6117/ 9621)

Recording: (6119/ 9621) 
yeah <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6120/ 9621) 
yeah eighty four 

Recording: (6121/ 9621) 
oh it is just so the environment of course is incredibly beautiful um and everybody is more uh i think more open or more receptive to relationships and um you know i think it is a much friendlier place and then uh i i just think the vibrations are higher out there you just do not have poverty well if anybody is in poverty in oregon it is because they have chosen to live a simple life it is not a you know because they can not get jobs and things like that although the ECONOMY IN OREGON is not that great but you know they say in eugene that even the dishwashers have p h d is they <LAUGH> well the the um the level of the years of education per capita is probably the highest in the country 

Recording: (6122/ 9621) 
are not there other important roles what would those nuns be where would your mother possibly been if she went to catholic school i take it where would she have been if it were not for the nuns why we put nuns down hey they worked lot less than your mother is even getting compensated for and they had a very important role for your development even though you are generation is removed 

Recording: (6123/ 9621) 
yeah YEAH <LAUGH> and the funny thing about that is if i heard one of those songs once i might not be that turned off by it <LAUGH> BUT IF YOURE GONNA play it at me you know six times in three hours <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6124/ 9621) 
i heard something the other day that really really upset me i was at um this convention downtown the convention center and uh one of the ladies that was presenting one of the workshops is a college professor in english at one of the ohio colleges and she said when she started teaching in nineteen eighty five they would always she teaches writing technical writing for people to do when they get out into the industry world reports and stuff she said they used to say gear your writing to a person who is in the eighth grade 

Recording: (6125/ 9621) 
that is great 

Recording: (6126/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6127/ 9621) 
well actually i have picked up a part time job just in the past month or two so i am i am working for a research firm just for the convenience of the hours i i want to get back into the nursing field but right now i just can not take that much time away because that would be least an eight hour shift and i do not think that we are ready for that <laughyet> he is a teacher um-hum he works at a high school yeah he teaches ninth and tenth graders <LAUGH> no I do not think that at all <LAUGH> i would be deceiving myself i think i i guess when i i heard about him i am just like oh my gosh i can not believe all of the the things that these kids are experiencing i did not know about whatever until i was much much older i did not worry about that when i was that age and it is kind of scary 

Recording: (6128/ 9621) 
and uh and they are not the kind that would go out and just shoot any animal shoot it they would use it food they sometimes they i know one time that they gave it to a family that was uh did not have any money and did not have any food they did went and killed some animals and gave it to and i do not have a problem with that uh uh but my brother in law was very much opposed to any kind of gun control he he believes whatever charleton heston tells him 

Recording: (6129/ 9621)

Recording: (6139/ 9621) 
i think it would probably i i think it would be certainly interesting 

Recording: (6140/ 9621) 
um yes and no like i said i think the average person is pretty decent person i mean i do not think that there is anything violent or that THERES anything wrong with them but at the same time it is just the media focuses on the one is that are out of control and makes a big deals of the ones that are out of control and i think that sort of what people pick up the perception to be i mean they do not they do not show about like when people are helping people out or things like that when the local high school is like volunteering at like the local senior citizens home or something like that 

Recording: (6141/ 9621) 
but i am like if test scores are identical and they have the exact same experience you know objective ways 

Recording: (6142/ 9621) 
because i do not know it just was like if i get pregnant i get pregnant that you do not know of what you really have to go through of having a baby you know because i guess i really did not care if hey if i got pregnant i got pregnant it did not it did not really you know register in my mind that this will you know not ruin but it was it will change your whole life

Recording: (6153/ 9621) 
well i guess i would have to say i do not necessarily like middle school but see when you get a special ed certificate you are certified kindergarten through twelfth so i did several years in a high school when i was first out of college i did high school first then i went to elementary while my kids were in elementary so i could kind of keep in touch with what they were supposed to be learning you know and then six years ago i went to the middle school and i have decided that i am too old to keep up with these kids not only are they learning disability and a d d but they are middle schoolers and they have like hormones running rampant all over the outside of their bodies you can not tell which is the hormones and which is the a d d and which is the learning disability but like i said i only have two more years to go so i guess i can live through that 

Recording: (6154/ 9621) 
i think it is better probably at the do not let them say anything about it you know and most of the people will you know like when you get to a i lived in the barracks a lot of time but i mean you know lot of people you know they get their own places off base you know and who cares what they are i mean i do not care you know like say i have gay friends that you know and i do not care what they do i mean if THEYRE old enough to do whatever the heck they want to do you know 

Recording: (6155/ 9621)

Recording: (6162/ 9621) 
um it is an ego trip that is all basically it is like look i can do this 

Recording: (6163/ 9621)

Recording: (6165/ 9621) 
basically uh it is just the talk and stuff it is not uh like you know what i mean uh i am black i am better or i am white i am better it is it is none of that 

Recording: (6166/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (6167/ 9621)

Recording: (6169/ 9621) 
and it is if you know any teenagers the more strict you make it the more they rebel 

Recording: (6170/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6171/ 9621) 
i you know from my perspective which is skewed of course to me i think it just seems that way i mean it was we are only talking about ten cases that is not very many you know i mean you could by coincidence have them all be african american um if i were african american i think i would have a different perspective and i you know i do not do not live in a neighborhood where we see a lot of police so uh you know i just do not i am i am not in touch with it with that situation 

Recording: (6172/ 9621) 
so if you if you you can not you could not bring any any like pet is back say if you had a dog could you bring it back to the states so you have to leave all those

oh well we really wants to go he lived in california that is where that family i told you about was the and when he was or sixteen and he really wants to go back so we will probably end up there sometime but after i finish school and after he works for a little while and i work and so that we can have enough money i mean we do not need to have a ton but we just should be at least a little out of debt AND SO yeah <LAUGH> something 

Recording: (6176/ 9621) 
it is just 

Recording: (6177/ 9621)

Recording: (6178/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (6179/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6180/ 9621) 
we have definitely made some progress in that direction i still think that there is considerable progression that needs to be made um i was just talking to someone a couple of weeks ago who is a fellow history major her and actually her brother is a fellow history major too and a friend of mine i do not know him all that well which apparently her family i mean she is she is double major in history and chemistry she plans to go to med school her parents her family supports her in this but they have made it painfully clear that when it she should not plan on having a career because she is gonna hafta raise children at some point which is uh that is not the way things should work in my belief uh and and the fact that it is like the males telling the daughter like this is how things need to be i think i mean you know i think an individual individual should have the choice but i feel i mean i am concerned about a a uh like this push to the right that is sort of going on hoping it is sort of dieing out but i mean it seemed a little scarier back in like ninety four ninety five but uh i think uh uh we have reached a point where because not all of the advances have been one hundred percent successful the the opposition is criticizing the advance 

Recording: (6181/ 9621) 
but when he did have something to do with him it was kinda strange they would go out and whistle at girls and stuff like that 

Recording: (6182/ 9621) 
yeah the big things 

Recording: (6183/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (6184/ 9621) 
yeah pretty much 

Recording: (6185/ 9621)

Recording: (6255/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (6256/ 9621) 
i at this point i blame it on the administration um and the citizens of columbus have not i mean uh two years ago or was it three years ago now they defeated a levy you should never defeat a school levy 

Recording: (6257/ 9621) 
that makes it hard like if you got like a if like you and you got a family you know you know you take you if you you wanted to like spend the night on the town with your you know with your family man that is that kinda like blows your whole budget for the year 

Recording: (6258/ 9621) 
they will just take one scripture and they will expand it um and and they will just run with that one scripture and then there are also churches that will just deletes and they will in the in in their minds they will delete certain sections of the scripture that they do not like first corinthians chapter twelve talks about um spiritual gifts and that is one of the big things that i am into down here in columbus and the fact that they still exist like healing people and spiritual gifts like healing people and and um the extremely taboo um religious topic among a lot of churches is the gift of tongues whether it is dead whether it is not whether it is inspired whether it is not inspired yadda yadda blah blah well i had not even heard about it until i got to columbus because and and i know the bible pretty well and i had not even heard about it until i got to columbus and i get to columbus and i am like okay this is pretty cool i went home and i am talking to some people in my parents church and they are like oh yeah um we just do not really talk about that very often and i am just 

Recording: (6259/ 9621)

Recording: (6260/ 9621)

Recording: (6265/ 9621) 
um-hum um-hum 

Recording: (6266/ 9621) 
oh there always has been there always has been i think a lot of people feel that kids a lot of kids are on medication today that should not be but um i think that is the fault of the school or the parents or some doctor that like for example when we kids in worthington to a doctor we have a list of three doctors that we work with and we know that they will not just give this kid a pill if he does not have eight out of the twelve symptoms or whatever so we refer them to those doctors and then if this those doctors are pretty conservative too and if they put them on meds it is usually just for the school day not during the summer not over vacation not after five oclock not on the weekends and it is just to help them focus and then these doctors also ask for reports back from the teachers and if you do not see any appreciable difference in two or three weeks then you take the kid off and you try something else and some kids medication is like the difference between night and day you go back in observe the kid you can not believe it is the same kid other kids does not phase them they might as well be drinking a glass of water well since they have side effects like they stunt your growth and they subdue your appetite and some of the other you know some kids get headaches from dexadrine and aderal so i say you know if it works use it if it if it does not work just forget it but you know a lot of people feel that too many kids are on this stuff because there may be just not able to pay attention a little bit but they are not really a d d and the parents are taking them in and going johnnie is not getting straight a is put him on something <LAUGH> <LAUGH> so i guess 

Recording: (6267/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (6268/ 9621) 
i like it um i have lived i have only lived in the northern end i have lived in dublin and old worthington and now hilliard which is kind of around the side um but i like it because it has it is own little well especially worthington it is own little city within a city 

Recording: (6269/ 9621) 
twenty years ago 

Recording: (6270/ 9621)

Recording: (6277/ 9621) 
i wonder if that is also socialized medicine there it is socialized is not it 

Recording: (6278/ 9621) 
which was a a going thing 

Recording: (6279/ 9621) 
um i have a class at um high school that it is called grads and it is like um you know all the kids in there are people that have kids 

Recording: (6280/ 9621) 
i have got nothing against christianity but i got something against the way it was brought here 

Recording: (6281/ 9621) 
yeah exactly 

Recording: (6282/ 9621) 
well they needed to strike do not get me wrong that is not the stupid part but the part was uh a majority of them saying that they were here for ten years and ai not making that much money most people would move on 

Recording: (6283/ 9621) 
yeah well the white man would probably win but the black man also has a he has a better chance than the woman i think 

Recording: (6284/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6285/ 9621) 
i am 

Recording: (6286/ 9621) 
you know what um actually i do not believe they have anything booked so far lot of times i think this year people are more going out rather than having people come in to their homes and things i have usually i have worked for different hotels where i have always worked on new year is eve and my husband this year is like you know but we do not even have any plans we were gonna maybe do something with some friends and they are going to california so i am not sure even exactly what i am gonna do but um right now there is not an event scheduled 

Recording: (6287/ 9621) 
no not really i mean different cultures and everything uh but i i went to school with blacks so i mean that was not that big a thing except for the influx of the you know i did not realize how many were being drafted or being enlisting into the service at the time and everything or how many actually were even in the in the country you know 

Recording: (6288/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6289/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6290/ 9621) 
and i mean yeah if they find the cause of it whatever you know that is good but at the same time it the cause of it does not really matter i mean the fact of matter is it is there they have to deal with it so 

Recording: (6291/ 9621) 
um media has a lot of control over people but i believe that sometimes people just need a kick like that 

Recording: (6292/ 9621) 
they did 

Recording: (6293/ 9621) 
see the thing is ideally i would rather if i were gonna buy house in clintonville to hold them and rent them my problem is i do not have any money so i that down payment has to be ten percent down and so that means that i would have that tied up while it was being rented like we bought a couple condos over on bethel road it is for my kids to live in so that my oldest girl when she is getting ready to move out she is like twenty four and they could not find any place to live that i thought was that that i felt was safe and that was acceptable so i finally decided well we will find something and i will buy and i will be your land lady and then what will it will be nice and so i bought that one and then my other daughter wanted to was thinking she was gonna move out when she graduated from high school and changed her mind so i just rented that one but it the bottom line is i i just got a second mortgage and i have a guy that i work with that helped me buy those without any money i did not have a down payment i had nothing so so it is like i can afford to hang on to those because the rent just makes the payment but the other you would you would be fine you be renting it you would not buy anything that you did not think you could rent and come out even with 

Recording: (6294/ 9621) 
you know i just got out of it 

Recording: (6295/ 9621) 
yeah and and immigration from different countries and those people come in and they have got their input and i think that it is just a mixture of everything 

Recording: (6296/ 9621) 
and do not insult us any more or we will go to trial um so my attorney jumped it back up to a hundred and twenty five thousand dollar i could not take sitting there these guys going back and forth and what they thought i was worth even the arbitrator was an asshole um but uh that is the way that system works 

Recording: (6297/ 9621)

Recording: (6298/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6299/ 9621)

Recording: (6300/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah i am just learning the area so but i like it so far it seems really nice and uh ah it seems like there is a lot more to do in columbus obviously but 

Recording: (6301/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (6302/ 9621) 
does not even 

Recording: (6303/ 9621)

Recording: (6308/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> i seen this a thousand times now people fighting killing this murder that murder it is like the same thing over and over and over we just keep repeating and repeating our bad stuff instead of getting off of it 

Recording: (6309/ 9621) 
thirty nine 

Recording: (6310/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6311/ 9621)

Recording: (6312/ 9621) 
i mean he was a funny guy he was a really nice guy but it took him a while to catch on to things 

Recording: (6313/ 9621) 
i remember it being it is a pretty positive thing for me i was never upset about the fact that they were not together because they all both gave me a lot of attention but um about i think i was maybe five or six my mom moved into apartment in german village 

Recording: (6314/ 9621) 
like i do not know it is like it is it is really serious and it is really not serious like it is it is everything i guess 

Recording: (6315/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (6316/ 9621) 
um so i think that part definitely helps whereas most of my other friends you know they are kind of lost they do not know exactly what they are doing um where like said i have already done all the stuff that we are doing now and know how to go about it and 

Recording: (6317/ 9621) 
oh that is good that is good 

Recording: (6318/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (6319/ 9621) 
yeah i have a brother and two sisters 

Recording: (6320/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (6321/ 9621) 
all by herself 

Recording: (6322/ 9621) 
a little bit faster uh but and then in then when i get out of service like at twenty two you know i was kind of like behind everybody you know as far as my age group and stuff that did not have to go and uh so i had had a lot of uh good times as far as that goes and you know cleanliness and next to godliness and all that stuff you know i mean a lot of people do not there is just a lot of lax stuff goes on today in my opinion but 

Recording: (6323/ 9621) 
like you mean sexual relationships and what um probably the the bad things about it yeah um but just coming from my christian beliefs and what not the best thing and i know it even though i did not partake in it when i was a teenager and i was not promiscuous at all but i still had sex before marriage um just to be it would be nice if they teach you how to be confident in your self and i do not mean like self esteem but you know like we said if if uh you know you come from a situation like that that does not mean you have to be like that do you know what i mean kind of 

Recording: (6324/ 9621) 
and uh i said our our engineers they are not engineers per se but they are techies that are really in to this they they enjoy their work and it is for it is in the forefront of ohio government along with the technology there has to also be the paperwork now i know realize we have a paperless environment quote unquote 

Recording: (6325/ 9621) 
um i was in more north florida around tallahassee so that is a that is a little different i mean that is that is not that is more southern georgia basically um i do not know i mean yeah it is not so touristy and they had they had the thing where you could not have any buildings bigger than the state capital because they did not want it to be like orlando or miami like miami especially so that was really interesting it was a different type of town like not not so many palm trees more big oak trees and stuff like that yeah it is real it is more not all of a centralized downtown it is more of a like spreading out 

Recording: (6326/ 9621) 
even my mother who is a she said if nixon were running today she would vote for him she is that much of a conservative uh agrees with what is happened but most people will say the same thing there should have been another way to get him out of there but at this point i do not think there really was a a few months ago yeah but 

Recording: (6327/ 9621) 
i am not sure i do not know his his dad found it and told me about it because i was not working at the time and we were trying to get an extra income to come in and um his dad made actually like twenty five dollars or something you know i would think he would make more than that because man every time we go over there he is up on the computer doing something so and i am on there you know just i look up baby stuff get coupons and stuff um you know like reading about things that happen to people like their kids spitting up in their face or something 

Recording: (6328/ 9621) 
and would not you like them to see that you know look 

Recording: (6329/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6330/ 9621) 
i do not know i saw in the paper some kid was suspended because he had a paper he drew a picture of a gun and cut it out 

Recording: (6331/ 9621) 
it is just out of your control and i mean like i said i mean that is sort of kids for you i mean they just obviously they are gonna be curious about things and the parent definitely does have to be held responsible for it but i do not know to what degree that they should go with it 

Recording: (6332/ 9621) 
i mean if i would have chosen to do that well it is my choice oh god my husband is a lot better at these type of questions cause he was methodist and he chose to turn catholic when we got married and his perception of the methodist religion and the catholic religion and the more i was exposed to his it is like boy these really are similar but yours is a lot looser then mine and <LAUGH> just teaching him to be honest and open and being able to talk about sex and drugs and uh being there and open and keeping the lines of communication open and and then it goes back to the family being available and doing meaningful things with the children 

Recording: (6333/ 9621) 
um-hum okay 

Recording: (6334/ 9621) 
you can not see it in a day 

Recording: (6335/ 9621) 
or anything like that i do smack his hands 

Recording: (6336/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6337/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6338/ 9621) 
yeah but you put up with that anywhere it is not just ohio state it would be anywhere you go you know it is just like i said you get excuse me your assholes in 

Recording: (6339/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (6340/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (6341/ 9621) 
i do not know about that yeah he has not shown that period yet i do not know if he is supposed to be showing it now or not because um i mean when he goes to his aunt amy is you know it is bye mom you know <LAUGH> look up okay bye <LAUGH> that is it 

Recording: (6342/ 9621) 
she is doing all right as far as i know she is going to saint louis university do not ask me why but 

Recording: (6343/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> but um um one time i read somewhere that a mexican lady who came across the border to have her baby and they put the little band on and they wrote female and then they wrote her last name she said to her husband when he came over to see her well they have already named her look femalee 

Recording: (6344/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (6345/ 9621) 
well unfortunately i do not think it is fair but i think in the long run it does not have to be a college education because most of those people probably would not want a college education um but like a trade or a skill or something it will give them a little bit of hope if they do wanna choose to get a job instead of robbing a bank or selling drugs or whatever they did they have that choice it is it is it is up in their head okay i can either go become a welder or i can have a gun um i mean if they want a college education um yeah it is it is not fair but uh for for you growing up and going into a lifestyle i would prefer having their colleges paid for and then being productive citizens than somebody robbing me someday because they did not get an education i mean now that is a broad spectrum and i know it is not all that cut and dried um yeah it would upset me but hopefully i would step back from it a little bit and go well maybe it is for the best yeah 

Recording: (6346/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6347/ 9621) 
uh well take for one thing when i was overseas if we wanted to do something we would wait till sergeant went the shed and we would just put a padlock on the door so he could not get out 

Recording: (6348/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (6349/ 9621) 
um-hum um-hum 

Recording: (6350/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah yeah it is been glamorized and they do not they do not value human life either i do not think because there is so much violence you know you can not watch tv and not seeing somebody get shot or something and it is just like it is not really real because it is you know you turn the channel and you see the same actor doing something else and you are like see it was not real and i do not think they i think i do not know 

Recording: (6351/ 9621) 
yeah and it it has the least amount of people which is kind of neat as far as tourism so 

Recording: (6352/ 9621) 
yeah they like they really like this town she was from kentucky appalachia

Recording: (6357/ 9621) 
no not really i mean i would have preferred it of course and i would prefer that she carried on the faith the same as the rest of the children did but no i am i am very happy and content with her decision yeah very much so in as a matter of fact ironically julie the tulsan she and her husband both baptists they have both their children in a catholic prep school and yeah kindergarten and preschool and it is a yes it is it is a catholic school environment so it will be interesting to see what evolves from the children is uh attention to the the roman catholic side of religion as compared to the baptist so 

Recording: (6358/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> yeah 

Recording: (6359/ 9621) 
oh wow 

Recording: (6360/ 9621)

Recording: (6362/ 9621) 
i really hate that um and like affirmative action stuff totally burns me up the idea is wonderful but it is it is just executed very poorly i mean i saw like during high school how easy it was for me to get in to places i mean the citadel was begging me to come 

Recording: (6363/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (6364/ 9621)

Recording: (6369/ 9621) 
oh that was probably awesome 

Recording: (6370/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (6371/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6372/ 9621) 
just different stuff it is different every day that is why i like it just like you talking to people it is different every day 

Recording: (6373/ 9621) 
that is pretty extreme 

Recording: (6374/ 9621) 
but it fixed it 

Recording: (6375/ 9621) 
figures 

Recording: (6376/ 9621) 
it is available it is just whether they go and put forth the effort so 

Recording: (6377/ 9621) 
and so uh soon as my shop found out that i could draw that whole ninety dollars a month 

Recording: (6378/ 9621) 
was it hard 

Recording: (6379/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6380/ 9621) 
i was born in new york 

Recording: (6381/ 9621) 
and i am saying i could take that route but it it would cost me a lot of money that i do not have to get the legal defense and it be just best for me to take the responsibility like i have and i sold the car that i had to my sister uh i am going to pay back the apartment complex that i signed a lease for uh but i am gonna make them come after me YKNOW I MEAN UH uh i already went to court once and and uh well i even even with the evidence being in my favor i mean i was only at this place three months i did not do any damage to it um and the walls did not need painted i was not there long enough to make them dirty uh but um their own person even went through on a first run through after i moved out and my mother and i cleaned that thing spotless top bottom bathrooms and washed the floors and mopped the floors and everything and uh their own person came through an said it rated the paint an a which meant according to their system a meant no 

Recording: (6382/ 9621) 
those are the formative years of a child 

Recording: (6383/ 9621) 
i think it has changed drastically and i think it is changing and i think it will also be changing in the future uh going all the way back uh finances uh were were not a consideration in the in oh i would say probably my first thirty maybe even forty years there was some there was influence but i think the influence was not financial it was influence from the person who could get up here and talk with a group of people and sway them with his and i want to use the word opinion but i know that is not right it he swayed them with a position that he had developed now that is not necessarily his opinion so i am trying to make a point there <LAUGH> BUT he would sway them based upon the influences that he had had uh uh various people within his community or whether whether you are talking about a township or a county state whatever it may be and yes uh uh then slowly then i think the finances came into play and finances have come to a horrible horrible situation as of today and i will leave out this the last two years it because it is because it is rather specific right now but uh going back to two years or four years ago finances were still a very very heavy consideration and not not just on the uh national level but i am seeing it even on local levels i know within the immediate community there are people out there uh hey come on we will go to dinner we will go do this and we will do this and do this just uh just barely barely breaking uh the barrier but not breaking the law uh so yes very definitely progressively has changed 

Recording: (6384/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6385/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (6386/ 9621) 
i i do not think anyone really affected anyone too much as far as that goes 

Recording: (6387/ 9621) 
in a strange city i oh my god 

Recording: (6388/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (6389/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6390/ 9621) 
oh yeah oh yeah used to be when i first started teaching even up to sixth grade kids were pretty respectful 

Recording: (6391/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (6392/ 9621) 
yeah they are ok they are parents they are in their seventies now <LAUGH> i i take what i need and leave the rest because they have got their own opinions that are a lot different than mine so 

Recording: (6393/ 9621) 
you know they do not understand the concept so they do not know any different of you know why did not we get to stay home they may later when they grow older but yeah but i still think you know they benefited a lot from it now 

Recording: (6394/ 9621) 
i ever would have before 

Recording: (6395/ 9621) 
you know and what is the point of staying married and being miserable i think it is better to get a divorce than 

Recording: (6396/ 9621) 
family experiences 

Recording: (6397/ 9621) 
yeah i mean i want to see how the season ends out it is just a lot of the one is this season to me have just been disappointing the i mean i think every show sort of has a peak some shows peak towards the end some at the beginning and sort of level off i mean the the simpsons had a stretch from like their third year through like their seventh where things were just like unbelievably funny and then they had some writing changes i think and this this season is just it is been completely outrageous story lines and like the jokes are not as integrated into the story 

Recording: (6398/ 9621) 
like uh at a girl friend is of mine 

Recording: (6399/ 9621) 
well they are now in a sense uh it is easier to to go somewhere else i think on the web on tv if you have you know like four news four local news channels and they are all saying the same thing and emphasizing the same things there is no choice there if you want the news you are gonna get it one way or the other but on the web you can go somewhere else uh and you know major newspapers are all over the web uh you can pick and choose and you can see different perspectives on the same story from different parts of the country and i think you get a a wider view yeah 

Recording: (6400/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6401/ 9621) 
right <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6402/ 9621) 
years ago there was a i do not know if you were what your background is where you were here but or not but citizen journal was a daily paper and it was it was the opposite of the dispatch was much more liberal they used this and it it was a morning paper and the dispatch is an afternoon paper evening paper and uh they shared the same facilities the same printing presses and everything and then dispatch when their lease expired would not renew their lease 

Recording: (6403/ 9621)

Recording: (6407/ 9621) 
i do not i do not think they should i do not have any i do not you know if people are gay or you know that is their business but i do not think they that is not that is not how this world was they was not put you know it was a man and a woman <LAUGH> to start out with i do not i do not think um they should encourage that you know maybe that is a hard um topic to for me to talk about because i am i do not know because i am sure there are gay boys that are not knowing what is going on with themselves that are in school and and i i have never really understood i do not i never really understood if they were born like that or i i have just never really understood that to tell you truth <LAUGH> so i would not you know i would just i if i was a teacher i would just talk to talk to them and you know tell them to do whatever they feel i mean if they feel comfortable with being like that that is fine but i do not know i i do not know if i would talk about the but maybe they should because there might be kids in school that are like that and they are like well what should i do <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6408/ 9621)

Recording: (6418/ 9621) 
and that the the the people who whom most face that lie are the supposed beneficiaries of civil rights legislation um so what i mean civil rights was an an important step but once that step was made it was stopped and now i believe today there are uh i mean it i see a a growing movement of people who want to who curtail the advances that were made in the sixties and it is not our generation who is curtailing it it is still the uh like our parents generation um

not specifically no uh sometimes um little groups of sometimes you if there was a college in a community when i was running a school levy campaign um we would try to get them either registered and and active in a campaign um but it was very difficult it is sort of like getting people who live in a trailer park active in voting you know there are certain little blocks of people uh and on school levies the people who voted no which were senior citizens i mean they they went to the polls in droves you did not hafta you know the the the the hope there was that they would not go to vote <LAUGH> on the school levy uh but actually trying to get college kids involved i have not really specifically done that as a whole campaign in and of itself it might be a little pocket of a campaign but nothing big 

Recording: (6436/ 9621)

Recording: (6515/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6516/ 9621) 
oh okay okay it is part of growing up and i i have been there done that too but still you have to you have to um know there is respect out there to be warranted and you expect it and not just demand it you got to you have to work to show respect and then you should get respect for it but then they saw the interaction with the elderly people the school he went to a lot of public involvement public service required the teachers i often ask the teachers i have gone to sporting events and their teachers are there ticket takers uh monitoring the crowd wherever the kids i ask them i said do you guys ever go home said no oh yeah i said but they are always there they are not there just teaching a class they are not there preparing the class they are there after the class they are there for the student and they make the student feel part of the family that is a continuation of my philosophy at home we interact the school is great you have people that are on the clock oh time to quit they are gone those people do not know meaning of life they will never know the meaning of life but if they stay around try to extend themselves little more with somebody that is having problems at work and are willing to work with that person i did not say willing to work not knowing they are going to be compensated because they will be compensated not necessarily materialistically they will be then more than they are expected they will be recompensated somewhere but the thing is to lend an open hand not knowing well gee what is for what is in it for me what is in it for you is uh intangible are you willing 

Recording: (6517/ 9621)

Recording: (6644/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6645/ 9621) 
or um like the art shows in worthington or the crafts or even the the irish festival in dublin which can be free yeah on certain days and things like that um the concerts on the river or on the worthington green really anything like that 

Recording: (6646/ 9621) 
if they hold you know enough of my views i am not gonna vote for a woman just because they are a woman and i am not gonna vote for a democrat just because they are a democrat they better have uh you know at least and and i do not need a hundred percent uh so that a agreement with my views but i would like they would be at in the ninety to ninety five percent range um but yeah uh i will uh i do not tend to vote straight party line either as i said i have i have moderated from when i was uh in college to today part of the the aging process and also partly because i have i have noticed that to get things done you hafta have a center and it is the center that tends to rule when i was in college um we had a bumper sticker that said america fix it or forget it and some of the construction people in dayton came out with one that said america love it or leave it uh and today i realize that both of those positions are wrong it is america love it and fix it just like with your kids you love your kids but you do not let them you know have bad manners at the table and you do not let them run around with the wrong you know kids and you want them to behave well you know that is how i see america now and and america is become more centrist uh and when it deviates from that either way that is when people become upset um so i just think it is important and i i remember when um who was the other president that i voted for that won carter uh black leaders would meet with him once a week and then they would come out and hold this press conference and complain about he did not do this for blacks and he did not do enough for blacks he did not do this and he did not do that and i used to say to some my black friends do not you see what you are doing do not you see that greater implications of this oh no we need to have him move faster i said you know that would be great in an ideal world this is not an ideal world you hafta take it a step at a time whether you like it or not i said what you are gonna do is you are gonna make it look like he is so bad in all the issues you are gonna give people a reason to vote against him then if any big issue comes up that is just gonna be added to everything else i said what you need to do is after you have this meeting with him is come out and praise him and that he is doing a good job and that we are moving along steadily uh and i you know i do not think sometimes people who do politics of the negative understand what it means um i made that mistake when i was president the dayton education association we were trying to get a levy passed so we went around as teachers showing all of the bad conditions in the school all the leaking you know uh ceilings all of the peeling floors all the the bad chalk boards with cracks in them and all that kind of stuff and it had the opposite effect of what we thought people thought the schools were so bad they said we are not gonna support those and they voted no so the next time we did an opposite track we went in and we said you know um the eighteen months later when the board put um uh levy on the the ballot we said these are great schools we have great teachers look at this kid he is learning to read he is made six months improvement in three months and all that kind it was image and it we were saying the same thing you know we want to continue this we want to make even this better um we learned to say the negatives in a positive way and that is important you know and and you need to get that that you need to appeal to the center american is do not like extreme liberals they do not like extreme conservatives you know they want they want peace <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6647/ 9621) 
oh gosh 

Recording: (6648/ 9621) 
and union is not gonna do that 

Recording: (6649/ 9621)

Recording: (6659/ 9621) 
well think a little bit safer idea than uh eliminating guns because you know there is always gonna be weapons out there instead of eliminating the problem you know more centralize it make it a national law that you hafta be a certain age give a certain time period for your background checks and whatever else kind of record finding they need make sure you are you know not gonna just go out and blow somebody is head off for no reason you are keeping it for you know just either security reasons hunting reasons or practice you know but

Recording: (6681/ 9621)

Recording: (6697/ 9621) 
and it is not fair to her or the other people

Recording: (6707/ 9621) 
where as i do not know lutheran is a little bit more open to 

Recording: (6708/ 9621)

Recording: (6709/ 9621) 
you you are you are intelligent you know

they they it is just set up uh on a flat bed truck on wall street in new york and do a concert there <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6718/ 9621) 
when they drove by i guess 

Recording: (6719/ 9621) 
compared to you you will have more loyalty i would think and at the same time those people will not be thinking about being hungry while they are on the line working for you 

Recording: (6720/ 9621) 
um-hum but you know when he first came here he said that you could not win here because he had too many slow white guys so 

Recording: (6721/ 9621) 
uh six five years ago almost five years ago couple months short of that oh YEAH <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6722/ 9621) 
so she did i do not know whether it was more than a year or not for i think it was forty dollars a month and uh course that was forty dollars more than they had otherwise and uh then i think the let us see she well she went out there when bernice was going to school and bernice went to my oldest sister went to know whether it is first or maybe second grade out there says she she really thought that mom was the best teacher she ever HAD IN GRADE SCHOOL uh then they hired a girl to come in as a hired girl and uh about the second or third day she was there she was not was not feeling very good 

Recording: (6723/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6724/ 9621) 
um-hum um-hum 

Recording: (6725/ 9621) 
if i would grown up with them maybe they would have that thing going on that my sister has which is a bunch of shared mutual experiences but as it stands they are just weird 

Recording: (6726/ 9621) 
yeah make their job earlier and faster uh ya know and libraries like so many other places especially at universities or they have seen budget problems and the subscriptions for periodicals are just outrageous 

Recording: (6727/ 9621) 
and the administrators for telecommunications for the state of ohio are working with us as observers because they do not have a staff 

Recording: (6728/ 9621) 
i was born in brooklyn new york 

Recording: (6729/ 9621) 
no they do not actually 

Recording: (6730/ 9621) 
and you uh it is just like the game battleship pretty much you know a four a two a seven and um well off a three dollar one i have won probably four out of five you know in that i have not bought that many of them but in that race right there four out of fives not too bad got my mom one on her birthday she got fifteen dollars and the other times i get them i either win my three dollars back or i won nine dollars hm 

Recording: (6731/ 9621) 
with people who want them 

Recording: (6732/ 9621) 
yeah it has not it has not gone far as loan sharking but you know the the thing of it is it is fun when you win and it is still fun when you lose i mean you know just 

Recording: (6733/ 9621) 
and just ya know sort of doing the same old same old everyday there it was always something different i have to be outside and it was just a lot easier to do 

Recording: (6734/ 9621) 
it is more our society than the guns i believe it is more the person that would have the gun than the gun itself 

Recording: (6735/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6736/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (6737/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (6738/ 9621) 
um i i i when i was growing up i had i had a whole litter of cats 

Recording: (6739/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6740/ 9621) 
if not you just get the the regular rooms are still nice and they have showers and stuff but it is interesting because the way they advertise it they make it sound like there is this huge place and you are gonna get that no matter what and this and that but when you actually go and look around it kind of 

Recording: (6741/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6742/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6743/ 9621) 
yeah and yeah and i would not do that i if i was you know had no children and 

Recording: (6744/ 9621) 
so you know um it it is pretty pretty busy there but it it is spread out over the sixteen hours is where as port columbus sometimes you have like maybe seventy five eighty airplanes in an hours time so 

Recording: (6745/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6746/ 9621) 
and they are like wow let us do this too we can make school you know let out for a little bit i they might not be doing it to um 

Recording: (6747/ 9621) 
hum 

Recording: (6748/ 9621) 
boy i you know i i do not not having kids and then you know not being that close to it it is hard to know i mean i have always i have always thought that that um what their friends did and what they what they were exposed to at home had as much influence as as anything that that the school could do but i know the school school is a very powerful force in a kid is life you know i mean it is a kid is life 

Recording: (6749/ 9621) 
well it is kind of hard he see <LAUGH> he is got two other kids and one kid he had while we was together that he does not see at all 

Recording: (6750/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6751/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6752/ 9621) 
well how he felt and knowing that were not neglecting him were two different things we have always emphasized that knowing what is right or knowing that what is just is one thing it is dealing with the emotions is another one 

Recording: (6753/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6754/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah 

Recording: (6755/ 9621) 
no not at all i would have rather voted for mccain over bush because bush he he comes from a political family which i am not saying is wrong because the kennedys were a big political family but i am saying like bush is um he just seems like he did not really like everything is been handed to him in life and uh the issue of like whether he did drugs not that that is a big issue but i do not like the way he addressed it you know that to me just if you did drugs okay everyone might experiment or try or make a mistake but the way he is handling it saying i am not even gonna dignify that question over and over and over if he did not do it he might as well just be like no i did not do it 

Recording: (6756/ 9621) 
no <LAUGH> actually i was uh going to get my g e d after that 

Recording: (6757/ 9621) 
yeah with all the controversy about that and polaris and um-hum um i do not know it is northland is such a a good location for all the people around there and it is certainly not you know um um a hurting or you know a neighborhood that people do not need the shopping so i did not see the difference of having both there is lazarus everywhere there is sears everywhere why not have it both places i mean i would not particularly go up to polaris if they take northland but we are not planning on staying there anyway so i did not yeah we will probably move within the year um-hum 

Recording: (6758/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (6759/ 9621) 
um-hum which meant she would never get the nomination because of who controls the republican party 

Recording: (6760/ 9621) 
we are still working those PROBLEMS <LAUGH> yeah 

Recording: (6761/ 9621) 
again gets back to being in the home did your mother give you everything you wanted then she failed you did not she 

Recording: (6762/ 9621) 
and of course i think too as in america the um the farm families you know they wanted that was more laborers for the vineyards so to speak so i think that might have influenced a lot of that but over the years it it um it just made sense to me in fact it looks like in my family that they are going the children are going to be mostly in twos you know not even going to three or four i mean not over yet but my girls are forty two and forty one soon to be forty one so um i think that their child bearing years are over 

Recording: (6763/ 9621) 
i know i wish i knew how to sew <LAUGH> i can do buttons that is about it <LAUGH> um-hum 

Recording: (6764/ 9621)

attention deficit hyperactive disorder 

Recording: (6767/ 9621) 
no there is a lot of people go to church that are not worth anything too you know so i do not really believe that going to church you know uh uh makes you a better human being than another human being i believe that the you know your i believe that most people with basic uh structure in their life if it is based similar to the bible or you could say buddhism or whatever you know uh uh that you will tend to have a better life than you will if you practice non quote unquote religious religious ways but i do not believe somebody going to church makes them a better human being than the next person uh becausethere is a lot of hypocrites that go to church now these kids i i think more just more than anything else i mean one thing i i remember hearing it a lot about too was they they were picked on 

Recording: (6768/ 9621) 
and uh that is when i lost my job after that and things got difficult more and more difficult um was unable to work full time i am doing some part time work right now working with people with mental illness um but it is you know the the thing i am running into out there is that uh nobody wants to pay you to do anything <LAUGH> uh i do not understand that but uh and then the when they do want you to do something they abuse the hell out of you you know they give you a pager a cell phone and they want to know where you are morning noon and night seven days a week and that is none of their business um so i the frustrations with trying to find an adequate job and an adequate employer that understands my situation and and how i operate and will give me freedom to do what i can do i have a bachelor of arts in communications but it is been more of a problem than it is been a asset um interviewing for jobs people that uh were doing the interviewing had just a high school education and uh they are not gonna hire me when after a year i would be their boss <LAUGH> um so a lot of that is out there uh regardless of what people say i am not trying to be pessimistic or negative it is just been my experience uh unfortunately um i hope it gets better but uh like i said i have not been ever uh told that my degree matters by any employer uh contrary to what the news tells you and what people will tell you oh go get that college degree uh you know uh people told me soon as i got out of college then i needed a masters and then they said and after you get your masters you will definitely need your doctorate well you know the people saying this are college people the college is a business uh and it takes awhile to REALIZE THAT if you can get in and get that education on grant money and scholarships that is that is good but then even now being a person with a somewhat disability from a brain injury um i mean i do not even like to call it disability and i have uh different abilities now you know same abilities i used to do but i have to do them a different way um just because my brain functions on a different level and i can not explain that to anybody and i should not have to but i am always forced to um but uh trying to find a job you know uh resulting from this has been difficult and uh and that is uh you know i am not giving up hope or nothing like that i am just trying to trying to cut through and see what i can do and uh you know there is just ah um um it is very limited out there you know and your education is is an asset but like i said even as a person uh now going through b v r um i am discriminated against in my opinion because i have a bachelors in other words uh bureau of vocational rehabilitation which is government funded organization geared toward helping people with disabilities get back to work and um because i already have a bachelors they will not pay for school now if i were stupid you know if i just had a basic just got out of grade school and did not even have my g e d boy they would pay for my high school my college and everything you know even living expenses you know but because i have a bachelors nothing you know

Recording: (6917/ 9621) 
yeah like it will be under something real weird or like multimedia or something like that you know it is like i do not know who who how they it designed that way 

Recording: (6918/ 9621) 
makes it difficult it is an adjustment 

Recording: (6919/ 9621) 
yeah most of them do you know and then you know pretty much the rest of them just hang out <LAUGH> go to school 

Recording: (6920/ 9621) 
see that is how my husband was they did not have a pet growing up 

Recording: (6921/ 9621) 
well i know with myself when we had pete always says that it was not for me he would have gotten just too immersed in his job because he is really involved you know he likes what he is doing he has tremendous responsibility and but he loves it but the thing is when the were little too you know i was always having to pull him back and say do not forget you know they are gonna grow up fast if you if you do not spend this time and now i mean like i said the youngest is thirteen and so he is been at this for all these years and i do not have to do that anymore i mean someplace along the way about ten years ago he got so involved in their lives but when they are little 

Recording: (6922/ 9621) 
let us see usually go out to lunch at like some fast food place and then we get together and cook dinner 

Recording: (6923/ 9621) 
so we lower the standards to meet that 

Recording: (6924/ 9621) 
as sheepherders and uh they were not VERY desirable specimens other than for herding sheep and we would come in dirty when mom was the uh dirty as an old sheepherder <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6925/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6926/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (6927/ 9621) 
you know you know do i feel safe is this a place i can go is there somebody who always takes care of me and and i think left to their own devices 

Recording: (6928/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6929/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah because they think they are grown they think they are grown and they are like twelve and thirteen and they have been having sex since they were ten and it is just like GOSH and you know how and they are having babies earlier and earlier and it is just really scary 

Recording: (6930/ 9621) 
right i have a neighbor that is that way 

Recording: (6931/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (6932/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6933/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> RIGHT well not just one my older brother would have been two and a half or three <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6934/ 9621)

Recording: (6935/ 9621) 
cosi is going to be opening up on the sixth um looking forward to doing that we had a um uh seasons pass to wyandotte lake spent a lot of time at the pools um different swim centers hunter different rec centers the y programs are excellent even here at ohio state they have got the um um recreational sports on sunday afternoons where they can go um we go to the zoo a lot libraries have story times reading hours those type of things um just all kind of community things easter egg hunts at the rec centers 

Recording: (6936/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (6937/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6938/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (6939/ 9621) 
i think so 

Recording: (6940/ 9621) 
disciplined i would be screamed at made get jumped on the floor to do pushups i mean it was it was 

Recording: (6941/ 9621) 
i would do anything but touch the computer and sometimes it is like six and seven hours a day at the computer and i just do not wanna do it 

Recording: (6942/ 9621) 
retire yeah 

Recording: (6943/ 9621) 
that was all i knew 

Recording: (6944/ 9621) 
that is exactly how i am when you said what would i do you know i might do house i might do go to school some i used to own a gallery i might do something like that again you know there is just like there is just zillions of projects out there waiting to happen and so it is just 

Recording: (6945/ 9621) 
it is just the the spiritual aspect there is the realm even einstein the most <vocnoised> brilliant man supposedly mathematically of our time ah even said that there will be people or should be people come along with better theories than he has yet but nobody has taken the time or made the time to challenge his theory 

Recording: (6946/ 9621) 
that would probably affect my decision a little bit 

Recording: (6947/ 9621) 
yeah they are going it is spring break couple of teachers are taking a bunch of kids 

Recording: (6948/ 9621) 
uh goes on uh you you know nationally you know especially interested in this presidential election 

Recording: (6949/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6950/ 9621) 
do not you think 

Recording: (6951/ 9621) 
but then they have one injury and then what are they going to do and they got to think of that they have a free education and they just do not think of it that way you know they think they can make enough money but you know 

Recording: (6952/ 9621) 
and also at the show of hands galleries and 

Recording: (6953/ 9621) 
they 

Recording: (6954/ 9621) 
yeah i wish they would clean it up more often no it is not sprawling out from where i am <LAUGH> i do not live in the suburbia area so i mean i live i live right in the middle of all the houses that have been there for sixty or seventy years and i am smack dab in the middle of all the frats and sororities on campus so i am on nah that is fine spreads out fine i just think it is funny i i would love to get a good nice overhead view of columbus because you probably see the house after house after house um you know like they did right in the right in the um fifties uh i can not remember what it is called like where every single house is a mirror image of the one right beside it and you get all these streets that are in the exact same pattern all you know like for like miles and miles and miles but um no i think it is cool that they are all spreading out oh yeah one thing they could really do with columbus that i have noticed are i would say lack of noticed in any other city in the united states why in the world do they hafta work on all the roads all at the same time i do not understand they hafta to they are working on three fifteen two seventy seventy seventy one six seventy all at the same time why why i do not understand it yeah apparently not not really <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6955/ 9621) 
um-hum i was stationed uh permanent duty station was in north carolina 

Recording: (6956/ 9621) 
yeah he they could afford to go there so they did 

Recording: (6957/ 9621) 
and they 

Recording: (6958/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6959/ 9621) 
okay yeah sure <LAUGH> no it is okay 

Recording: (6960/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (6961/ 9621) 
i could fire them because they are gay i could care less 

Recording: (6962/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (6963/ 9621) 
so however this works out you know i do not know i am just i am just like okay she just does i just want to get it over with and see now she you know 

Recording: (6964/ 9621) 
well her major is communications it did not start out that but my daughter wants to write books okay well <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6965/ 9621) 
no i am living yeah that is my my um role call 

Recording: (6966/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (6967/ 9621) 
her and her mother went and seen it and everything we were divorced at the time and uh then i went and bought the movie and 

Recording: (6968/ 9621) 
and then how satisfying is that to them when you have a chance to talk to them that is where we need to learn more from interview have more meaningful interviews with these people so that we can learn from them they put me on spotlight but we somehow we just do not wanna uh i guess flood them with the we do not wanna get the negative answer because of all might hurt the image of the university oh gee ya know when we who was it katsenmoyer well hey we realize that the university only wants players who will draw gate money that is all they wanna do they are not here for academics they do not talk about academics when they are coming to ohio state 

Recording: (6969/ 9621) 
the teacher was there one day and she was pregnant with twins and the second day she was in the hospital those things happen 

Recording: (6970/ 9621) 
it was 

Recording: (6971/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (6972/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6973/ 9621) 
a lot of people switch from being like the really quiet more reserved people to the party animal 

Recording: (6974/ 9621) 
um i would tend to say most people i know are at least fairly ethical i mean THERES NO MORE sinister group than the other that i know 

Recording: (6975/ 9621) 
eventually 

Recording: (6976/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> he works he 

Recording: (6977/ 9621) 
um i think so i think partial birth is not such a big issue because i mean it hardly ever comes up but i with so many things it is it is like a it is a foot in the door if we can do that then we can say well you know maybe not in the third trimester and then we can say well not in the second trimester and 

Recording: (6978/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (6979/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6980/ 9621) 
i have almost been hit i do not know how many times people talking on telephones i see people turning with no turn signals 

Recording: (6981/ 9621) 
there is a web access to some of our systems when that is all we are putting a more uniform one up for everything and i do not it may be they o s u has some system but they can also connect to our system for things they do not have in their system and it is so i am not sure what system you are talking 

Recording: (6982/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (6983/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6984/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6985/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (6986/ 9621) 
yeah yeah yeah you can not ignore it i because you know because that is something else when i was in high school i do not think i knew the word but um now everybody knows anybody who is a little bit different is likely to be called a faggot <LAUGH> and and so it is better if you can diffuse that but i boy i would not know how to approach it i mean i think it should be approached but i would not have a clue 

Recording: (6987/ 9621) 
LIKE YEAH LIKE LIKE FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE IN A lecture hall yeah 

Recording: (6988/ 9621) 
um-hum um-hum yeah i can i am two thirty five 

Recording: (6989/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (6990/ 9621) 
the united states knows about it they sit there and they will pay the welfare they will not do nothing to him 

Recording: (6991/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> yeah right real war <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6992/ 9621) 
right and it is all the bucks yeah because people i work with you know uh there uh there are some people i work with that house payments one guy he has the biggest twenty two hundred dollars a month and a lot of them have like fifteen hundred and up and you know i bought my house years and years ago and it is like four eighty five and i would not dare tell them that but it is like you know they because they are always at you know there are people there that make a lot more money than i do and and they are always like broke but yet you know like when they go do something they have gotta have the best of everything the best of it is like you know you know you i to me you just hafta kind of think about things little bit and it is like you know do i do i really need to go to um oh what would i say um uh t g i fridays for lunch and spend twelve dollars can i go to taco bell and spend like three and use the other part for maybe like a book for my kid or you know uh they have like my daughter is in swimming i need the money for a swimsuit well why do not i use it for that you know so it is 

Recording: (6993/ 9621) 
because it is more open um and you couch it in terms of civil rights um my boyfriend is thinks it is wrong morally but does not think we ought to be discriminating against uh he he thinks it is a sin therefore he thinks they should repent and the way to do that is through you know talking to them religion wise um i do not think it is a sin i think that um your sexuality is genetic based and that i you can no more change your sexual orientation than you can the color of your eyes or your hair you may put a dye on it or you may put a different um whatever those eye pieces are contacts i do not wear glasses so i can never remember those terms um but that is just cosmetic and anyone who tries to change their sexual orientation that is cosmetic too uh and again my belief is whatever happens between consenting adults is their business not mine um so i do not know that anyone could change it what was your question again 

Recording: (6994/ 9621) 
um wander around look at things 

Recording: (6995/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6996/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6997/ 9621) 
well it is gotta come from the top you know i i just found like there was just a total lack of interest in the student from every direction so i would say you know it is an organizational problem with no you know no motivation uh you know to do their job you know properly now i live down the street from what they call cahs it is the columbus uh alternative high school and uh you get there through a lottery system and they have the best reputation of all the columbus schools and uh those kids leave there getting full scholarships uh my son went there one year uh uh it was a disaster for him 

Recording: (6998/ 9621) 
yeah they were pro strike were getting money on buck i d is but yeah 

Recording: (6999/ 9621) 
a bad one or a good one 

Recording: (7000/ 9621) 
so there is been a lot of pressure there 

Recording: (7001/ 9621) 
and uh a disease that affected her mind and of course you know back then i did not really know that but there was a lot of conflict 

Recording: (7002/ 9621) 
yeah it was yeah it was interesting 

Recording: (7003/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7004/ 9621) 
flipped me out 

Recording: (7005/ 9621) 
now how can you do that yeah 

Recording: (7006/ 9621) 
i mean i did not have the greatest childhood i do not think any of us ever really had the best you know but but i do not like i would not talk to my kid the way some of these people talk to them but um one today you know and she got on the bus and the little girl went and set over here she is probably about eight maybe six or something like that and she wanted to set here her mommy so she made her set with her which is cool and mommy just goes to sleep and the little kid is trying to study her homework you know for not that well i do not know was she up all night partying or was she up all night working you know or what the hell is is your problem 

Recording: (7007/ 9621) 
i do not really see anybody i was totally ready to vote for elizabeth dole and then she opened her mouth and things came out AND <LAUGH> uh she had the best chance out of any uh any woman that is ever run for president and she was in a major party which has not happened before and it would have been really funny to see what happened to bob dole over it <LAUGH> you know be the first man after having run for the office 

Recording: (7008/ 9621) 
but they but then in the very next breath they said well in two weeks we are going to california to visit paul now now and anyhow i was telling each of my children because i was upset and i was telling them this and they are all going oh mom my older girls are going oh you know and my my daughter who is thirteen is fabulous she is so blunt she is such she is just so out there and so different from so many other children um and she said well do you actually care if he comes here you do not care do you and i said well i do not care but it makes me feel bad it hurts my feelings 

Recording: (7009/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7010/ 9621) 
i personally do not believe that they should be allowed to because i believe they they should have the male gender as well as the female gender for a proper bringing up 

Recording: (7011/ 9621) 
you know i think a lot of it depends on i do not know if it is different parts of the country but cultures and everything because you know it just seems in ah some parts of the midwest but maybe kentucky and west virginia seems girls down there a lot them get married so young they just that is just what they want to do you know they do not but they are not thinking of any future wanting to go to college or anything like that have to cough is that okay i am sorry <LAUGH> i did not want be like 

Recording: (7012/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7013/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (7014/ 9621) 
absolutely 

Recording: (7015/ 9621) 
or something like that just for something to do 

Recording: (7016/ 9621) 
happened sometime um probably would have been my my freshman year in high school um we were just walking down high street and <LAUGH> i guess we were wrong place at the wrong time and some people were like yelling stuff and we could not make out what they were saying 

Recording: (7017/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (7018/ 9621) 
first grade the first grade teacher was aware of what he needed and but the principle would not let her give it to him to give him something had to do what everything anybody else in the class was doing he was even tutoring some of the kids in first grade and it the last grading period she would give him sh everyday she would give him a math paper to work on and he said i showed you i i know how to do this i am not doing it 

Recording: (7019/ 9621) 
just seems like a waste of legislation money 

Recording: (7020/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7021/ 9621) 
do you want to know where i was born 

Recording: (7022/ 9621) 
YEAH AND she is just like yeah the minute we walk in the door it is like you guys clock out <LAUGH> 

Recording: (7023/ 9621) 
um-hum <LAUGH> 

Recording: (7024/ 9621) 
as it was jacob is sold the northland mall anyway so it is probably gonna be like a a strip mall more or less 

Recording: (7025/ 9621) 
yeah she lives over by uh riverside hospital 

Recording: (7026/ 9621) 
to marry him and she moved over and 

Recording: (7027/ 9621) 
i mean as old as i am i still got that against him and that is what i would i want my you know my son to keep i want him to know his father and be around him even though he is not the best best of person but you know 

Recording: (7028/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (7029/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7030/ 9621) 
well see that is not proved out by the the approval ratings he still has higher approval rating than reagan had in his last eighteen months so you know people still like what he what he is done i think that that um that you know people do not like all the crap that went with him as the on tv you know they say that and they are they are still trying to get him i mean before he was even elected they were trying to get him which is what they would have done to elizabeth dole they would not have been able to attack on the issues so they would find other things to get get her on so they start bringing out all these women and all that stuff on and most people did not care about it they did not care about it before the election they did not care about it during his campaign they did not care about it during his presidency it was some republican right wing i do not know what who were just trying to make an issue out of nothing it was not watergate you know he may have been a cad you know he may have you know but she was twentyone it is not like it was someone who could not make up her own mind what she wanted to do you know and he may have been stupid and a cad uh but i do not wanna know about it on day one when it hit the the news i did not want to know about it and on the end when he was you know not impeached i did not wanna know about it and in between i did not wanna know about it and they just kept angering me because there were other things i wanted the government to do and this congress is the worst i have ever seen in not getting anything done and not really being able to be on the pulse of of where america is on such issues as gun control and women is rights and and things that are important to people you know they they have tried to make pseudo issues out of clinton and then they tried to make a pseudo issue out of you know giving a tax cut people do not want a tax cut when it is going to affect their social security or affect you know uh the the the deficit 

Recording: (7031/ 9621) 
yeah that yeah um-hum i think the mother has more of an instinct for that but as far as the studies go where the people roll over their babies i do not see how you can roll over on anything that size and not know it unless you were on drugs or drunk or whatever you know what i mean 

Recording: (7032/ 9621) 
um i would like to teach um mm the the field is particularly saturated right now so i am not holding out hopes for a teaching job i mean i would like to think that i could distinguish myself within the field and get a job but i mean right now those jobs simply are not available so uh i am approaching things like whatever happens happens i am gonna pursue my interests and then go on from there rather than necessarily thinking about career plans after i finish my schooling 

Recording: (7033/ 9621) 
that is awfully young but again he is got this baby yet they did not talk about how this baby how you make a baby or everything and i do not know if they should be talking about that yet but here he is with this baby and it is just like okay 

Recording: (7034/ 9621) 
they are dear 

Recording: (7035/ 9621) 
definitely i definitely the way i feel the death penalty is wrong but uh i do not know people are always like oh you know if your mother if your mother was killed god forbid but like you would want the death penalty but honestly i do not think i would i really like i would feel angry towards that person but killing them does not help me with my maybe the families say it helps with closure and everything but i that to me is it is displacing my anger in a way that actually i do not think the my victim that i was so close to me would want me to do you know so 

Recording: (7036/ 9621) 
and uh then while she was out there she met a a cowboy who was from also from ohio and uh they uh they were married while they were out there i guess but uh she was <LAUGH> uh my son used to say she was a piece of work she <LAUGH> she had not definite ideas about pretty near everything 

Recording: (7037/ 9621) 
oh boy i said and this and here i here i come from this is a gentlemen that is uh dark skin i do not know if he is black or colored i am still confused as to what difference in black and colored is but uh he says you know my brothers probably came to these islands to the to the continental they come down here and they are getting all they are swaying themselves they are acting cocky to me and so forth and i say we do not do that here and i said well i know this you know uh there is a lot of black population here creole mix and that type of thing which i would consider colored not black uh to me black is black if you have anything mixed in you it is colored uh but he said uh we do not do that uh he said problem in the states gosh you guys daddy wants kid wants a car get him a car down here child only comes from the school i uh i gave him a dinner but i ask him to sweep off the front porch now i will still give him his dinner but i ask him please did you do your sweep the front porch may not sound much but at least i am trying to teach him something and you you saw all that down there in the people where we were down fredericksburg but uh it it is it is just those things you you learn and and there is other times i was down in jamaica and you went back into the back country and you saw very impoverished uh area so i 

Recording: (7038/ 9621) 
um secretarial administrative assistant type work 

Recording: (7039/ 9621)

Recording: (7041/ 9621) 
yeah that was IT that is hard to believe when you hear all that and see all that again you are just like wow wait what were those people thinking um-hum yeah 

Recording: (7042/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7043/ 9621) 
YEAH 

Recording: (7044/ 9621) 
there has been some serious consideration but no uh there were some a lot someone took up a petition and was urging to do it but he is decided he did not want to devote that much time away from his uh his television program oh he he is quite a smart fellow really some of this conversation we have had here uh has been influenced within our family uh we have ministers we have doctors we have lawyers we have uh farmers we have uh POLITICIANS uh what else WE GOT IN THERE we have

um-hum 

Recording: (7050/ 9621) 
uh civil rights only went so far they have not corrected the wrongs of the past they have not uh created uh a a a sense in our society that anyone can achieve like the american dream in in my opinion is an absolute lie

Recording: (7054/ 9621)

Recording: (7081/ 9621) 
well when you think about the different generations and things we certainly did not have the things to worry about thatpeopledonow who knows in elementary and junior high and we would have never dreamed of anybody having good <noisegun> or even in let alone a knife i mean that and that is violence and that is that goes back to kids and how much time and and effort you put in to them you know kids are ignored and pushed aside and they are in the way and there is so many people that do not even want them and you know and then they get in to school and they get violent and they they take it out uh you know and everybody is surprised you know i am not because i know there is a lot of anger and a lot of hate for these little kids and um and going to school is getting to be so dangerous i think because you have so many of them in one little room and they are coming from so many different backgrounds and if you take each one of their situations i can bet the statistics as time goes on that they they are not gonna have one caring parent you know maybe not even one of the parents you know they might have a foster family or you know somebody that wants to pretend like they care you know there is a lot of the people that that are foster families that only want the money you know and and there is all that so it is it is really scary and i think i think that it had something has to be done real fastido notknowwhat i think it starts from what we teach them and as adults what we allow to be out there the computers i mean oh my gosh i did not even get a computer because i was so afraid of what they could be able to access there was not you know there was nothing barred at all when they first came out yeah and you know where are all those software people they are not responsible for y two k they are not responsible for you know all this internet access to all the stuff so it is really hard

people that just uh really wanna teach as opposed to like i do not know why other people wanna like even went into teaching at all you know but um i think that would help just making it more like not so impersonal not so this is you know you do this to get this certain grade it is like you do this to learn this because it is interesting as opposed to like and i do not know i think it is like there is a lot of things that it is more like compulsory education is weird like being forced to take this class like i think that if i uh but i mean it is good to being forced to take a like a liberal arts thing because like you do not know what you wanna do so it is like if like you hate math and you do not take it at all but then you decide you wanna do something in math then you are like screwed like can not go back 

Recording: (7121/ 9621) 
i do not know there that much detail but most time it comes down to a lack of uh knowing your your children how they are gonna react to certain things oh what it is uh i do not know details with thing other than the fact that they are seem like there is lot emptiness going on uh with them and uh and i think that is part of problem we have in our uh in our life i have uh i it would be very difficult um i think uh in our in traveling if you say okay i am gonna give up this life here and go to the third world and live or else do less less reverse bussing hey okay upper arlington you live northwest side why you down and live on the east side

Recording: (7188/ 9621) 
i 

Recording: (7189/ 9621) 
they think everything they say is hilarious oh it is just middle school i think it is transitioning from childhood to adulthood is a tough time and um when you have all the other things going on like you can not read and you can not write and you can not spell then it is just even worse it is exacerbated even more so i get the ones that everybody else throws out of their class 

Recording: (7190/ 9621) 
i think outside of the honors program a lot of it is but within the honors program i think there is some really really exceptional things going on 

Recording: (7191/ 9621)

Recording: (7198/ 9621)

Recording: (7199/ 9621)

Recording: (7202/ 9621) 
and he is very opinionated and it is interesting when he talks about uh anything he loves to talk about politics and social issues and that sort of thing uh you can tell that he is thought he is uh thought about it and his you know clearly formulated what his stance is on it and he is very articulate about it uh sometimes his responses are immature but he is nineteen 

Recording: (7203/ 9621) 
selling time for money yes 

Recording: (7204/ 9621) 
well it obviously i sort of surmounted that because i have been you know i spent a lot of time there since then i think had i only studied there for a semester or a quarter i would have come back with a completely different attitude but i was there for a whole year so the first few months were a little bit difficult but then you know after that you know you just sort of yeah get to the point where you are just kinda you know laugh it off and just think oh here we go again and then 

Recording: (7205/ 9621) 
some ideals ideas about it so i figure it is something i should know about so <LAUGH> 

Recording: (7206/ 9621) 
adoption is different i think though that when adoption is entirely different than when you can see but somebody else is sperm or somebody else is whatever uh because adoption means that i can not have any children or i see a child over here that needs help and here it is again you are reaching out to your friend your neighbor you are not just forgetting about him and let the welfare or somebody take care of him and let him go down the drain and i think that that is what adoption is and and you are really accepting this responsibility and that is love and when you are trying and willing to have well some people probably argue about this but i am sorry if god did not mean that i can conceive and have my own child why should i try to implant somebody else is inside of me and produce it i mean i would rather go out and see this other child that really needs help and adopt that baby because you can see them and you can help them and you are already aware to a certain extent of what genes they might have inherited and what problems you might be getting sometimes you do not <LAUGH> later on you will find out but it still you can go back and you can find the parent and i do not know whether they are gonna be able to trace these genes back and say you know later on if something happens to this child you are having and find out well what did they inherit over here but if you have adopted a child you can go back and you can find it out and help the child better 

Recording: (7207/ 9621)

Recording: (7211/ 9621) 
wow um i do not know if there could be there are certain programs different community based programs getting but again those are my values as i say steering the kids into a church based program if they can not be there putting them with um families and friends that you know and trust to to look after them giving them the guidance they need the ymca programs are wonderful they give them a structured activity to do where they are supervised but again those programs a lot of times cost money that the families do not have and it may not be their values to put them in those type of programs

my dad like 

Recording: (7219/ 9621) 
when in the fifties and sixties you very seldom saw black people on t v and then you start seeing a couple of black people on t v and then there was the jeffersons and although i found that jeffersons offensive in many ways because it was stereotypical and made fun of of of black people in many ways in retrospect it was trend setting and what it did in in even in putting blacks in um advertisements on t v young kids saw them uh and saw those ads and saw those t v programs and so it became uh a part of everyday life and the more you see something the more it becomes more acceptable so maybe that is having an effect maybe fifty years from now we will look back on those t v programs and think they were trend setting instead of stereotypical um but it i am sure it does have uh some influence because i think it did it was not the only thing that had an influence but it was one of the little pieces of the puzzle that that helps i think matthew shepherd helped also 

Recording: (7220/ 9621)

Recording: (7230/ 9621) 
at cosi 

Recording: (7231/ 9621) 
um the reason that it was one of the best years of my life is it is in a incredibly beautiful setting and the people that came to participate in that were very very high people and it was mostly of course young people but they were incredibly idealistic and incredibly searching for answers in um i mean their questions and their conversations talk about opinions <LAUGH> as a matter of fact the that is only thing i difficult about about living there was they would be asking all these INCREDIBLE QUESTIONS AND I WOULD BE trying to DO THE DISHES OR SOMETHING MUNDANE LIKE that it is like i do not want to do the dishes i just want to answer the questions

their daycare oh i do not know it is tough i think really i believe more in that large corporations need to have some kind of daycare offered it is just there is not that many people anymore that can afford to have a one income family i mean you know we could do it you know but you know we would not live as nice as we do we would not have as nice of cars as we do you know we would struggle a little more so so it is a toss up it is a real 

Recording: (7296/ 9621) 
well he is he is yeah he taught math but they had a general curriculum was just like he taught seventh grade he gave him math science um supposedly social studies all the stuff that i mean it was just it was very poorly run to begin with so we would go out and try and find books for the kids i do not know if you heard that they he had not bought them books and so we had to buy them AND i mean they got reimbursed but it was just ridiculous so they were trying to do anything they could and just to keep their jobs and keep the school

uh poor people can not do that um so after all is said and done with her case she was left with about a million dollars and then out of that million the attorney in the firm got a third plus she had to pay off his expenses so really she was probably left with only about three hundred thousand dollars which if used wisely okay maybe she could have but it sounded to me like she did not have a money problem anyway she was a corporate person um but a very stupid person um so i mean that is basically my my battle with the legal system i you know i have i have got a person right now that owes me five hundred dollars that i wanted to take to small claims court i even got the uh the cancelled check to prove it and everything but you know uh and when i look at what the alternative is which is subjecting myself to uh unfairness uh even though i feel i got a concrete no way you know uh those are the ones that i mean i would have to pay an attorney and the cheapest one i can find right now is a hundred forty five dollars an hour

they have not hum um 

Recording: (7327/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7328/ 9621) 
i i do not know i do not remember 

Recording: (7329/ 9621) 
i mean i think he is done some positive things that whole thing about um as far as like your student loans and being able to get INTO SCHOOL <LAUGH> which has helped me you know and i you know all this that as far as some of the issues go i think that that i feel pretty similar to the way he does um some of his foreign policy things i think have gone pretty decently but i mean i think i do not i do not know i mean it i i do not know if if it really if you really it i feel like that they are that whole health care thing which nothing ever happened with really you know and i think these people have a lot of really great ideas but they do not they do not ever really put anything into action they just kind of skate along you know and i do not know if there is anything substantial i can say and that was a wonderful thing that you did that i feel very affected by it um economy is fine i mean so it is not that he is not that he is doing a horrible job but i do not really know how much he is actually doing you know and i think that unfortunately spend a lot of your time trying to get out of out of personal issues that you have gotten yourself into and you can not really focus on anything that is that is positive that you wanna do for for the country and i think i think it is just too bad because i feel like if i was president uh not that i wanna be president but you know you would have three or four things that you would think were very important you would you would hire a lot of other people to take care of the other areas and people that were very competent that you would feel like they would actually be able to accomplish some things and you would really work to get some stuff done you know and i do not know if it is if it is just because you know you have to get agreement from all the other all the everybody else in government before you can pass anything or or why you know why do not these things get taken care of i mean there is so many different issues that people wanna look at and end up focusing on things like philip morris you know which is like the biggest thing in the whole world you know and and there is so many other things that i think you could be looking at that are that are important i just i do not know maybe i mean i do not i do not i am not real up on everything that is been done but i guess it just kind of seems like i wish people would be a little bit more focused and you and you would be able to say you know this is what there is these three things that i think are really important that i am really gonna work to make sure that they get taking care of and and i do not i just think people kind of ladeeda it and say well this is it is like this you know well we will see what we can kind of do about it and then we will you know 

Recording: (7330/ 9621) 
well see my my husband would do that though it is so bizarre because is i do not know what is i i honestly do not i think that is where his brain is completely lacking i make i get to make all the decisions at my house about discipline and about what people can do and can not do and we all understand this and it is perfectly fine and he says i am not a good judge of that you will have to check because my son when my son was like eleven he let him come to campus with his skateboarding friends i said where are they oh they said they were going down on i said on campus over my dead body <LAUGH> YKNOW he is not allowed down there 

Recording: (7331/ 9621) 
i listened to someone i just touched someone who will be successful you will be successful individual and that is what is most critical you yourself has to do it not the business because from you businesses observe 

Recording: (7332/ 9621) 
and we know that the result could be death then like and it and it is an an aggression thing one side will be the aggressor one would obviously because you can not have two uh two aggressive things uh uh naturally one would be aggressive and then one would be aggressive in it is response you can not you know what i mean so in like a state of war it was like that so in that context i think but like in the same context i feel it would be wrong for a soldier to kill a civilian because they did not um they did not decide to become a combatant so if you are an if you are a combatant and you make that decision or your drafted which that that is kind of like making the decision in the sense that you are part of that society that got you drafted so if you choose to be part of that society that i mean that is a little shadier if but still if you are if you both make the the desire to do it then so like if i were drafted i think i would fight i am sure i would fight for the country or you know but i do not think i would go like you know i just do not feel the need to go on a RAMPAGE OR ANYTHING 

Recording: (7333/ 9621)

you know and it was in the butt going get me wrong he told me he was gonna have me uh locked up for child abuse so i threw his ass in the car and took him downtown and took him inside and told him to tell them people because they are gonna lock him up 

Recording: (7392/ 9621) 
you know but you know kids they have to learn these things on their own i mean he is twenty two i still consider him a kid but they have to learn these things on their own you know when you go to look for apartment what you need to look for and what you need to check out you know are you going to be able to afford it and everything that goes with it and have a work study job <LAUGH> you know 

Recording: (7393/ 9621) 
i do not think so i do not think they did um but there was this other guy my mom was talking about the other day i do not know what she seen it on i guess he had did something like that and you know he was just listing they did like an interview with him and um told them how much you know things he did like he did this and that and i guess he broke into bank ones or something like that and got some accounts or something like that and i was like whoa yeah that is 

Recording: (7394/ 9621) 
pull out 

Recording: (7395/ 9621) 
media hype 

Recording: (7396/ 9621) 
are not really saying much new where if they have a more compact time they could be so i would like to see them see the time reduced the conventions used to be interesting because they debated the platforms and that is all settled now and it is just sort of a you know the celebration type stuff well that is not interesting well they could not change and move the primaries like to may 

Recording: (7397/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7398/ 9621) 
yes um well i was raised most of my life in ashland it is about ten minutes north of mansfield ohio and um i uh we moved there we move there from mansfield so i have been living in the mansfield ashland area for 

Recording: (7399/ 9621) 
i think she yeah she will 

Recording: (7400/ 9621) 
hm 

Recording: (7401/ 9621) 
there was an in depth story about that i think it was i was harper is magazine or what it was in a uh uh significant magazine where they had uh made a study of the new york situation and the i found that quite interesting and very very impressive uh as a matter of fact whatever it was i remember sending it in to the uh city council uh oh of dayton i just addressed the 

Recording: (7402/ 9621) 
there she is you know half naked and she is should be a center fold somewhere you know and those are little yeah disney movies cartoons i mean when you look at that you see it everywhere and it is really scary um but nobody is doing anything about it that i can see and they do not really see a concern but like i said wait till the generations start growing up wait till those little kids that we have put all those things in their head grows up then they will think wow we should have done something i know well i am i am scared i hope i do not live real long because <LAUGH> it is it is scary well and then the guy that um i do not even remember what his name was he got a drunk driving charge a judge he was a judge now he is out he went back to work on monday 

Recording: (7403/ 9621) 
highly skilled or trained in that area i mean you can not really do a simple sort of screening and these are good and these are bad uh and again as i mentioned previously i think it is more to do with maybe being aware of the interaction of you know the different students with each other and i mean if it was as bad as they claimed it to be or as it appeared to be and i mean you are you are never going to get rid of all of that because there are always different groups and different cliques but i can not help but thinking that if it was bad enough that you would do something like that that you know had to have been more than just you know sort of normal jocks versus whatever so i think it should be more i do not know i mean even you know i went to a private catholic highschools but even there you know there was you know uh a sense of that and i mean some of the things that went on should definitely not have been going on and that was only on a very small level there were eighty six people in my graduating class you know and i mean this is a highschool with like several hundred students that this happened at so 

Recording: (7404/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (7405/ 9621) 
you know i i said to myself because i had post partem depression with my third and fourth child and i thought it what good am my going to be to these children if i am not able to take care of them so decision was said after the fourth child we would practice birth control so i and i felt comfortable that 

Recording: (7406/ 9621) 
yeah i usually do not <LAUGH> not quite there YET not really 

Recording: (7407/ 9621) 
no sunlight you know the and they do not give him they keep it warm and he is not allowed sheets or razors or you know other than electric razors so he can not kill himself so you are just stuck there is nothing you could do all day for forty years or however until he naturally dies and that to me would be like that to me is actually like that has to be worse like just the agony and the and the i think you would have to go insane like there is only so much you can i would ask for board games or something but like he does not even hear a human voice because i think it is something like that was written in the scriptures like you are dead to the world for uh is the worse that you can do and so the world sees him you know what i mean so that would be rough that would be real rough and so obviously he would want to um i would like they say like now like people that observe him he is like sings to himself and he reads the bible like everyday and but like i do not know that would be strange be such a horrible thing to go through i could not imagine being locked in a room for like few days 

Recording: (7408/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (7409/ 9621) 
sixteen 

Recording: (7410/ 9621) 
a couple three times too butonthephoneandeverything and then sit there and say well you go ahead and you know you can call me every name in the book do whatever the heck you want to but i am stillyourfather so 

Recording: (7411/ 9621) 
just one school so that is how many of those there was 

Recording: (7412/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7413/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7414/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7415/ 9621) 
right yeah yeah that is very true 

Recording: (7416/ 9621) 
let us watch seven of nine 

Recording: (7417/ 9621) 
we well sort of and kind of yes we were i mean we dated in high school but he ended up going to prom with somebody else and we i mean we we went to went kindergarten all the way through and my sister and his sister were the same age and my mom an his mom were campfire leaders together and the whole bit and then we did not really date and um college kind of really did not get together at all freshman year he did go to school here and then um as i said i swam for ohio state and then i went into agler davidson a sporting goods store to um buy a swimsuit my sophomore year and he was a cashier there 

Recording: (7418/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (7419/ 9621) 
nope i i do not i would not i will i am not sending him to a columbus public school but an alternative school i will send him to um private school i do not i would if i had the money to tell you the truth i would most definitely but i know i could not afford it that is why i have never thought about it really 

Recording: (7420/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7421/ 9621) 
yeah stay away from salts uh sodium and stuff like that pop uh coffee i do not have no problem there i do not drink coffee i drink a lot of pop though uh like pork products 

Recording: (7422/ 9621) 
wow that is great 

Recording: (7423/ 9621) 
and a lot times unions uh they actually seem detrimental like to production and to like the actual individual needs of the members of the union because the if the union becomes powerful you can feel free to call off and things like that and like that that can actually make it worse because then the corporation sees these lazy a lazy union as representative of of these workers so they are more apt outside 

Recording: (7424/ 9621) 
yeah that would not work <LAUGH> 

Recording: (7425/ 9621) 
um-hum right 

Recording: (7426/ 9621) 
i know that is 

Recording: (7427/ 9621) 
um um 

Recording: (7428/ 9621) 
but i do not think it is bad 

Recording: (7429/ 9621) 
so you know one day um it was a really bad day i would gone to like tulsa oklahoma with somebody and came back and you know i like i said i had not had anything to eat the entire day and uh it was like it was like midnight and i got home and i thought oh i am too hungry you know to i am too tired and hungry and i just thought uh i am not making anything so i just went to bed and uh a guy knocked on my door which he lived upstairs in the apartment above me and he tell me are you in there and i would not answer well it was a real cheap apartment he took a credit card and punched the uh the door knob and 

Recording: (7430/ 9621) 
actually i wore out 

Recording: (7431/ 9621) 
is that right well a lot of all the places got these like little well known hiding spots you know like try try to keep them like a a like a secret a secret away from the tourists 

Recording: (7432/ 9621) 
the gays gays homosexual and all those 

Recording: (7433/ 9621) 
a few times that they did specifically say um homosexuality but i mean there were other things that they would cover i mean it is not like it was just an all out assault on being gay or anythinglikethat 

Recording: (7434/ 9621) 
within her her life they she she does more with the children because most of them live here you know our children are all away so 

Recording: (7435/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (7436/ 9621) 
i do not know i mean i think it is kind of ridiculous for kids to pay to chew gum you know or if they get caught chewing it desalles my all my cousins went to desalles and if they got caught chewing gum they had to pay 

Recording: (7437/ 9621) 
yeah well like i mean high school high school is always been really easy and like and like high school is really easy like i never really felt like challenged even remotely by anything like and so like high school is kind of like a joke and it was real fun and everything you know just to like not really have to do pretty much of anything you know and like um and like so college was a a little bit different i mean it was like a little bit more challenging i mean it is basically the same thing in high school you just have less time to do the material you know so it is just like as opposed to having three weeks to doing a paper and doing it the night before you have three days to do it and you still do it the night before it is just like i do not know i thought i just kind of like found out like that i really do not like school and like ever wanna go back and like having to take having to take math classes again like i just was like is not really my thing like when too like i always knew that this it would be like this you always have to take basic classes but like i was a history major and so it is like i do not care about math at all and like anything that i would do would be humanities or like so it is like 

Recording: (7438/ 9621) 
um-hum an all white jury 

Recording: (7439/ 9621) 
well i 

Recording: (7440/ 9621) 
and the questions are not easy i mean i mean the i doubt if i could pass some of them i mean i probably could pass the citizenship and the and the english and maybe the science because i like science and i keep up on that stuff but i doubt if i could pass the math because i do not teach math and i do not use math that much other than just normal you know add subtract multiply 

Recording: (7441/ 9621) 
uh i think they lost think ohio state lost because they was just out there ranting and raving and after a while it got out of hand and i 

Recording: (7442/ 9621) 
bad acoustics really 

Recording: (7443/ 9621) 
that is different 

Recording: (7444/ 9621) 
i do not think we take up huge amount and then uh we get some of the service through oar net as well which is i think it is just up lane avenue uh they give us the domain name and all that 

Recording: (7445/ 9621) 
like uh right now their biggest campaign is uh the some elementary school i believe or no i think it is a high school in marion was built on um an old weapons depot and so like leukemia has rise and so like that is uh their main campaign now is to inform the public and try and uh get that changed they have also done other things ah other uh they do anything dealing with the environment uh like exposure uh things like that so 

Recording: (7446/ 9621) 
over on an adjoining hill oh about half a mile away i guess and he was getting even for the day before 

Recording: (7447/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (7448/ 9621) 
and if it is not a necessity i will have to forfeit it right now while a lot of them want the necessities they also want some of the extras and in order to do that both have to work well consequently who is really raising the kids if they are lucky they have got a loving grandparent ninety nine times out of a hundred i do not know if that is a good statistic it is the babysitters or you know these places it is not a babysitter it is a babysitter school or something like that and that is not the same loving cuddling atmosphere that it had when mom was home and able to watch the kids and i think that that is of things they can change plus the fact that they change these stupid tv programs because that is a terrible influence a lot of kids it is taken over their life if it is not that now it is worse yet it is the kids are on the internet now that is even worse because now you can not even hear what they are getting into at least on tv you walk in see it and turn it off now you can go in i guess and see what they are on the internet sorry YOU can not have the internet anymore but i think those are all really they can be good influences if they have got the right program and the right person they are talking to but too many times it is the other way around 

Recording: (7449/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> YES exactly 

Recording: (7450/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> i hate my my last name is terrible i hate my last name 

Recording: (7451/ 9621) 
well muggings on the subway or stuff you know just in general 

Recording: (7452/ 9621) 
just do not talk when other people are talking just general things that i think you should take for granted 

Recording: (7453/ 9621) 
uh relax uh get a a dead end job that does not come home with me uh try and pay off my debt and maybe make a little bit so i i i uh grad school yeah but also enjoy all the things i did not get to do 

Recording: (7454/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (7455/ 9621) 
well when they had to cover their i know all of that but i do not think that is really been 

Recording: (7456/ 9621) 
or or somebody or or or later they will claim that i was coerced to saying that as i walked out the door you know and it is a big lie 

Recording: (7457/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (7458/ 9621) 
well i know people that will sleep outside and uh not all of them are veterans and everything but they there again they do not want to be a part of the quote unquote sheltered system you know uh staying at an open shelter v o a or something like that 

Recording: (7459/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7460/ 9621) 
and there is lighting effects like strobe lights disco balls 

Recording: (7461/ 9621) 
yeah just since march 

Recording: (7462/ 9621) 
i went to for grade school and for high school 

Recording: (7463/ 9621) 
or does this say this you know this is what i thought this said does that what that really says well here is a perfect example the other day my kids my sixth graders turned in papers on if i could be an animal here is the animal i would be and here is why and they had to research the animal they had like a month to do it and they had to pick any animal and tell about their feeding habits and their whether they travel in groups or alone and of what part of the world they mostly habitat what they eat all that okay perfect example one of my students wanted to say my animal that i picked lives mostly on vegetables and he could not figure out how spell it so he went into the computer and he asked it and it gave him the word vestibules 

Recording: (7464/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7465/ 9621) 
oh man 

Recording: (7466/ 9621) 
so um 

Recording: (7467/ 9621) 
then i 

Recording: (7468/ 9621) 
existing area mean they could actually well yeah they could actually make it to where they could put homeless people or something feed them or something 

Recording: (7469/ 9621) 
light news uh that is why i read tend to read the alternative newspapers and things because you do get a different perspective it is it is probably just as slanted but it is different you are right 

Recording: (7470/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7471/ 9621) 
i think so because i i 

Recording: (7472/ 9621) 
which is um which is actually a good place for her because a lot of those houses like right around the park of roses and those types of things you can get some that are older that need that need a lot of work but that is a pretty high demand area 

Recording: (7473/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7474/ 9621) 
all right 

Recording: (7475/ 9621) 
okay that is why they do a lot a lot of like biological studies is barrier okay i have heard of it 

Recording: (7476/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7477/ 9621) 
no i you had women that working before you had women working before but self discipline is family it is part of it self discipline making things too easy for us oh we can not do without it you ever you ever try to work for something i mean you really struggle to to achieve something did it mean more to you than something that was given to you tell me 

Recording: (7478/ 9621) 
well i will have a <LAUGH> maybe when i i am a hundred i will have that figured out 

Recording: (7479/ 9621) 
and my sister lives in the middle of NEBRASKA <LAUGH> nobody visits HER <LAUGH> nobody wants TO GO to nebraska yeah what is out there come watch the corn grow 

Recording: (7480/ 9621) 
that is sort of what i found interesting there too i mean there were a lot of jibes about that i remember um driving to germany with a couple a english friends and to visit some german friends of theirs and we got there and it we got lost and all these things that took us way longer than it should have and a friend of the person we were visiting said like oh what did you have to stop at every mcdonalds along the way and i was like i i am a VEGETARIAN i do not even eat at mcdonalds you know and i was just you know and it was really mean it is like that is not really a very good joke and that kind of thing came up quite frequently but you know i always said mcdonalds would not survive here if no one ate there and you can not tell me that everyone in there is american 

Recording: (7481/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (7482/ 9621) 
there well there is the whole thing about the police chief and then there is the whole thing about um about the the federal lawsuit against columbus 

Recording: (7483/ 9621) 
and that is what we are concerned with you need to interact more with people we need to interact more people every day of our life that is what we learn from we do not learn by giving things to people just like if you were um uh a parent giving a giving allowance you do not give them to your kids uh money to do chores and that you do not expect them to do but you give them something in addition to develop more responsibility but we do not talk about responsibility in our society today i i i dare you to say we are in a they say publicly this is our bill of responsibility do you know where there is do we talk about responsibilities now 

Recording: (7484/ 9621) 
yeah and it is uh and it is not too bad because i had to scratch off your ticket you gave me 

Recording: (7485/ 9621) 
i just well but i did not understand as much as you PROBABLY i just like like clueless as to what i needed to do to become an art major and i would go to my advisor and they would tell me what to take and it was the art advisor but i did not really think i had to do anything special like i did not know about the portfolio review and all that stuff and that was probably my own fault for not asking questions but so it took me a while and and i just kind of went to columbus state and went on a mission then came back and so i just got accepted into that college but YEAH 

Recording: (7486/ 9621) 
stuff like that and i think they even might have found like one or two guns so and that to me was but my high school is two thousand people so i guess by sheer numbers one or two persons would bring a gun 

Recording: (7487/ 9621) 
i do i am against religion in school i just do not think they should push that on people um you know i mean i do not think they should make people pray if they do not want to before class or anything you know like that but as far as morals and the right thing to do in life and what is out there and you know most kids know what the wrong thing is but 

Recording: (7488/ 9621) 
i am on the computer at least six hours a day 

Recording: (7489/ 9621) 
that is surprising 

Recording: (7490/ 9621) 
does that make sense 

Recording: (7491/ 9621) 
like just like like communal showers and stuff and like um just how it is like one room that you like kind of live in or whatever you know it is more like like the army or something you know like real everything is real simple and everything is uniform and like i do not know 

Recording: (7492/ 9621) 
and she just came here and lived with me a year ago she could have her baby here 

Recording: (7493/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7494/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7495/ 9621) 
yeah i think that is you know i am i am not that familiar with it now but i think that they are getting better and and seeing the cracks and things like that the people fall through 

Recording: (7496/ 9621) 
yeah <LAUGH> 

Recording: (7497/ 9621) 
well i get the sense that if there are discipline problems it is so hard to get anything done solve them unless you unless somebody brings a gun and waves it around the school ya know that is the big thing now but just that ya know it is just so hard to get anything done um and i think at that point the teachers get frustrated because they do not see the support throughout through the administration and if they do have they have to wait til something is pretty pretty egregious before they before it is dealt with 

Recording: (7498/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7499/ 9621) 
i would be a lot happier 

Recording: (7500/ 9621) 
i actually joined the church in uh well i do not know it was six years ago about six years ago and they did a survey here at o s u and they were um just asking people if they thought that christ had visited america and there was a record of that account if do i think that would be important and i was like well i think so yeah <LAUGH> and but i did not i was kinda hesitant i mean it took me a while to i read the book of mormon i really prayed about it and took me about six months and and then i finally decided that i really liked it and it was what i had been wanting so so that is how i decided 

Recording: (7501/ 9621) 
right because everything that has a coupon has tons of fat tons of sugar and is overpriced 

Recording: (7502/ 9621) 
yeah they yeah she moved in with him 

Recording: (7503/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7504/ 9621) 
is that right 

Recording: (7505/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7506/ 9621) 
so indirectly it was a very bad reason that i came here but it worked out 

Recording: (7507/ 9621) 
blond haired blue eyed overweight people 

Recording: (7508/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (7509/ 9621) 
and continue merrily on with my day 

Recording: (7510/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7511/ 9621) 
well not really they uh have a lot of um religious beliefs on their own that they have had held on to because um they have just have had nothing 

Recording: (7512/ 9621) 
right

Recording: (7524/ 9621) 
with their cycle uh that is the way the indian people believe that many of the woman refer to it as they are on their moon because when the moon is out the moon is that sacred and there is that that life women have that uh gift of life that they can give uh men can not do that um there is just a lot there that uh you know women go through that purification every month so women really do not need the sweat lodge but it is there for them and they do participate um

Recording: (7527/ 9621) 
okay <LAUGH> 

Recording: (7528/ 9621) 
uh yeah um yes and no they are kind of weird like that um one set of grandparents really i can not hear ever says anything there is a set on the other side that they are a little bit more racist um but at the same time it i do not know they almost set up like a double standard for black people there are black people that they really like and i mean they are actually friends with some black people and there are black people that they do not like for whatever the reason may be and those are the people that they are racist towards i mean it is the same thing that goes with white people obviously there are white you can stand they are white people that are just obnoxious and you do not wanna deal with um i mean it is basically the same thing right yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly um i really do not think we do for the most part i can not say i see any real big problems or anything like that that occur just because of the sex you are or anything i think that probably would have caused a bigger problem than the black president um honestly um although i do not really see too many sexist problems i definitely do see guys still be more like the decision making type and as being like the final say in things rather than women and i would see them having an authority figure that is being a woman as causing problems to em 

Recording: (7529/ 9621) 
um-hum it is real well known 

Recording: (7530/ 9621) 
um-hum

right 

Recording: (7538/ 9621) 
oh what are you doing that for oh 

Recording: (7539/ 9621) 
um not really because i think you know if if they are going to they are going to and i do not think a lot of them at that stage are gonna go out of their way to go and buy them so i do not think it is like oh i have a condom i am going to have sex i mean actually it is this is is very hot topic in england right now because they they have got the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in the world and i mean there are stories everywhere about you know twelve year olds having babies and i mean there they have gone to distributing condoms on playgrounds which i do think is a little bit too much i think maybe having them available in the nurses office is one thing they are there you know they can go and and get some or something but i think actually like physically you know passing them out is a bad idea but demonstrating and that kind of thing i think is pretty important just you know uh because of the simple fact of the statistics that they are they are doing it so at least at the very least they might as well be you know safe about it 

Recording: (7540/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7541/ 9621) 
yeah she still lives with family 

Recording: (7542/ 9621) 
because then you know what if something major happens that fourth time then what but i think i at least for children especially because they have no means to to help themselves and like the parents obviously even if they are working a lot of times can not get healthcare for their children so i think at least for children because how many accidents happen to children like people are always breaking arms and stuff 

Recording: (7543/ 9621)

Recording: (7548/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7549/ 9621) 
but uh she likes the spirituality of the community over there and

Recording: (7554/ 9621) 
i think they have got more money i do not know if that necessarily makes them a better school um i think a lot of it is is is really what you what uh as far as as a parent is what you expect your children to achieve in school and what they want to get out of it you know my my family my brothers and sisters they all went to public schools and and they took advanced a p classes and and they worked real hard and and they have got i think that they have options 

Recording: (7555/ 9621)

Recording: (7556/ 9621) 
uh okay well there few years ago there was this big fuss so ya know we have got to close some schools ya know enrollment is dropping it is ya know it is the way population goes enrollment is dropping we can not afford to keep them all going so let us close and they did this big study and they targeted some to close well there was a big uproar from the people who is kids went to that school like there will be whenever you close a school so the board backed down and changed it is mind the next year they came out with a study saying they need more schools but there was not the money for it so there was a big fuss about that then two years later they came out with another study it says well they need to refurbish or not some schools close a couple then knock some down and rebuild em and it is like every two years it is a different direction and it is like they are almost afraid to take a stand that somebody is not gonna like well if you are gonna shut a school down somebody is gonna be really ticked off 

Recording: (7557/ 9621) 
yeah i have run into that a lot i think part of it was the high school i went to i mean i have gone to catholic schools all my life or whatever and obviously i have run into a lot more of the wealthier type people who either just do not have time or do not have the interest and just pay people to do it 

Recording: (7558/ 9621) 
it is like like sometimes too i think about people you know they call and especially when i talk to this sometimes people call in and i i you know i get the same people or whatever every once in a while especially if like there is people have real specific weird names or something that i can remember i will they will call back and i will think about them and it is like how i will have this you know it is like we have this weird like five minute relationship something like that like every couple of weeks or something and it is like what to think about what their life is like and what they are actually like in the you know it is like it is real weird it is like i know yeah get everybody

Recording: (7570/ 9621) 
now that does not make any extra work for the teacher but it gives him a shot he usually will answer the concepts he will usually answer the main stuff that he knows and if you only grade him on that he might have a shot at a c or a b i mean there is all kind of ways to modify uh give a reduced work amount uh give a kid a copy of another students notes if his are crummy and he can not study from them we even have a thing at our school that it is it looks just like notebook paper and it is got the three holes and the lines and every teacher has a stack of it on their desk but it is n c r you know the two copies

Recording: (7614/ 9621) 
maybe i will move to australia 

Recording: (7615/ 9621) 
they got all that white sand and uh uh you know that that water can see down for miles and uh 

Recording: (7616/ 9621) 
and uh we met i was working at a restaurant in short north and they were having a christmas party and his brother worked there and he brought my husband and i went there and that is how we met <LAUGH> 

Recording: (7617/ 9621) 
but yet they will not lay off people that actually need the jobs 

Recording: (7618/ 9621) 
he ended up dying he ended up dying from um what is that disease aids thank you from the aids virus that is going around when he was near dying what did he tell his mother i will not use the exact words because there was profanity in it but he said i really up my life did not i mom and he is got three kids three grown kids right now so you see what made him change what influence in society do that i do not know how we find it but i think if more people i do not think it was ever taught in the bible to do that was it and i i really do not think so and i do not ever you know hear it i am not that well versed when it comes to the BIBLE <LAUGH> but uh i do believe there is a god and i do believe in prayer and i do believe in guardian angels watching over you and i do not think you have to go to church to really believe all this because it is how you treat the other person that really counts and if i treat that person basically it boils down to treat the other person the way you would like to be treated 

Recording: (7619/ 9621) 
yeah i remember political correctness 

Recording: (7620/ 9621) 
uh it sucked 

Recording: (7621/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7622/ 9621) 
um i used to be a charter pilot and a flight instructor and i used to go to work at like eight oclock in the morning and get home for my first meal with johnny carson and i did this six days a week and to get my my one day off i would get up at like at seven oclock get in my car and drive to the mall and park and sleep in my car 

Recording: (7623/ 9621) 
AND <LAUGH> there was one where they were going along and there is a little uh scroungey looking dog about so long and about that high kind of following along after them joe i am glad that i finally see somebody i can be sorry for that is worse worse off than i AM 

Recording: (7624/ 9621) 
oh really 

Recording: (7625/ 9621) 
i really think civil rights have gone too far because for every rule that says you cannot do this to the other person there is another rule says that that is okay if that other person does it to you i mean my mother used to say for every law that was written there is another law written over here that will actually nullify that one and i and actually as i have grown older i have found that and it is it is worse in today is world as i said as the rights and you have a right to this and you have a right to that it is terrible murderers get away with murder now by that plea bargain that plea bargain i think is the most thing that ever was passed i do not think there should be any plea bargains oh but there are people who get murdered eh and sent to the electric chair electric chair i still believe in it because if someone is and i do not believe that they should have ten years of uh what do they call that legal process where they can appeals thank you that is it i do not think that you should have that either one appeal or two should be the limit if they are still found guilty sorry and if an innocent person has not been able to prove he is innocent that is just one of those freaky things that happens because sometimes innocent people do pay the penalty for someone else that is guilty that is corrupt enough in his mind that he knows how to get away with it and get somebody else take his blame but i do not think there is that many innocent people that ever went to the electric chair that they should actually have nullified that because what right does that person have to live tv just about two or three days ago and here is this guy down in the south end and as he is walked out handcuffs behind him and they are putting him in the cruiser welp i did to her exactly what i said i is gonna do i is watch her draw her last breath he killed her now he is gonna go and probably maybe a plea bargain and he will get off with it because maybe he was abused as a child and that had something do with the way he was thinking what happened to this woman because of it i am sorry let him pay the penalty and if more people paid the penalty there would be more people thinking twice three four times before they did the same thing and that would help i think to stop some of that 

Recording: (7626/ 9621) 
that is exactly what it IS <LAUGH> 

Recording: (7627/ 9621) 
well i do not know that that is a cause uh a it they they as a group uh and this was kind of a happenstance it this occurred as a result of a very major world war uh so in in terms of them causing it it was there was a happenstance and and part of this mass communication we are talking about uh began with them and yes they are a major influence because we were talking about numbers and you are talking about uh a a greater inter communication i would like to go back one step where we are talking about when i made mention that three doors down you do not even know who that individual is and i want to stick with that uh i think that is profound as an individual communication we are nearing zero in terms of global mass communication to everybody inner personal communications that is the key in my opinion personal versus inner personal communications and it is zero over here and we are almost a hundred percent over here but when we are in this inner personal or global or massive whichever term is the most appropriate um john doe who speak here he has not the faintest idea who jane doe is over here on the personal it used to be that yeah you knew who this person over here that is jane doe that lives in that third house and she married henry jackson do not you remember old henry well henry was the guy that lived way over there on the other side of town mass communications as it is today they have not the faintest idea of where jane came from or where henry jackson or where old whoever IT WAS LIVED OVER THERE I SAID so i think uh the i i think you need to distinguish between the personal inner personal relationship so maybe i digress too far there or who the next door neighbor is 

Recording: (7628/ 9621) 
well i see i am gonna have to fall way back and show my age again as most people would say uh i i would really like to see this to happen but i also know that it most it will never happen within the next three or four generations but i i am of a guy who still believes that the lady has a place in her home and i do not believe that we need a man and wife out working and making incomes as everyone in the united states today feels they must uh hazel hit upon it rather lightly a while ago and was talking about need versus uh luxuries i want i want i want well i uh my judgment is that we are spending today probably eighty percent of uh the income on things that they want and only twenty percent on what they need and that is all they need to spend on that need so therefore the pardon 

Recording: (7629/ 9621) 
yeah i am i am opposed to parental consent um but i do not have kids so that is that opinion does not mean as MUCH AS IT MIGHT from someone who did 

Recording: (7630/ 9621) 
oh really i had not heard that know it it uh some of it when clinton has backed down i think i sorta summarized what i just said is you know for the health insurance and reform with that all that health insurance area um yeah he backed down but it was not gonna happen so he could keep know the furor going for months and months or years and still nothing was gonna happen it was the wrong time or try to move on to something else uh i think it is regrettable it has not come back like you said it is like well i made the one attempt and did not go anywhere so let us let it drop and count for somebody else to pick it up well clinton is in lame duck it is why can not he bring it back 

Recording: (7631/ 9621) 
i do not think so 

Recording: (7632/ 9621) 
yeah just having fun 

Recording: (7633/ 9621) 
<LAUGH>

Recording: (7711/ 9621) 
oh yeah i would say so 

Recording: (7712/ 9621) 
yeah there was a lot of positive things uh from it as far as discipline as far as uh uh growing up faster and everything you know sometimes when i see a girl like my daughter or like other other people at that age you know and everything i you know they tend to act grown up you know or i felt like i was forced to grow up you know 

Recording: (7713/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> YKNOW 

Recording: (7714/ 9621) 
kept promoting and then all of sudden about nineties they came around and said hey you know what our our deficit is going the other way we are we are going way out of whack on this thing that is because we have been spending more consumers are doing the same thing they have not learned that mom and dad remember mom when out and got a little piece as the time as they needed things no i want the whole house completely furnished i want the cars we do not talk about buying cars nowadays we talk about leasing cars and pretty soon we are not gonna be buying houses we will be leasing houses from the finance companies we will not be owning the land the finance company own the you do not own it you are leasing it and that is our quality of life and when we go to third world countries we say i do not know how they can stand living here and yet you know what they probably have better quality of understanding one another then we do because i feel like the more you get closer to one another the further you become apart 

Recording: (7715/ 9621) 
and then i have a daughter in tulsa oklahoma and i have a daughter in ruston virginia so they did they are all well three are married yeah

Recording: (7717/ 9621) 
she is got like a third grade education she is like a kid herself 

Recording: (7718/ 9621) 
yeah i have not i i really have not even have not even given it that much thought yet 

Recording: (7719/ 9621) 
or they did not say it loud enough that you have the right to well i was never told i had the right see i never was told i could make the telephone call and if they can convince them and the poor police men can not i think really what they ought to start doing is taping everything that is said and taping it so it is so clear that there is no way that they can deny it and then yet they have got that thing allowed it is illegal civil rights you can not tape what i am saying it is like we signed the paper for you then get them to get them to sign when they go in there you fully understand now what we are going to do and if boy if they say then they really make it so and ask them two or three times on tape that they understand this before they sign this even well then how could they say that they uh they have got to come up with new rules and they got to make the penalties stick 

Recording: (7720/ 9621) 
uh which we we encouraged that 

Recording: (7721/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7722/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7723/ 9621) 
um-hum

starting over means putting a new operating system on it 

Recording: (7727/ 9621) 
you are really smart no you are not dumb but they sit in class and they see their friends just catch on to things and that they can not do and so then they say well my parents are just saying that because they love me i am really stupid you know and you have to actually ow them when they get to be this age that look you have a hundred and seventeen i q 

Recording: (7728/ 9621)

Recording: (7734/ 9621)

Recording: (7735/ 9621) 
correct 

Recording: (7736/ 9621)

Recording: (7754/ 9621) 
i believe them <LAUGH> i do i i i it is i mean it is a very personal thing and if that is what they saw most of my patients are head traumas so they can come up with some pretty wild stories but those visions are usually pretty clear and 

Recording: (7755/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7756/ 9621) 
no it would probably be something with his foreign policy or domestic policy that would change my mind 

Recording: (7757/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7758/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7759/ 9621) 
there is not a lot around you know and we were on the list forever we were on the list five years before we had our first kid SO <LAUGH> YEAH they called well are you still wanna be on the list yeah we do not have any children but keep us on the LIST you know and it is like you said it is a and there is three or four hundred kids in that daycare it is a large daycare but there is not a lot out there that is good quality you know i mean you will it is scary and then you see it in the news and then uh they were abusing the kids or you know and you do not wanna go to work feeling that you are worrying about your kids and we have never really felt like that and we kind of work a little different shifts my wife and i so our kids are only actually there about five hours a day because she does not start until nine thirty and i pick them up at four so 

Recording: (7760/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7761/ 9621) 
oh its real negative she is real negative about things and and tries to put me down for being positive or you know i always see a way out of something and she does not and she i think she gets kind of mad and plus she is feels like she is old at fifty and i said oh my gosh you do not even have any bad habits i said you know you could live to be a hundred that is fifty more years you know i mean if you look at it that way she is really you know fifty is not old at all to me i mean that is just you as much as you learn you know you can not trade but yeah my my one sister that is um exactly seven years older than me we are the closest and then the sister that is two years older than me she is the same way she does a lot of things that i am like why are you doing that you know do not DO THAT so she is she pretty much stays low and depressed a lot because of everything she goes through but 

Recording: (7762/ 9621) 
yeah she she had a talk and my sister and i attended and i do not like the problem i think with universal healthcare would be everyone do not you think like everyone with the littlest scratch would go in you know as opposed to like the very and i think that could drive costs up so there has to be a way to balance it i am not sure how you would go about doing that because you do not wanna put a limit and say okay you can only go three times a year 

Recording: (7763/ 9621) 
read the paper and have the tv on if there is something i think i might wanna i might be interested in so i just do all those things and do my machine 

Recording: (7764/ 9621) 
i do not know i think i really do not know i think in today is world what they call the nineties that uh it is just like everything is changed like when i grew up we kids that grew up when we grew up and everything else we had standards and there were certain things we did or did not do and then it came along that when our kids grew up then there was so many things that changed and some i think one thing like it stands out and this has nothing do with politics but it is an example in in school they changed the way they were doing their mathematics i could not even help my kids with their mathematics sometimes and i took geometry and algebra you would think yet i used to get straight as in algebra and when i got to geometry i thought why am i taking this so that was not so good but still the way they were teaching it now and they are reteaching it entirely different now and i think linda explained it how they were doing it with math here and said she could not even help him and so you know it is in the same way with politics it people i guess change over the years their outlook on life changes or their whatever changes and i think it is to me it is getting worse but then my mother USED TO SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT OUR GENERATION so i think it is just a sign of the times i do not know what it is 

Recording: (7765/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7766/ 9621)

Recording: (7772/ 9621) 
that you really can get a lot out of it if that is something you want to do and i think as long as you are involved with the school 

Recording: (7773/ 9621)

um-hum i just had a uh healthy vigorous conversation last night with a township trustee jersey township which is just over in uh licking county and uh this gentleman is <exteighty> three or four years of age and he is been the township trustee various times throughout his life and he is very very concerned because of the exploding back up he is a farmer has been a farmer all of his life he owns about a hundred and fifty acres adjacent to approximately a thousand which his son is mainly operating yet he goes out and works too uh helps out at at this age uh but he is concerned because they have just recently passed an ordinance within the county which allows developers to come in and already they are ready to take over a couple farms that are fairly close to him but it affects the whole township and one of the things that they left out as he put it one of the ordinances that he pushed and pushed and pushed he wanted a specific part of that ordinance to say every so many people that move in to this area you must provide for a school and he said of and then he said they did not do it and he said i push and push and he said i did not know all the influence was on on the side to get more houses get more houses because it was gonna produce more taxes but they he kept saying well what do you want these taxes for if you are not gonna provide for schools so he was very concerned about that so here was a case in my opinion a very very honest uh politician but he was also being shoved away from what he felt was an honest approach 

Recording: (7869/ 9621) 
well clown cone is not there ANYMORE clown cone uh you could get like a bag of um tootsie rolls and pay only five cents so um that is gone AND UM <LAUGH> that was a kid thing um my grandfather used to own m market

Recording: (7892/ 9621) 
yeah um it is awareness again i mean you know put two and two together you get some young teachers right out of of college and then you put em with all these high school girls and these girls are looking like twenty and twenty two i mean you can not even you can not control the attraction there but you can be aware of it and you can you can um put the put slacks on girls and not leave it up to them to choose the height of their skirts and you know and they have got stairs up and down and you know they get in their lockers and they bend over you know and that is that is just too much i mean i think that is the first thing that has to be done take away that you know they should not even be uh that should not even be a thought you know and it is distracting enough for the the guys their own age but then you put these young teachers in there maybe they are single guys that were just had a hell of a time in hall in college and then they get around all these girls and like oh my gosh well you know you gotta look at that you gotta be more aware

Recording: (7898/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7899/ 9621) 
right um personally i think it is a good idea i mean uh i i mean to me you know it seems only logical that you would only have the amount of children that you can support you know and that but i come from a completely different you know background and everything else and the education and a lot you know then most of probably the people that this would um concern but i do think i i do not know i mean with uh the birth control that is available and you know all the options that there are sometimes i find it hard to be sympathetic for you know these people who just have so many children that they can not feed they can not take care of i mean it is not like it was way back when when there was nothing and you were just stuck this way i mean a woman can you know protect herself if you know the the man is not willing to do it or whatever so and and and adoption and all the other things 

Recording: (7900/ 9621)

um i i see it as a problem and and if i if i if i were african american i would i would not like to see it simply because uh you know it it it is a a child not being brought up in his you know in his tradition but on the other hand i would hate to i hate to see a child left in foster care or in an orphanage when he could have a home and um i think ah parents who are willing to uh going willing to adopt uh a black child or a mixed race child or an asian child or any are gonna are gonna be sensitive to the to cultural things because we are just you know it is just the the way things are slanted these days i mean diversity is an issue and people who are willing to venture out into uh mixed race adoption would already be way hip

Recording: (8071/ 9621) 
i think uh i did not know the difference so it did not affect me at all it is just they are just another person um i think more uh as i am being exposed to patients with the different lifestyles and knowing how to educate their caregivers and what they need um i felt somewhat uh ill equipped the first few times but um knowing what the expectations are especially like with spinal cord injury patients and when you go into sexuality and teaching them after injury i mean as a nurse you need to be able to educate them i felt pretty <LAUGH> 

Recording: (8072/ 9621)

Recording: (8080/ 9621) 
yeah you know like when i worked in westerville i had bought my house because i used to live work um off of east north broadway and the freeway and uh i thought i was gonna be there forever 

Recording: (8081/ 9621)

so i mean it is that is what i am saying the uh i think it is even american disabilities act talks about certain things about employers um and and with my lawsuit you know with the uh the chill and you know with all the public trials of high profile trials i think it is education for everyone to know that the legal system sucks and does not work um is not fair it is a rich man is person or a rich person is system judges are bought and paid for they are elected um there is a lot of crap there and learned all this not from just my experience but from people that i know that are attorneys that there are judges down there that take bribes and that is that is not right so you can not when you are dealing with that system justice comes at a price and you get as much justice as you can afford and during my lawsuit that was very evident you know laws are made to protect people that are wealthy and that commit crimes and it is not right it is not fair but that is the way it is so um i did not wanna go into law <LAUGH> did not wanna go into paralegal i was looking into that and lady kept hounding me and telling me you know well maybe you could get in it to make a difference i am like why would i wanna make a difference if it kills me you know because i know myself and i do not put up with crap you know i see a liar i bring him out you know and uh i was just brought up to be an honest person and um unfortunately there is a lot of people out there that you know they sell out their ideals and their principles for forty thousand dollars a year and then they use their family or their situation financially excuse to sell those ideals out i am not that kind of person and i will not ever be um so if that means that i stay monetarily poor for the rest of my life then so be it you know i got a conscience and uh and people that are honest and have a conscience are dangerous out there BUT THATS you know that is basically where i have been you know um i have lived here my whole life like i said i went to college i played baseball um due to injuries you know knees and shoulder i just i was very i was pro caliber you know uh i played baseball with the with paul oneil and kent murker which are a couple of guys that you know did get signed PROFESSIONALLY and are playing right now um so at least i can say i played against them and uh least with kent murker i can say i hit a home run off of him so that was a while ago but that was when he was young and very good AND I WAS i was three or four years older and still took him deep to center field so i will never forget that but uh i earned that <LAUGH> so that is um well um well that uh you know i i do not refer to it as an accident anymore you know they are um my whole life it changed ah in every facet um from it um you know physically emotionally mentally and spiritually um used to be catholic i do not follow that way anymore and um yeah i follow more uh ah natural way of following god nothing uh new age i do not wanna say exactly what you know just say that the people this land long time ago before anybody came over here with their bibles and crap um ramming jesus down people is throat the people of this land had a way of worshipping god and that is the way i wanna that is the way i follow um so a lot of people say that is native AMERICAN or say that is indian or whatever you know i do not care what they wanna put on it but it is it is that is a natural way of following god it is the way i put it you know worshipping that there and respecting the spirit that moves through all things all living things and uh so i went through all that all those changes and uh are still you know coping with them and trying to find ways to cope with them to 

Recording: (8100/ 9621)

Recording: (8102/ 9621) 
he is 

Recording: (8103/ 9621) 
i know i know well it is good to have that i think it would be good to have that leeway <LAUGH> but i am not sure i would trust myself because there there were definitely times when i was teaching when i would have more of an affinity towards certain students and less towards others and i wanted to be fair in terms of um not cutting down the ones i did not like that much <LAUGH> yeah yeah 

Recording: (8104/ 9621) 
you do not 

Recording: (8105/ 9621)

Recording: (8108/ 9621) 
um-hum sure 

Recording: (8109/ 9621) 
he is really just <LAUGH> yeah he just does not think through the implications of things real well in his personal life 

Recording: (8110/ 9621) 
i mean obviously being uh being a little boy i remember i mean just seeing even things like football or whatever i mean it is you would see something you thought it was neat so you would do it or whatever 

Recording: (8111/ 9621) 
it helps the curve <LAUGH>

i was working out there 

Recording: (8114/ 9621) 
i wish they could 

Recording: (8115/ 9621) 
uhhum

columbus needs that as much people do not want other things to close i just feel we have to keep we have to grow those people have to travel so far to shop and you know i do not think that is really fair to them

Recording: (8119/ 9621) 
oh she is a cute she really is really cute i mean i mean she is got big eyes and big fluffy cheeks 

Recording: (8120/ 9621) 
so he is gonna be somebody can complain about something well that is another thing where you have to take the individuality into account because not everybody likes to cook you know everybody most people know how to open a can of soup or something and boil water make some toast but you know that is about all that they wanna do as far as it comes to cooking even if they do have to cook for their family not everybody not every female likes to cook you know they just do it because you know they are supposed to or whatever and i know some families where the men the the husband does all of the grocery shopping and all the cooking and the wife does you know whatever she does i mean it it is individuality again so 

Recording: (8121/ 9621) 
okay so people can like fly in do do their do their little wedding thing fly out 

Recording: (8122/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> yeah it is weird like i do not know this microphone is a little bit different so 

Recording: (8123/ 9621) 
it does not so much bother me it is just having it forced on me like i said just sort of gives me a different opinion of it 

Recording: (8124/ 9621) 
and you even got these the uh what stunt guns they are the ones that scare me 

Recording: (8125/ 9621) 
yeah jason and and i and i went together 

Recording: (8126/ 9621) 
um-hum um-hum 

Recording: (8127/ 9621) 
see it there again the business out foxed the consumer basically you need to do less consumption and buying material goods and sharing your time with one another trying to understand your neighbor more and spending time giving quality time for understanding the intangibles of life the tangibles depreciate and they will depreciate and will be nothing and your investments gone 

Recording: (8128/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8129/ 9621) 
well that used to be where you know all the teenage teenagers went 

Recording: (8130/ 9621) 
yeah exactly 

Recording: (8131/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8132/ 9621) 
um i mean i feel i lean toward no i do not have a problem actually i saw something on the news the other night about they were offering um crack mothers like money for sterilization and there was a big debate about that um but again like the argument there on the human rights side was that if they are you know on cocaine or whatever they can not make the sound decision to be sterilized but at the same time like can they make the sound decision to have children 

Recording: (8133/ 9621) 
because see well i have had five babies you know i really have to work when you talked about that the older you get i have to work really really hard to stay in halfway decent shape 

Recording: (8134/ 9621) 
i love IT <LAUGH> 

Recording: (8135/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8136/ 9621) 
no i mean the money you know the money is great you know fine it is the biggest raise they have ever given anybody here at the university and actually the deal that they offered the sunday before they went out on strike was a better deal than what they have really settled for now as far as because the signing bonus was more and the big stipulation was the fact that these people did not wanna be separated from the hospital they do not think it is fair you know that you start down at the hospital as a janitor or whatever and you make this amount and if you came to main campus you would make seventy five cents more an hour automatic and then they did the raise and they wanted eighty cents at the hospital and a dollar on main campus and stuff so that is kind of a sticky situation because they have always kept the university and the hospital separate budget they are definitely a separate budget and you know the u hospital i can see where they are coming from everybody in the hospital business is struggling right now with the insurance problems and this and that and they are thirty five million in the hole because they bought o s u east and all this but you know it is not the unions fault that they ran out the contract you know and you know so and what we find in our area mainly is that people the entrance wage is so low that it is hard to find anybody that has any skills to come in and do the jobs that is you know and they want this place to be the top ten in the nation or whatever as far as but they are not willing to pay a lot of these people and you know they think contracting is the way but you are always gonna have to have people here to because contractors just do not drop what they are doing and show up today and a lot of times we have a job finished before they have written up the work order 

Recording: (8137/ 9621) 
well when you have formulas to make bombs and you know 

Recording: (8138/ 9621) 
um-hum it is at it is at the same building actually it is it is it is used for different things 

Recording: (8139/ 9621) 
yeah i was only nineteen well i was eighteen when i went in but 

Recording: (8140/ 9621) 
exactly but i do there and there is the other side um they uh with with native americans too it is you know you know our children are being taken away from us well not exactly you are giving up your children and and then something has to be done but but there is also there is also that uh i i mean i think that it is probably a legitimate fear that children children of that group are gonna you know gonna be homogenized out of out of their heritage but i do not know uh you know they are kids without parents <LAUGH> 

Recording: (8141/ 9621) 
i mean there are gays in congress there are gays in the military and just as long as people do not know that they do not feel threatened see and and i i uh i i do not understand that mindset i really do not i do not know why uh a man feels threatened by a having gay near them um i have a couple of gay friends and and one of my friends always says um you know does every man like every woman he sees is he attracted to every woman and you know want to go to bed with every woman you know what makes a man think that just because i am gay i might be interested in him you know that is the height of arrogance um you know but but men feel threatened by that just as i guess women feel threatened by lesbians i do not know but it is not a mindset i have so it is hard for me to understand 

Recording: (8142/ 9621) 
is that just to get a volume level 

Recording: (8143/ 9621) 
okay i might want to try to adjust this a little bit again if you say it goes under my putting it under here dontknowifthatwoulduh help yeahthatwasprobablygonnastaybetter

oh they it was nice actually i ate a lot more healthy and um it was cheaper i was getting money on my buck i d so i actually got paid every day 

Recording: (8174/ 9621) 
you know imagine it and that is basically what happened to her and her mom had three kids by three different dads and they thought if they could get her out of that environment they actually had her move in with them they were her temporary foster parents and she just turned sixteen so she was fifteen when she moved in with them she refused to change and i do not know what could have changed it if they would have got her out earlier but basically all three of them i do not wanna say are doomed but they are not even though they are out of that environment they are not doing any better 

Recording: (8175/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (8176/ 9621) 
yeah you still have to be careful and yeah 

Recording: (8177/ 9621) 
um-hum i am sure somewhere i am sure somewhere along the line that they would work things out to try to help her over those bumps it would not be long term and they would know that it would not be long term but that is the intangible i am saying you have somebody there because she is giving up her time and not to make the high bucks but what she is bringing about is developing a character in a person to bring about the spirituality in a person that is gonna carry them all through life she is also um tithing more than tithing probably uh which uh i always uh kid with people i said the author said ten percent tithing knew inflation he knew great about economics ten percent is ten percent and then uh on top of that you know we talked about economics uh little further here uh the japanese so forth they save so much more and the and germans so forth and uh boy you know taking that page out of the old bible are not they we do not <LAUGH> 

Recording: (8178/ 9621) 
yeah because it is the midwest yeah 

Recording: (8179/ 9621) 
well like i am getting ready to go through layoffs again where i work at 

Recording: (8180/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (8181/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (8182/ 9621) 
because that is more boring 

Recording: (8183/ 9621) 
um to move forward in my life now what happened with the chill was you know there was uh i had a friend that worked for them so they did not know that and um uh he told me that there was glass in the back room that they were supposed to install were supposed to have installed that was five feet higher three to five feet higher and um should have would have could have you know if it was up i would not have got hit i mean there is no two ways about it but if i did not get hit i would not be where i am now spiritually so i do not refute it as an accident and most of the spiritual leaders and people i talked to ah went through the catholic church because that was where i was raised and what i was raised and none of those people could provide me with any adequate things terms of counseling i know they tried i know they did the best that they could but um there is a lot of things that the catholic church will not like to admit that they are wrong on and they are wrong um uh they will sit there and ask me to atone for my sins yet they will not atone for the sins of all the priests that are molesting children still to this day and they protect them and that is not right and i am very very uh outspoken about that so rather than banging my head on the wall to people who would not listen i just decided to leave the church i do not go there anymore the only time i have gone there was for my nephew is baptism and my grandparents funeral and that is the only time you will find me in there you know i went to a wedding too but it is difficult sitting in there because of the way i follow now and uh and actually seeing things for what they are and it is frustrating not being able to explain that to people but that is okay um with the lawsuit ah we had a private investigator that went in there and found all the information that showed that they had all that higher taller glass back there over a year so they tried to use the excuse their excuse was that they could not find the hardware to install it and uh given all the hardware stores that we have here and the ability to over night freight things uh if it was any kind of ah special hardware that needed to be ordered from out of state or out of the country there is no excuse so basically you know it came down to after it came to a legal battle which was ah i was not gonna back down they were um i was poor monetarily and they knew that so they were using the legal system to wear me down um the first uh at the date of filing i mean first of all it took i had a statute of limitations was two years uh i had an attorney in a law firm representing but they were dragging their feet i felt they were dragging their feet because they were in bed with the chill you know and that they were getting paid under the table to drag their feet even though i knew the guy so i just said well look i am dissatisfied i am gonna go find another attorney so give me my file see you and i went shopping around for a new attorney and it took me about seven before um pardon me seven attorneys before i found one that was adequate in terms of knowledge of head injury and brain injury because his father was a neurosurgeon and uh he had experience and expertise in uh bringing up the uh the differences uh and the realities of of a brain injury ah and the effects the lifelong effects you know so after the two years we got in uh just under the two years so i mean hell that would be what it happened in ninety three so just under december ninety five uh the day the last day of ah the statute running out we filed so we got it filed once it was filed the judge ah scheduled a hearing and for whatever stupid reason um the soonest they could hear the case was one year from the date that we filed so you can see when you get into bed with you know and involved in the legal system in terms of filing a multimillion dollar lawsuit or whatever you know any kind of lawsuit uh the big boys get all the breaks so ah in my opinion the judge did not wanna hear the case before then or maybe his docket was full but i am saying you know there is no prioritization in the legal system there are some things that uh should be addressed soon uh i should not have to wait that long but so then came down to one week prior to the uh hearing and i got a letter from my attorney and he said that uh and also a phone call from the office saying that uh um that they uh were filing a continuance which meant that uh the judge granted them an additional year of discovery um whatever the law says you know the judge says he has to back it up but so that postponed the trial for another year which pissed me off you know but that is exactly what they were planning on you know wearing me down like i said knowing that i do not have the money to throw in there and say hey you know um but they know full well that we had all the evidence that we had too so ah that just postponed it for another year finally we got into uh coming in and then they ah sent a letter saying they wanted to meet uh for arbitration to see if they we could hammer out some kind of settlement couple months before the trial uh i was unaware of this common practice but you know it was very iffy situation um juries here uh in columbus have been mm ultra conservative uh they feel that people for some reason or another that people that have been legitimately injured and their lives have been affected that they do not deserve money for whatever reason um and it do not think it is fair that they can sit back and be that conservative if it has not happened to them i do not think that is fair um because it does affect your entire has otherwise i would be full time employed i would be gainfully employed making money and i am not and that is that is not because of anything uh it is by choices on my part but it is it is uh you know there is a lot that there is a lot there the betrayal that i have had to struggle with there is a lot there that um you know i felt i have been betrayed by everybody that taught me i feel betrayed by the the government by the legal system by the politicians by all the people that have been put in charge to protect people to protect ideals to protect principles throw it out the window for money and then when it comes down to me being legitimately hurt um it got down to just ah dollars and cents bartering for what my life was worth and it is the bidding started at a hundred twenty five thousand dollars i feel i am worth more than that you know i feel like you can not put a value on a human life um you know there were just subtle things that you know my sense of taste and smell was gone for about a year and a half ah just all the trauma that goes involved with it not just not just the physical trauma i mean that was enough to kill anybody but because of me because of my size because of my strength uh i was not killed you know um so the physical burden i was still dealing with a lot of the physical pain uh it is gotten significantly less but uh the emotional pain was worse and is worse um having to have a you know a lack of money now means lack of socializing means lack of going and doing things um you know do not have any lot of relationships do not have a girlfriend do not have a wife do not nothing like that i have got a dog a golden retriever

shopping you know but it is just become a really good metropolitan city i mean it is on it is way 

Recording: (8339/ 9621) 
like people too like when people order a bunch of crap i just want to tell them i am like no do not do that like 

Recording: (8340/ 9621) 
to melt and soften the metal so they could work with it um yes the air would help increase the temperature but a fire kept for a long period of time will be hotter than any kind of fire you have ever touched or been around and that fire is sacred it is a sacred fire uh so that is why it is possible but if it if i went down there with the laws of physics told me that those rocks could not sustain heat yet i see when the fire keeper breaks them out of the out of the fire pit and brings them into the sweat lodge that they are red orange glowing you gonna tell me they are not hot so that is that is one example um 

Recording: (8341/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8342/ 9621) 
you know and they work hard you know to make it easier on the students you know totally restructured the place since the beginning of the year

Recording: (8344/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> i think he needs counseling AT that point <LAUGH>

Recording: (8353/ 9621) 
yeah i did 

Recording: (8354/ 9621) 
really i have not noticed that yet huh 

Recording: (8355/ 9621) 
that must be 

Recording: (8356/ 9621) 
not directly but indirectly so i certainly did not want to be elected 

Recording: (8357/ 9621) 
um either role playing games 

Recording: (8358/ 9621)

Recording: (8362/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (8363/ 9621) 
oh yeah almost always does not matter what um the disability is AND I do not know why this is but they used to say eight to one now they are saying more like five to one does not matter if it is a speech impediment blindness retardation cerebral palsy deafness learning you name it there is five to one more boys than there are girls and we do not know why 

Recording: (8364/ 9621) 
four five 

Recording: (8365/ 9621) 
well at the time when they were having a lot of trouble at school and they just wanted to get rid of some people 

Recording: (8366/ 9621) 
i am waiting for it <LAUGH> i do not know what i am gonna do but i am waiting for it <LAUGH> 

Recording: (8367/ 9621) 
yet they pray a prayer every sunday we believe in the seen and the unseen i will never forget it because i recited it for god knows how many years but when you talk to them about possession when you talk to them about demons or spirits they freak out 

Recording: (8368/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8369/ 9621) 
um-hum um-hum that uh it it was like i say i said she probably probably thinks the same way you know she would been here you know and having trouble with boys and everything you know when she was growing up but not probably would have could have probably would have been an ass about that kind of stuff you would think i am not how bad they were you know if they laid a hand on her of course you know but but uh um but by her being away you know then and her mom is got a cool head on her shoulders she would not let that happen unless she told me about it then she would be probably be afraid tell me that i would catch an airplane flight over there or something you know fuck the guy up or something 

Recording: (8370/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (8371/ 9621)

Recording: (8373/ 9621) 
our school was not really a violent one there were not really any fights or anything 

Recording: (8374/ 9621) 
and so i think it gets driven home i think the media does that in a lotta places they pick something that is sensational and keep they are making it even more sensational like when uh uh john kennedy died 

Recording: (8375/ 9621) 
watertown waterbury 

Recording: (8376/ 9621)

just from doing that but when you have a dog why bother um and they will not allow dogs so SHES not allowed to go over there so she is always like BUT but it does make a big difference so i guess that is what i am saying for them 

Recording: (8388/ 9621) 
yeah that is uh the the bureaucracy it would be too much of a struggle i think 

Recording: (8389/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8390/ 9621) 
you know so they offered to accept me to med school here 

Recording: (8391/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8392/ 9621) 
it is the art school 

Recording: (8393/ 9621) 
ah 

Recording: (8394/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (8395/ 9621) 
i have heard some of them talk about it 

Recording: (8396/ 9621) 
so i do not know maybe it is a little bit more dangerous um but i think that comes with the with a bigger city when you get more people there is obviously gonna be some more problems um and uh i mean that is really that is really all that i know so it is obviously a lot more build up it is gotten a lot more commercial things like city center and 

Recording: (8397/ 9621) 
and that that makes sense and a lot of the new ballparks are made smaller so they can hit home runs because that attracts fans people go nuts people would rather see a tight game that was like seven to like six rather than watch like uh a two to one ball game 

Recording: (8398/ 9621) 
real positive about it but basically i i lived here for for my whole life and i grew up on campus and 

Recording: (8399/ 9621) 
i thought was forty three 

Recording: (8400/ 9621) 
you puke up 

Recording: (8401/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> uh-huh 

Recording: (8402/ 9621)

Recording: (8404/ 9621) 
throw nerf balls in the audience and <LAUGH> 

Recording: (8405/ 9621) 
as to what the sanctuary should be like <LAUGH> so we had a tour uh the choir took a tour our choir director um arranged it to about six five or six churches in the columbus area to sing in them and not for an audience but just to sing and to see which ones we liked the acoustics of and uh that was interesting we sang in uh we sang in central presbyterian church downtown which was where this my one of my orchestras plays a lot and uh we sang in other different kinds of churches and said what we liked about them what we did not <LAUGH> maybe it had some feedback i think the new building is acoustically very good it is certainly much better than old worship center because i do not know if you have seen a picture or anything of the church the old worship center was designed by a modern architect to be a modern quote unquote type building in nineteen sixty and it is YEAH <LAUGH> it is it is flat there is a flat roof with a clear story in the middle it has nothing in just it is just empty space over the over the worship center so when you would sing in that as a choir you spread out along the front if you were under the high place your voice would go all of the way to the back but if you were under this flat ceiling that is only about seven or that is only about nine or ten feet high it was dead> it was just muffled <LAUGH> and um it was terrible acoustically <LAUGH> but you know we made do with it for many years and then um and then we had the the chance to get this input into this new building and it is it is uh it is really beautiful it is a circular almost circular big uh space with a high point in the middle of the roof and uh it is it is nice <LAUGH> well you could still go it is they will not have they will not have a lot of um 

Recording: (8406/ 9621) 
so yeah those places were probably about thirty years old i no fire hazards insulation just you know fire hazard everywhere 

Recording: (8407/ 9621) 
right and i think that you know i think that it is just because you know you do so because i know i have done studies and i took some of those classes and you just think about it that way and i think a lot of these people just you know they say the nurse says something you take everything for a fact and i thought that was kinda strange but i mean i think there is a lot of things that are probably positive enough about it that it i would want to do it for for a while as long as i could 

Recording: (8408/ 9621) 
uh well yeah well librarians traditionally have problems with and it is like a form of censorship you know big brother things librarians have always had problems with that uh i i do not know it is it is hard to balance it if somebody is out there actually doing criminal work criminal activity and causing damage you want to know about it but how do you do that and still protect the rights of everybody else it is i do not know how to balance it 

Recording: (8409/ 9621) 
um as far as my brother goes I CANT say i REALLY see my brother too often um he does live in town um but usually he is either at work because he works fulltime then he has he is a part time student columbus state um so i do not really see him during the day and then at night he usually goes out does his thing i go out and do my thing so i mean as far as what is going on with him i really do not know but i know i mean there is nothing real serious GOING ON with him or anything like that

Recording: (8415/ 9621) 
i know steve my sometimes i mean we have taken joey out to the cemetery a few times to go to the gravesite of his father and he says you know very often boy she would really liked to have been here and done things with him

Recording: (8451/ 9621) 
we are in the same age range 

Recording: (8452/ 9621) 
i really did not because i felt like i was in love with these boys yeah 

Recording: (8453/ 9621) 
and they the high explosive shells had thirty seven pounds of t n t in them so they would make quite a bang when they went off 

Recording: (8454/ 9621) 
that you really did not need because then you could get more bang for your bucks 

Recording: (8455/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (8456/ 9621) 
that is good no not really actually some i have and then i have run into the people that just like anything they wanna get out of their hometown they do not like it they complain but normally i find that those people are not taking advantage of the you know free art shows and you know i mean the things that are free i am like oh have you done this no i did not even know about it and you have lived here all your life and i have only lived here x number of years and 

Recording: (8457/ 9621) 
at each other is throat for this that and the other and and you know devon is uh my daughter is the one that really got put in the middle of it you know and probably it was a blessing that they moved to saint louis because there probably could have been more uh problems legal problems you know as far as uh going back and forth to court and putting her on the witness stand for stupid stuff you know and so uh in hindsight it was kind of a blessing that they moved there 

Recording: (8458/ 9621) 
yeah that blocks out all that uh extraneous stuff that is trying to pull you away 

Recording: (8459/ 9621) 
i do not have money and when i start dating people i have i have extremely expensive tastes for women and i like wine and dining people i love the opera and that gets real a while gets real expensive after a while uh i am taking one class i am taking uh an accounting class <LAUGH> i had a real big mess academically um graduated high school with three five it was all college prep classes a p courses i got a really high i q extremely intelligent all through high school i was just coasting on that intellect i would go in take an exam bing bang go out get an a would not even study for it i think i studied as much my senior year as i did my freshman year for one midterm <LAUGH> or <LAUGH> or one final and uh that just did not work when i got to college but i did not know that until i was done with my freshman year with a one point seven g p a about uh about see the middle of winter quarter i realized why i was in engineering i had applied three colleges my senior year of high school ohio state on a whim from my dad who told me to apply there because i could get in without any trouble whatsoever naval academy and the air force academy now naval academy air force academy and west point are three of the top ten hardest schools in the world to get into you get into one of those academies and you are coming out as an engineer that is what they all are i mean yeah there is other there is other field but the vast majority are engineers i like math and science so i figure oh engineering i do not have any other options i must be engineering so i came to college and i got into the honors engineering freshman freshman honors engineering program called the gateway program engineering is the hardest field to study aside probably from law or medicine and i went into the honors program that was a big mistake really really big mistake i got to college and it just went downhill i had all that freedom and i had no clue how to study and it just went to hell in a hand basket summer um spring quarter i switched my major to music because i am extremely musically inclined it is one of the gifts that i have gotten and um that uh that i discovered is very similar to acting which i love to do but i realized that just like acting you are all good ninety five percent of you are poor as dirt three percent of you are right in the middle and two percent of you are extremely wealthy and the vast majority like i said ninety five percent are dirt poor you know i do not want to do that i mean i i my dad is a doctor i was raised in high society i do not want to leave high society i like it there <LAUGH> i like it there a lot yeah and um so i was like i better get out of better get out of the music thing so i decided to go into business but um i can not get into business until i get a a bunch prerequisite courses out of the way because my g p a is it is i in after this quarter i did really good this quarter after this quarter it is up to a two two and i am not gonna be able to get into the business school until i have got a bunch prerequisites out of the way and they are sequences i can not take accounting two twelve until i am done with two eleven i can not take c i s two hundred and two o one until i am done with two hundred and all that junk so i had to take this stupid class this summer because if i am gonna get in when i want to um i have you know i hafta take it this summer i hate taking classes in summer when i am well because i would rather just i would rather just work and and not worry about the classes and then have all sorts of fun all summer long with all my friends but it is not gonna work yeah rest my brain a little bit but i am still searching for a job it is not that i can not find jobs it is just that i can not find the one i want i mean the job market is huge down here in columbus i mean i want a job right around nine ten dollars an hour so i can get a full forty hour week and they will not have a problem with me leaving at five oclock because i have a class at five thirty but that is what i am doing this summer i am still searching for a job i would have i would have done some more searching today but i have had a few problems with my satanic computer stupid 

Recording: (8460/ 9621) 
uh yeah it would be just one more thing 

Recording: (8461/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8462/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (8463/ 9621) 
yeah no problem 

Recording: (8464/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (8465/ 9621) 
i do not have a good opinion of uh columbus schools at all no not at all 

Recording: (8466/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8467/ 9621) 
oh was HORRIBLE IT WAS A HORRIBLE because you watch it and you think uh oh my god 

Recording: (8468/ 9621) 
yeah that is what i mean they go by your age too 

Recording: (8469/ 9621) 
just because it is been three weeks now you know and not only that there is uh something in the deal like they lose their benefits after two weeks and the union has to pay their full wages for the work that they miss 

Recording: (8470/ 9621) 
right um-hum 

Recording: (8471/ 9621) 
um-hum it is kind of frustrating but i am i it is a it is probably good for me because i am so it is hard for me to just sit back and let other people believe whatever they want TO BELIEVE you know i just want to convince them but i can not do that so it is a good exercise for me i look at it that way and just letting them go ahead and 

Recording: (8472/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (8473/ 9621) 
i do not have a bloody clue to be perfectly honest with you i just noticed that it continued to decline all through high school and i was like yeah you should get out before you actually fail the class <LAUGH> and um it was it was just unpleasant i think i was stupid i think that is what it amounts to not that i was not able to pick up the data i was just um that is uh unwise in in whether or not it was worth while and i believe that it is uh horribly worth while now and yet now i am not taking classes so 

Recording: (8474/ 9621) 
to deal with 

Recording: (8475/ 9621) 
mean the way i grew up it was probably like back in the day like the catholics against the columbus publics you know like the richies against the poories that is how i kind of see it but when i went to northland people were think northland is like a rich school but the way i see it is no not really i mean we do live in a big you know housed area you know the houses are like huge but um um i mean columbus public they they got some work to do too like the other night i was watching tv and uh an elementary school overdosed a kid on like some a i think it was a drug to calm him down so he is not so hyper and they like overdosed him like twice in a day and then when he goes home his mom is even overdosing him because he they are overdosing him 

Recording: (8476/ 9621) 
and we monitor what they watch television wise we do a lot of library things get them to the library a couple days a week try to keep them interested in books and 

Recording: (8477/ 9621) 
sure 

Recording: (8478/ 9621) 
yeah oh yeah the five year old just after her the whole time the minute she walks in the door you know 

Recording: (8479/ 9621) 
yeah it is the brady bill did not really do it for america like they thought i mean yeah you wait five days big deal go out on twentieth avenue and pick one up in five minutes you know <LAUGH> i have seen all kinds of people carry guns that should not 

Recording: (8480/ 9621) 
but eventually it went away i just i just because i would get stressed out and start crying and go crazy you know <LAUGH> 

Recording: (8481/ 9621) 
hum um 

Recording: (8482/ 9621) 
um and it was nice uh just seeing that and you could tell they were still in love and everything and you know one of them had four children one had like six you know i mean it was amazing because i thought i bet they are not still married getting right out of high school i just was not interested in that when i was in high school at all you know i was ready to go out into the world and these girls who get married so young they just have no clue about life 

Recording: (8483/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (8484/ 9621) 
i delivered the columbus dispatch in the morning too so

Recording: (8488/ 9621) 
uh oh yes yes 

Recording: (8489/ 9621) 
we were talking about this at work one day and they said you know i am surprised you think that way because i tend to be a little left of center on most things sometimes far left but and i said now this is not i she said seems like that would be the conservative view my opinion the conservative view is they do not want him to go back to cuba not to the communism or but people i have talked to even extreme conservatives and liberals they all pretty much feel the same way that the ones i have i have not heard anybody 

Recording: (8490/ 9621) 
and my youngest daughter when i was crabbing about it because i said i talked to them and they said well we are coming to ohio in a couple weeks and i said oh good are you gonna come and see us um well no we were not we were not planning on it and i said well why well we are we are not driving uh doty is renting us the car well all that meant was my sister was renting the car but he was driving the car yeah i said well well well then how are you gonna get to these other places and normally i would not do that i would just let it go well uh uh uh doty is renting that car and i said well are you are not you driving it well well yeah but and i said fine and i do not wanna even think about it so it is kind of like 

Recording: (8491/ 9621) 
well i believe that is way it was originally set up you know so 

Recording: (8492/ 9621) 
huh well i am not the mayor or anything so i am not gonna make any promises <LAUGH> 

Recording: (8493/ 9621)

he is like this robot 

Recording: (8496/ 9621) 
yeah i am at the end of it all 

Recording: (8497/ 9621) 
but then it is like it some evil person back there in the screening room puts some of this junk in there right in the middle and then you go you can not stop and not watch that you KNOW you and if i was in charge of it i would cut some of it out it is NOT THAT IMPORTANT <LAUGH> 

Recording: (8498/ 9621) 
oh probably my family my kids are here i have a grandchild now so yeah i like to stay close to all them 

Recording: (8499/ 9621) 
why do not you live for a year no not do it for a year just go down for the day and then come back to upper arlington night and live how would you like do that hm 

Recording: (8500/ 9621)

Recording: (8501/ 9621) 
very slow very methodical we take them to my husbands taken them many times for when they had to have cataract operations you know so he is involved with the girls too 

Recording: (8502/ 9621) 
i do not know that is so controversial i mean i mean to the point i mean they show them how to put condoms on bananas in public schools and it is like well are you promoting sex then or do i uh 

Recording: (8503/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8504/ 9621) 
well like i am a philosophy minor so like if you look at like different ethical theories and stuff like like there is a hierarchy kind of this is what i have found there is a hierarchy of things that are uh like the inalienable rights for instance like i can not if you come into my house and rob me and then run outside i am notgonna i like to kill you for stealing my property like there is a hierarchy there uh for stealing another life that is why people say oh you can do it so but i really feel like there is nothing like if i if it is inalienable the definition is it is not able to be taken not even by yourself that is why you can not commit suicide and since it is the highest thing because without it you can not even do the others it is so it naturally has to be higher ordered than the others because without that you can not do the you can not be ethical in any other way so that has to be the highest thing and if it is inalienable because i did not give it to you i can not take it back you never forfeited that you never gave me that right so that is why i feel like i could never want that in to kill another person or 

Recording: (8505/ 9621) 
but it kind of helps actually because uh you have all the people in there who are not honors and they do not know how to like the partiers they do not know how to study or anything so 

Recording: (8506/ 9621) 
oh i see

Recording: (8514/ 9621)

Recording: (8539/ 9621) 
um do you know um a group called um midnight oil yeah <LAUGH> they are pretty good i like them yeah 

Recording: (8540/ 9621) 
um sector and i think that is a good sign but i think there is a huge there is millions of children that do not have any healthcare and that is not right there is like there is a lot of like between the lower and the upper there is a huge disparity but at least it is a step in the right direction we have a a nice solid middle middle middle income base i think because a lot of countries only have the like i visited mexico and seems like they only had the distinction between the upper and lower i mean their middle class is very small and that uh but that economy is coming along too and i mean it it will be it is developing itself which is which is nice i took a tour of a plant down there cause my my old my old man had business down there so i went down just to see it and like it it seems like it was coming along and they treat their workers better granted those workers make the equivalent of like seven bucks a day but they get they get bused into work because none of them have cars and then on top of that they all get a meal because there like like a hot meal like they have a cafeteria there because i was talking to the the one of the managers and he said if we do not do that then they will not be thinking about the our quality and they will be thinking about getting food and they will be hungry so it hurts our quality so for them it was worth it and i 

Recording: (8541/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8542/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8543/ 9621) 
um well like i said before i think i do not know i think screening would be very difficult i mean especially because at that age you are gonna have a lot of people who are you know people say things to say things and to get a reaction and to tell their friends that they said i mean you know they can play off whatever and unless they were you know 

Recording: (8544/ 9621) 
um-hum i do not know that they would use the INFORMATION if they had it <LAUGH> <LAUGH> i i do not know

i mean no crash or anything but was rather scared <LAUGH> kind of shaken up by it but um no they are very very serious about designated drivers 

Recording: (8546/ 9621) 
well most people think it is something they rely on like well the money getting from the lottery to the people or lottery to schools on that issue then yeah i i agree with the gambling thing you know just as long as it is like social drinking <LAUGH> in a sense because if you have people just go out like today i i bought a one dollar lottery ticket won two bucks off of it so i kept my one dollar and uh got a one dollar added on yeah there is <LAUGH> and then then there is these um little bit more expensive cards you buy the lottery cards one of them is called battleship that i have won lot of money off of 

Recording: (8547/ 9621)

Recording: (8556/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8557/ 9621) 
um <LAUGH> actually it is more it is almost actually turned into like a self business um like i said it started out with my dad and then people would ask me what i was doing i would tell them they would be like oh i have some things around the house that need to be done and so i would go there and they would tell people and 

Recording: (8558/ 9621) 
teachers couple teachers take a bunch a kid every couple years they go to a different country 

Recording: (8559/ 9621)

Recording: (8560/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8561/ 9621) 
i know <LAUGH> 

Recording: (8562/ 9621)

Recording: (8570/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (8571/ 9621) 
yeah she just likes to write stories and she is real creative that way 

Recording: (8572/ 9621) 
yeah yeah it would be good though because i could take care to the books and everything and do all that kind of thing so 

Recording: (8573/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8574/ 9621) 
no painting was needed uh well then then as a result they they went through and decided since i broke the lease to uh you know get some more money out of me and go ahead and repaint it anyway and they uh scratched out the first rating and changed it to a lower rating um and even though that evidence was in front of a magistrate 

Recording: (8575/ 9621) 
oh well that is unfortunate <LAUGH> 

Recording: (8576/ 9621) 
oh they do in ninth grade and by tenth grade and eleventh they are little more focused on the fact that they better get their act together because they are gonna have to go to college and this is like the only life they are gonna get you know they kind of get that realization they start getting serious kids at middle school think everything is just a big joke you know i am gonna play in a rock band you know they all think they are gonna be rock stars and drummers and and you know they could care less about anything it has not hit them yet this is my real life duh this is my one real life better not throw it away they waste time you know they lose stuff 

Recording: (8577/ 9621) 
yeah and and everybody is gonna associate with people that they feel comfortable with so you know and unfortunately as that guy this guy in particular he was a center for the football team as he grew up older you know uh he realized that he was not as big as important as he uh and he blew out his knee for a o u you know i went to i went to school with larry hunter who is the a basketball coach for uh o u now and uh and he had the same thing happen to him uh he had uh scholarship for o u and both of his knees are shot and everything but uh and he was a good ballplayer probably one best ones i ever seen and uh rivalled like a larry byrd you know back in that day and everything and uh but one heck of a nice guy you know never let it get to him 

Recording: (8578/ 9621) 
yeah and that like i do notknow that state is notorious for killing people i think they killed someone last night 

Recording: (8579/ 9621) 
i think um the people who have already graduated they are like the doctors and the the dentists and all the people who went here have a really good reputation like among adults it is just that the kids want to go it it is just thought of as a somewhat party school 

Recording: (8580/ 9621) 
but i do believe if you know when you are in love and you love somebody you will not you will not cheat on them 

Recording: (8581/ 9621) 
uh um-hum 

Recording: (8582/ 9621) 
that i wanted them to file charges on him and they said well no uh he is not met the criteria i said well he does not get to school sometimes until lunchtime <LAUGH> they said well he gets here just in time to not be counted um tardy or not tardy but 

Recording: (8583/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8584/ 9621) 
do not realize it 

Recording: (8585/ 9621) 
yeah that is right when you are that was your question are we gonna have doom we are gonna have a catastrophe we gonna get this thing turned around before we have yes uh i think we will uh but i do not think we are ready to turn around yet i think we are still well this mass communication that she has alluded to three or four five times i uh it it is coming upon us so rapidly i strongly predict that in just twenty years and possibly ten each and every one of us in the world are gonna be interconnected with one another but once again its an impersonal uh inner connection i can i will be able to contact you when you are over in paris and i will be over in in ohio and out there on the farm and i am probably watching the geese swimming up and down the little lake and you are sitting over there in paris having a uh coffee something something yeah it DOES <LAUGH>

fastest sucker on those braces 

Recording: (8587/ 9621)

Recording: (8593/ 9621) 
some of them transfer from up north and out east and indiana and just different walks of life you know 

Recording: (8594/ 9621) 
and i just can not imagine i had dogs and cats we did and i loved it and i just think kids need that and it is just a different kind of love i think you know they learn from it and 

Recording: (8595/ 9621) 
um probably would have been about six years ago i would been in sixth or seventh grade 

Recording: (8596/ 9621) 
i did have a a part time job i loved it it was just four hours a day but they wanted me to go full time and i just did not feel like i wanted to go full time so i was working as a receptionist and uh answering the phone doing some light filing just a variety of tasks office type tasks and i really liked it i liked the hours but i did not want to go eight hours compared to four so i left 

Recording: (8597/ 9621) 
and it is it is one color text no pictures people always ask you what things look like and then you do not can not tell them and two it is like the computers are all screwed up like you type in you will like type in computers and it will say we do not have them but we obviously do and like then you will look at it a different way and you will be able to find them like it is uh it is really weird like i do not understand 

Recording: (8598/ 9621) 
are you sure i 

Recording: (8599/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (8600/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8601/ 9621) 
i think there is a heck of a lot more to it then what we will probably ever know um you know they really have not checked into the background of the parents you know they are still what their beliefs were and everything uh and i think that is a shame because you know you mentioned it before about something accidentally where uh some kid shoots another kid you know and then the parents are are responsible for it and everything you know these two kids deliberately went in to kill and they wanted to kill more than what they killed uh then they killed themselves so we will never know from their endpoint why they did it but i think there is got to be something that we could find out from you know uh from their parents as to how they lived you know they could have been anything you know they could have been down there they could have been making him making him do it you know 

Recording: (8602/ 9621) 
i am from here columbus ohio yeah

i uh his wife is a teacher and i understand an excellent teacher so i think he has real good information um that he works with well i think she maybe uh retired last year but she had taught columbus for twenty years or something like that and so i think his information is good but i guess <LAUGH> THE way HE handles things sometimes gets THROUGH <LAUGH> 

Recording: (8614/ 9621) 
product certain things but they they want everything to be the same they can not be they can not be the same it is just a natural thing but the thing is let them do what they can that is a god given talent what you have there okay nurse and how many refuse the nurse voluntarily when they have children why talking among you women folk why do you have well i do not want to you have the natural ability to give all the all the natural protein the immunization things all that maternal milk why can not you instead of getting off the shelf

Recording: (8628/ 9621) 
it is so dirty i wish they would clean it up more um uh when i first started working for the courier service i really really hated one way streets but once you get the hang of it they are a blessing because you are in downtown and all of a sudden ding ding ding ding ding ding ding you see like twelve green lights in a row you are just like you go as fast as you can and try and get through all of them all at the same time now mind you if you are doing that anytime during the day that will not happen because you have got cars all around you but at night it is pretty fun and you just floor it and fly right through the middle of down town um improvements i would just say keep i would just say that man this place is dirty 

Recording: (8629/ 9621)

it was we had a little gallery um we were in clintonville for a a year or so and then we moved to grandview and it was just fine art we called it fine art crafts and it was handmaid stuff from local people and we had lot of jewelry and pottery and silk and paintings that kind stuff 

Recording: (8635/ 9621) 
you know he says that e equals m c squared i say it is e equals m c cubed because the the world is three dimensional it is not two dimensional uh two dimensional limits everything but you look at his theory of relativity all of our mathematical theorems physical theorems on physics and things of that nature have been based off that 

Recording: (8636/ 9621) 
no i think we are only friends inside the class i mean a lot of them i have known um from middle school and following them up and you know they just all go their different ways like the one girl i was friends with at world park i mean she was a grade lower than me but when that we seen each other in the halls like hey what is up and and we would talk and you know what is going on and we are doing this after school and that in high school i did not know anything i i know she was bad <LAUGH> and that was it <LAUGH> 

Recording: (8637/ 9621) 
uh no that is okay i ya know do not i just do not want to touch it i just 

Recording: (8638/ 9621) 
it was just like that i am telling you it was and we would see you know they would put things on the on the screen for us to watch i i mean i learned a lot of stuff it was very a very good experience i went through very good 

Recording: (8639/ 9621) 
well i do not really like the uh i do not i really do not like that job but uh you know i like the people there but it is like uh way too busy i think

Recording: (8642/ 9621) 
that would be good 

Recording: (8643/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (8644/ 9621) 
oh i do not really THINK so i think of myself as kind of an impatient person but i guess i do not i guess i do not i do not get as shocked by some of the things they do as some people do and i do not yell and scream at them i mean realize they did not ask to have a learning disability i mean they and that they can not they are not some teachers think they are just being belligerent and that if they wanted to straighten up they could and what i try to tell those teachers is they can not change their learning disability anymore than you can change your brown eyes you know they were born with it it is genetic someone else in their family has it they can learn they just do not learn the same way everybody else does you have to break it down into pieces or teach it a different way it is like teaching a math problem two different ways you get the same answer but one way works better for you well that is how they are you know maybe they do not learn well by listening maybe they do not learn by well by looking at a chart or something maybe they only learn well when they are up moving around doing something you know you just have to understand that their avenues of learning are like different than yours and totally some of them might be totally screwed up like they might hear half of what you say or they might jumble up what you say you say turn to page three ninety three or and they turn to three thirty nine in their book you know and they think they did what you said it is just like something is mixed up between the actual eye and the ear and then it where it gets interpreted into the brain it gets all scrambled somehow and i i always tell teachers if you could just walk uh for one day in their shoes you would probably have a lot of empathy for them 

Recording: (8645/ 9621) 
YEAH 

Recording: (8646/ 9621)

Recording: (8729/ 9621) 
i will raise him the best way i can 

Recording: (8730/ 9621) 
during the depression my grandfather um moved over here and then asked her 

Recording: (8731/ 9621) 
ready willing to do that again 

Recording: (8732/ 9621) 
right right <LAUGH> 

Recording: (8733/ 9621) 
yeah it is like the uh the woman that useta live in the apartment where we lived before us see she had a husband she was married too for quite some time he got on ohio is number one d u i list with eighteen d u i is man can you imagine how much money he is put into that i mean you think your first d u i offense would be about a thousand dollar fine and weekend in jail or something but eighteen of them and you are racking up all that money and all those legal bills and all that time i think he is in jail now 

Recording: (8734/ 9621) 
civil rights um well i i take the extreme position that civil rights are an illusion um yeah they are on paper which is a good thing because it was a terrible thing when uh there were laws that restricted someone because of their ethnic background or because of their gender but i think in many ways it has had little effect on creating an equal and fair society um some my leftist positions will come out right now um people have the freedom but i believe that based upon where where in the social stratum where you were born in the united states uh you have a a limited ability to move upward and that the these cla i mean i i do not want to say class lines because that has so many like historical connotations cause it is not the exact same as say class was in the marx is sense but class lines still today very much um follow race lines and what good is like knowing that you have the freedom to vote when you know painfully well that you are not going to be able to get a job that is gonna buy a house for your family and let them live in a relative comfort i mean in real terms in things i think are valuable to the individual 

Recording: (8735/ 9621) 
yeah for everybody so it is kind of a really big deal and my parents are the oldest from from their families too so it is the first great grandchild and and with um my husband he is it is him> he is the oldest so for everybody 

Recording: (8736/ 9621) 
i do not know where i am going to fly into honestly i am thinking of doing a courier flight 

Recording: (8737/ 9621) 
so yeah 

Recording: (8738/ 9621) 
her limited very limited 

Recording: (8739/ 9621) 
it is an island but a planet together i liked it there i kinda like and i figure they will probably hook up but i do not like how the show this show and this happened with deep space nine two and even with next generation for a little bit how the show is become soap opera like um i mean the romantic aspects of the stories do not really appeal to me very much um i am more interested in the social things and you know good old special effects um but i i think i like that how it is kept with a sort of i tension and it is not like they are not completely thrown together like uh belanna and tom which i do not like that at all 

Recording: (8740/ 9621) 
better than that much dirt AND UH so uh whenever they we heard any firing like it was coming toward us why we would <LAUGH> head for that hole 

Recording: (8741/ 9621) 
i have a five hour course the first term of summer quarter 

Recording: (8742/ 9621) 
yes yes you might make millions you could retire YOUNG <LAUGH> really 

Recording: (8743/ 9621) 
is that right 

Recording: (8744/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8745/ 9621) 
i did not know that 

Recording: (8746/ 9621) 
totally left that part out no one filled me in about no throwing up or anything that that really made me MAD <LAUGH> 

Recording: (8747/ 9621) 
i just think it is a different time now i do not think i think everybody is living more for today and talking about the future you know hoping that the future is there i think there is a quote unquote uh in time aspect to life you know 

Recording: (8748/ 9621) 
you know now 

Recording: (8749/ 9621) 
okay good 

Recording: (8750/ 9621) 
like trying to cram organic into my head and 

Recording: (8751/ 9621) 
what did you spend most of your time doing besides snorkeling 

Recording: (8752/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8753/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8754/ 9621) 
but you understand what i am saying it is you gonna have to make make it so the guns that you got are harder to conceal 

Recording: (8755/ 9621) 
YEAH 

Recording: (8756/ 9621) 
right right and that yeah and again if it is criminal activity you want you want somebody to stop it and know about it but if it is i am not doing anything i want anybody to know about yeah and then what is to prevent them from going and finding out what some companies doing what research is and that is the part that is a threat on the web too is that you can connect in somebody is system and they do not know that you are there and you can see what they are doing if they are doing research uh you know developing a new product or something you can yeah it is corporate espionage and i am sure that is going on and i have heard cases of it yeah well and the thing is people are real sharp and no matter what you do they will find a way you know it is nobody is found a way to prevent people from getting in and people are real good about finding new ways to do it 

Recording: (8757/ 9621) 
but it it is teaching him discipline responsibility you can not do these things at this time you know i 

Recording: (8758/ 9621) 
i i am sure it makes it easier but i think that a person can establish a relationship ey you just have to put the effort into it and decide to have that relationship and so i think that even if i were working you know with my oldest daughter i worked but i arranged my life around her so that even though i had that degree i waited tables because when she was little before she started school i could go to work at five in the evening and she went to bed at seven thirty so i had her was with her all day then when she started school i switched over to lunches and so i have always arranged my life around my children so i have an opportunity to be with them 

Recording: (8759/ 9621) 
well they were none of my friends that were pregnant and i am not sure they you know i just remember couple girls that were pregnant i do not i were not was not friends with them and i am not sure about who their boyfriends were or anything like that

Recording: (8762/ 9621) 
my father moved here yes 

Recording: (8763/ 9621) 
um but the trouble is we do not fit the horse with the proper carriage load and we need to do that in our society we need to work as a team there is no sense in having having five guards on a basketball team if you do not have a center that can tip it off and rebound 

Recording: (8764/ 9621) 
yeah yeah they do 

Recording: (8765/ 9621) 
well i it starts with with allowing uh heather has two mommies 

Recording: (8766/ 9621) 
yeah i think basically normal hours would be like eight to twelve and then you go home during lunch time because that is the big meal of day you go home and eat with your family that is really important 

Recording: (8767/ 9621) 
it is just a rule 

Recording: (8768/ 9621) 
there was this one guy had a so i do not know how many several herds of sheep and he would hire uh i think they were mexicans 

Recording: (8769/ 9621) 
so it is very part time and i am full time student so i was working somewhere else before but it it was i needed somewhere on campus 

Recording: (8770/ 9621) 
where she works and this is just o s u is breast cancer place so 

Recording: (8771/ 9621) 
you just keep going that is part of life you pick up something you learn it and you keep going 

Recording: (8772/ 9621) 
ai not no way 

Recording: (8773/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8774/ 9621)

Recording: (8775/ 9621) 
um yeah across streets the dental and the hospital so people were really loud down there 

Recording: (8776/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (8777/ 9621) 
mm basically they did not legally adopt him or anything but they are the ones that he considers his family really and i mean he still keeps in contact with his mom and his dad but it is always kind of a CHALLENGE 

Recording: (8778/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (8779/ 9621) 
why are you doing it now but and then my my my youngest one she likes to dress totally different she is sort of like uh little bit of a preppy but she uh does not understand why people want to have like izod on their shirt or you know a name on their pants and she says i just think that is stupid she says you can buy nice clothes without that so she is neither one of them pressure me and uh the one thing that was really odd when they little is we would go like to toys r us and up and down the rows and i see kids it is like in y you know and they would walk over and pick something up and go and then put it back down and keep walking and it is like you know i told joyce i says you know i feel like i am an ogre because are they terrified to even ask for this stuff and she goes no she says they do not want it she says they just want to see what it is like you know because their favorite toy when they were little is i would go to um um what do you call it lazy boy and get five or six of them killer boxes from the sofas and the chairs and take a knife and cut doors in it and they would play with that for weeks you know until somebody one of their friends would come over and have a little accident and then we go well we hafta build a new house but you know they just reading and playing with stuff like that they they enjoyed you know so 

Recording: (8780/ 9621) 
oh okay 

Recording: (8781/ 9621) 
it is okay 

Recording: (8782/ 9621)

Recording: (8783/ 9621) 
so i was like in shape very well <LAUGH> i was in very good shape 

Recording: (8784/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8785/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8786/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (8787/ 9621) 
um so i mean basically my opinion on that is just leave it up to them i mean if they wanna take the risks obviously they know <LAUGH> 

Recording: (8788/ 9621) 
no they should talk about i think they should talk about that too um i never i never did it and i you know wish i could have waited till i was married but i you know you are going through that whatever you go through when you are a teenager so you are like so what well most kids i am not you know some people some kids still do that but i think i yes i do think they should put that in it also that 

Recording: (8789/ 9621) 
i work at uh company plus i help out at the b v a vietnam veteran is association 

Recording: (8790/ 9621) 
yes and no i mean in high school it was a bunch of little things here it is not so much a lot of things 

Recording: (8791/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (8792/ 9621) 
everybody needs to know that information for credit cards 

Recording: (8793/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (8794/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8795/ 9621) 
now this most of my paintings were completed uh before uh like nineteen ninety five nineteen ninety six before it came back out it was more of a thing like images from my childhood coming back out and now it is suddenly uh you hear about it more often so that is why i am a little funny but used to be impressed like i paint star wars 

Recording: (8796/ 9621) 
high on their horse yeah <LAUGH> some of them are too 

Recording: (8797/ 9621) 
yeah but i could i could imagine 

Recording: (8798/ 9621) 
i know exactly 

Recording: (8799/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (8800/ 9621) 
yeah so they adjusted that but then they did not have any way to um enforce that so 

Recording: (8801/ 9621) 
hopefully 

Recording: (8802/ 9621) 
with no i no i am definitely in favor of that i mean yes it is the the parents is the parent is supposed to do it and one would hope that the parent would get there before before the health class did but if the parent is not gonna get there this is the only way they are ever gonna find OUT 

Recording: (8803/ 9621) 
that is what we figure in a few years he will be fine it is just getting there it is been very difficult i mean there is times when we did not know where he was for a week at a week at a time he i was driving lane avenue once and saw him begging money on the street and that is it is it is hit pretty heavy load to go through it really is 

Recording: (8804/ 9621) 
mm 

Recording: (8805/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (8806/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8807/ 9621) 
in the meantime you know <LAUGH> you gotta pay the bills so i you know i am not sure what she wants to do she is had so many different kinds of jobs part time jobs though hum you know i am when she was younger like ten years ago she wanted to have her own talk show 

Recording: (8808/ 9621) 
but uh you know with people coming back later and saying that uh they changed their mind and stuff as the adoptive parents i would be concerned about that but that is not gonna happen in this case i do not think and the because of her age and this makes no sense to me the state law says that she has to have custody of the child for seventy two hours before she can give it up for adoption uh because of her age and it does not make any sense to me but so the you know they are talking to a social worker now to find out they do not want take the baby home because they are afraid of being too attached to it then and they do not think it is a good atmosphere for it because her mother smokes constantly her mother is alcoholic um they 

Recording: (8809/ 9621) 
because you do have to have a higher education most of the time to do anything these days so they definitely have to have their 

Recording: (8810/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8811/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (8812/ 9621) 
actually you can have well they usually go together some kids have learning disabilities without the a d h d and some have a d h d without the learning disability and some have both and you can have a d d without having the hyperactive part you can have attention deficit disorder with what they call hypo activity and that is the student that is kind of spacey and kind of dreamy and they never cause any trouble but they are kind of like out of touch with reality and they are always looking out the window and like they are the one that says i did not hear what what was the question and uh they are they are a d d and they can not quite focus and distract they can not screen out the distractions but because they are not hyper they are not always doing this and they are not bothering people they are kind of the they are the ones that usually get lost in the shuffle those are the kids that are real cooperative and they are always smiling they are kind of spaced out and daydreaming and and takes a long time to realize hey this kid can not focus but with the kid that is all over the place and doing a tapping this kids chair and the kid goes make him stop tapping my chair YKNOW you can see right away that he can not focus because when you are he asks you for help and you come over to explain something to him and he is like all over the place while you are explaining he is not listening you are trying to show him something he will not look at it you know it is like people often say a d d kids can not focus or can not attend to anything but what is really happening is they attend to everything 

Recording: (8813/ 9621) 
five starters what you major uh-huh needle pointing finger paints journalism and um medicine okay crosswords okay gives our uh younger people some mentors look after does not it and where are your scores and those oh i am oh gee i am just barely getting by passwords you know but that is the problem we have lack of standards no that is their right keep it private but no i wish those guys would just stop hey i am i am majoring in accounting i am majoring in finance i am majoring in business and i got three point five i got two point six oh and whatever the criteria is to play on the the team why are not you playing this week well i am i am still required to practice even though i can not play this week why can not you play it is the it is the rule what rule well if i do not make certain things during the week which is academic i still hafta perform uh sports wise make that commitment but if i do not fall if i fall through on that then i am off the team period but those are things that be brought up publicized more instead of saying well hey we brought this much ticket gate this month and he got this scores and this percentages and that we need to expand more on that so that the younger people have some better role model to look at and not just playing round ball or the the spiral we need to get them out there and say how you gonna perform in school ya know i am sure michael red is got some mentors out there they see guys wearing number five and whatever the number is and eight whatever it was okay they got there is a reason for it but what what is what is the other part of it we do not do that because why we do not wanna bring it up and we do not wanna bring some embarrassment possibly or but that is part of life when they get out in the real world i am talking about these guys some would be successful in terms of whomever and some will be successful in other people eyes but the thing is show the kids that are watching them hey there is more than sports sports is a by product here go to ohio state 

Recording: (8814/ 9621)

yes they do 

Recording: (8932/ 9621) 
and i do not know whether orrin did or not he is never said anything if he has but uh i think my attitude would be uh do not tell and you know uh the the guys that come out in a very vociferously in favor of uh publicizing it and all that i do not see what they expect to gain i mean if they they uh in fact i do not i do not think that they do gain anything by it 

Recording: (8933/ 9621) 
yeah so i am a new grandma <LAUGH> 

Recording: (8934/ 9621) 
i think the one of the things that we when when you are baptized is that you are really supposed to help other people to like if if somebody gives you a gift you wanna give it to someone else but it is easy a lot of times just to fall into the you know like mold of not letting anyone know what you believe and just so that they think well what are those weirdos you know they do not wear makeup or whatever but we we can wear makeup if we want <LAUGH> but so i think a lot of times people do fall in to sort of but i i was not raised mormon so i have a lot of my family and friends who are still not members of the church and also because it is so new to me that i am just you know i will talk about it with anybody and and and so and i am also not afraid of people who are not mormons because i think if you grow up like a member of the church and you might be more afraid of people that do not believe like you have been taught i think a lot of the you know we do not drink alcohol we do not there is a lot of restrictions i guess you call them restrictions but they are i feel like they are more just health codes just keep you healthy and so um it might be it is like if we if america you know we are we are used to being raised one way if we went to another country just kind of like you might wanna get to know the chinese people but you might not quite be a little timid about you know kind of thing but i i am not i do not have any of those barriers 

Recording: (8935/ 9621) 
well i mean 

Recording: (8936/ 9621)

when you are fifty five or or is it sixty two whatever age there is that age limitation and or you based upon age or disability or being out of town uh you are allowed so but routinely we have done the out i mean done the uh absentee over the years no going back to basic politicians i i i think we have uh i think the vast majority uh are truly good honest people they try to mean well i am i am concerned always that uh people who go into politics are in fine shape when they start but the tremendous influences are brought to bear that they never had had the opportunity to comprehend before they got there and they are just overwhelmed it it and i do not necessarily think it is a it is a a dishonesty it is like a tidal wave they get caught up and they can not resist the direction that is being put or they are being pushed 

Recording: (8939/ 9621) 
and now it is our turn to deal with the issues we see our parents we see this generation that all these things that are still popular it is that we do not look down on the sixties i mean i think the sixties sounded like a pretty fun time to live i would get into politics in a second um but those things are popularized but no we can not do it anymore because we got all these problems 

Recording: (8940/ 9621) 
oh i will come back i mean if you need me to

Recording: (8948/ 9621)

i was a baby you know under one <LAUGH> 

Recording: (8969/ 9621) 
there is too much information and too much change uh librarians se and this is against probably of the image of librarians are they are very very eager to embrace change uh internet came out and ya know and when it and when it got out of the area that was being used by universities or whatever for research that is what it was at first librarians were right there they wanted more and more and they wanted to figure out what they could do with it um when p c is we did not you know it was revolutionary when we announced we were gonna use i b m p c is for access to the system and we provide you software you can do some of the work that you used to doing but with us in your computer and it is like it was incredible that i mean we had trouble with the demand it was ya know like triple what we expected librarians were ready for it 

Recording: (8970/ 9621) 
and um it it is great we have been reengineered last eight years o dot downsizing and trying to fit the uh uh fit the i guess the attributes the person brings to work as opposed to not one of the problems i i see as an as an employer or as a supervisor manager a lot of times we have to promote because well the bureaucracy says you have to do this in order to get up there they do not take in consideration the attributes the person has and so now we are saying okay if you bring this attribute to the table and you can help the team out then why not reward you instead of putting you over here in let us say a managerial position which you really do not have any call for but you are there because the money only okay so we are trying to fit the attribute to the person compensate them accordingly which hey if i think we did that we would probably have more teachers 

Recording: (8971/ 9621) 
and why do not people use their time you know and it is free you know rather they get all tensed up and mad because they left five minutes late and expect everybody to get out of the way because they got to get there you know

Recording: (8975/ 9621) 
there is no need to attack students over it and i read some article in the lantern i do not know why i read that but um i hate that paper but anyway um i read some article that the guy said he is not trying to attack students he just wants them to get annoyed so they will go whine to their parents about how the university does it and then they can all fight the establishment and 

Recording: (8976/ 9621) 
but like if you said i we will have a bus service we will go and pick you guys up you know and then then you can not use the excuse my car broke down or something and then like if you even you give them a like does not even have to be a hot meal i would think for breakfast or anything you know if you are on three shifts you can just you know here is the box of donuts and some milk or something you know that does not cost the company that much

Recording: (8982/ 9621) 
you know what i mean it do not matter to me whether you are black or white it matters to me whether way you treat me like when i first got out service is when they really started affirmative action i was going to get a job in the trucking industry and they could not hire me because of that was when they first come down with a mandate that they could only hire blacks

yeah 

Recording: (9028/ 9621) 
then you could go visit what the empire is that the big thing like the statue of liberty 

Recording: (9029/ 9621) 
it is yeah because pediatricians are able to dispense it and um i just you know felt like trying to avoid it as much as possible you know growing up 

Recording: (9030/ 9621) 
but when you look at coleman he thinks there was point where they they asked a yes or no question 

Recording: (9031/ 9621) 
no uh this is sherry 

Recording: (9032/ 9621) 
i am i am impressed i am like ok i tried to build a car and it did not look LIKE ANYTHING <LAUGH> 

Recording: (9033/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (9034/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9035/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9036/ 9621) 
yeah I THINK so i think so and like they just neither of the candidates really seem like they have that much integrity me you know so 

Recording: (9037/ 9621) 
it is probably family by family i mean that we <LAUGH> that is why i was a little bit late leaving work the way it was there we have got two coworkers one um has her child at the same day care as as myself she is about a year now and and listening to her and i mean she is there you know sixty seventy hours a week i mean she dropped off at six a m and not picked up till six thirty p m and she is fine with that me personally there is no way because somebody is totally in my opinion raising that child you are not getting to put your values your traditions what is important to you onto that child now the other girl she just has a four month old and has been in day care now for three weeks and she is gonna go she is she is gonna quit her job and go to um um night working nights three days a week because it is important to her to be at home with him 

Recording: (9038/ 9621) 
so she so i probably did learn a little bit because i i she still she is lives with a man now and he does all the cooking still so i have i have learned everything on my own upon cooking and stuff like that which i love to cook 

Recording: (9039/ 9621) 
i think society is today of today is less tolerant of uh a lot of things that they see where getting by with stuff you know and they are more vocal about it as opposed to being violent about it back in the sixties and stuff you know uh not here but you know down south there were people still getting hung and stuff you know for being a black or something and uh know there are bad blacks and there is bad whites too you know so but not all of them are you know are that way 

Recording: (9040/ 9621) 
um plus if they shoot somebody accidentally number one it is really hard to and secondly it probably will not kill them like a gun can um and you have to use your brain so i did not come from a hunting background um but my husband does work for the state highway patrol so obviously we know a lot of people that have to carry guns but none of them hardly any of them hunt um and a lot of them they respect them if you know what i mean they realize they can kill people we do get some of the you know machismo people that just wanna go out and shoot things and yeah yeah i yeah i do not it is not the guns that is the problem it is the people that are teaching 

Recording: (9041/ 9621) 
um so i am sure that PROBABLY increases the rate in public schools from 

Recording: (9042/ 9621) 
um i do more summer sports but um he is just beginning on the computer um i am pretty computer illiterate i have really never had a job yet it is always been working with food or plants 

Recording: (9043/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9044/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9045/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (9046/ 9621) 
and you register them and then you just keep after them you keep giving them information and then you just run a good get out the vote campaign uh in ohio i think it is easier to do that because there is a law that i do not think it is in primaries but in general elections at eleven oclock in the morning and four oclock in the afternoon they hafta list those who have voted they hafta put up a list of uh registered voters and cross out those who have voted so what i useta do is i took my list that i had gotten from the board of elections earlier and compared it with my list of who had shown support or was undecided on the election and i would cross off those that had voted and then i had a list of those that had not and i had people waiting at a phone bank and i would call them at work or at home and and i would offer to take them to the polls if you do not have a ride uh we will take you to the polls if you are worried about you know someone watching your kids we have certified teachers who will sit in the car with your kid or will sit in your home and will babysit for you while you go to vote because i have also read studies that say people who are routed from their home or their office you know and are reminded to go vote will also vote for whatever issue or candidate has reminded them to do that because what i did was is a very low key thing i would call people on election day and say hi this is roberta i am calling to remind you that today is election day and we hope that you will remember to exercise your most important freedom which is to go vote and oh by the way oh when you go to vote we hope that you will vote for such and such a school levy and and if you need a ride let me know we have got them set up for you and but you know that is very i mean and and that is not getting people to vote and encourage them to vote because they should that is a a special campaign for a particular issue or a candidate i do not know how you get people to vote i do not know why they do not think it is important maybe because we have had it too easy my my grandfather did not my grandfather did not i mean there was a king and queen and you know he had no right to vote so that when he came here and he could that was the most important thing in the world to him you know and that that he just passed it on to you know his daughter my mother my father i do not know how he it was important to him but it was always important to him and we talked about politics at the dinner table sometimes we talked about issues and he said you know it was important to to be heard so i do not know if it was that it got passed on parent wise or what it was 

Recording: (9047/ 9621) 
um about fifteen MINUTES my mom and i do not go to far FROM EACH OTHER SO but jason is gonna take the week off and everything so i think that we will we will be able to do that 

Recording: (9048/ 9621) 
and that is not right so i have always gotten two percent raises even though uh basically i been crosstrained or however you wanna say it i can work in three or four areas where most people can not but i have seen people get ten percent raises and i have seen me get two percent raise when i am doing three jobs and they are doing one 

Recording: (9049/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> i know how to get to it like the way we walk but i do not know what street its on 

Recording: (9050/ 9621) 
yeah i think mostly they did uh i was kind of surprised uh which class was this in i think this was in that introduction to the arts class i was kind of surprised that one of the students in class thought it was very hard <LAUGH> i did not think it was that hard at all but she wrote me some kind of nasty note at the last class or before the last class that she had a straight a average at this school before that my class and i was giving her a b and she was her average was going to be ruined and she hoped i felt guilty about it <LAUGH> not really <LAUGH> not really i mean i was grading on a pretty much of a curve too i mean i was trying really not to flunk anybody that was that was attempting to do the work uh i think i flunked one person that was really goofing off and uh but in terms of a curve i had as i had bs i had a few cs <LAUGH> yeah so yep oh well <LAUGH> 

Recording: (9051/ 9621) 
well when you get into the black population you sometimes see some 

Recording: (9052/ 9621) 
whether they are play a video game where they are shooting people i can not say they see that as being something that affects them 

Recording: (9053/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (9054/ 9621) 
huh 

Recording: (9055/ 9621)

Recording: (9058/ 9621) 
little girl i always think you should name a kid i have opinions about everything see i think you should name a kid something that will fit him at eighty three and eight and in between like we named our son robert so when he was little he was robbie now he is eighteen he is rob when he becomes an attorney or whatever he wants to do he can be robert paul you know and in kindergarten all he had to learn to write was r o b or r o b b y so that it you know i have a hard time picturing an eighty three year old woman as a tammy 

Recording: (9059/ 9621) 
it is actually not that difficult but 

Recording: (9060/ 9621) 
i am the only little one on my whole block 

Recording: (9061/ 9621) 
yeah but it is not a good way for me to make money because if you are farming out people or if you are better still drop it down a level if you are exchanging hours for money or time for money then you have a finite amount of time and that sucks 

Recording: (9062/ 9621) 
uh well i think only because i went abroad i had basically one extra quarter beyond four years

Recording: (9068/ 9621) 
so ah you know i i just think the more you are open about things i just think that is the best why it you know when you put things and do not talk about it that is when the problems start 

Recording: (9069/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9070/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9071/ 9621)

Recording: (9174/ 9621) 
not really but i think living in the bible belt as she did she was living there ten years before she married and uh got involved in a youth group and i think that that was very influential on her decision and so she was married in the church all my other children were but you know she is she is going her own path and that is fine with me she is very good girl and she is very conscientious and 

Recording: (9175/ 9621) 
we would like teach english to little kids or or help clean or work at libraries or different things 

Recording: (9176/ 9621) 
it it is 

Recording: (9177/ 9621) 
they they would go out there and there was um i suppose it was a county seat town and they would file a claim on a certain area of land uh it was surveyed off and marked off in sections a section of land is uh six hundred and forty acres and that sounds like a lot of it is a good sized area 

Recording: (9178/ 9621) 
have you really have you gone to seen all the shows and 

Recording: (9179/ 9621) 
and then we would go do what we wanted to do 

Recording: (9180/ 9621) 
and you know i just really think they need to make that and not uh an option for a young girl i really do because there is just you know there is just too many unwanted children there just is and that really bothers me that we do not have another option like another country um we are a lot more right wing here in america but i just feel that is got to be an option you know for these young girls it just really does 

Recording: (9181/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9182/ 9621) 
or whatever femalee female so that was her name femalee she thought boy they are nice in this country they even named my baby for me people are so stupid 

Recording: (9183/ 9621) 
we got divorced in eighty eight 

Recording: (9184/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (9185/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9186/ 9621) 
and they leave then you get either another asshole or somebody good you just wait until you get somebody good 

Recording: (9187/ 9621) 
then the people that are doing you think why do you why are we hiring these guys you know what are they what are they THINKING 

Recording: (9188/ 9621) 
i blame it on that yeah because you know there is been a lot more kids that have died in school then you know just recently i guess it was not in the biggin numbers at one time but there is been random violence in schools you know where kids would die even more than you know seven or whatever and i think that the media is just made it into something that they have glamorized it and some of the kids i think are screwed up anyway and they are just like well hey you know i can do that and i will be on the yeah i do i think that is a big part of that because they want their name known and they do not care if they die anyway um-hum um-hum 

Recording: (9189/ 9621) 
actually they are they are working on it i am sorry i did not mean to interrupt you uh um they have they have um just instated some bonus schemes where as the poverty level i think is considered um thirteen thousand pounds a year um and if if you are below the poverty level and you do go back to work you get a certain like extra bonus beyond yeah so there is a bonus for back to work you mentioned earlier about like how this would effect the children with this two year welfare thing i mean at least i know a lot more about the system there for FOR WHATEVER reason than i do about the system here which is kind of unfortunate but um there i mean i do not really think and a lot of situations of course i i am sure there are people who follow it as it should be and who who really need it and who really you know taking care of their children but unfortunately you do not really see that side very much you see the people who like their kids see none of that money you know they are left at home by themselves if if they can even you know get them to school if they even go to school if they are even bothered you know and you know those you know a lot of there is there documentaries on all the time there so you really it is sort of it is more in your face than it is here at that i ever noticed um but i do think and and with that they have specific programs for the children and um i think one of the problems too with the schools is the fact that you know if a if a kid has bad behavior or you know bad attendance that you send them home i mean i think that is the most ridiculous thing like surely that is not a punishment for a lot of these kids and you know at least in england on these things i have seen you know they send them home and these kids are just doing whatever going around the neighborhood shoplifting bullying you know hotwiring cars at the age of you know ten or something and i do not know i think i do have SORT OF VERY STRONG OPINIONS about people yeah who are having all these kids and do not take care of them at all 

Recording: (9190/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9191/ 9621)

and when i started as an apprentice in the shop they said well we will start you at a dollar an hour well i thought that sounds pretty good you know in nineteen forty five in the fall of nineteen forty five so then as things worked out in washington d c they came out with the g i bill of rights we found out that uh that would apply to apprentices too

Recording: (9206/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9207/ 9621) 
as a result of the one trying to force myself back into what to do so i mean it is yeah i mean when i when you come down to these things there is uh people with mental illness and with a disability are trying to pawn off their responsibility onto everybody but themselves you know well the medical doctors if they would of seen this guy and given him medication he would not of went out there and killed somebody you know shoulda would have could have man if the guy stopped taking his medication of his own free will that was his responsibility to take that medicine every day just like it is mine take mine every day and when i stop taking mine that was my responsibility which is why i do not wanna go to the legal system to try and make an excuse even though there is a there is a some law that protects people that if they were drunk or on the influence of medication or or off the influence of medication um in case they bought a house or signed into some kind of contract that they would not be liable

yeah it it might and you know good teachers do that i i i still get upset when i was teaching school i did activity based teaching um and i was doing some volunteer work at dublin schools it was supposed be one of the better schools in the area and i thought there would be all sorts of creative things going on and there was not it was still read the chapter write the answers to the questions at the end of the book and i thought how boring i mean there are different ways to get kids turned on to things um i am not sure there is so much influence from the media uh and i say media broad based so you would be it print media or tv um that has this culture today of um stars and you know media of of phenomenons and and they do not see the relevance and i do not think they hear from their parents like i did the importance of voting and that is where it comes from their parents do not vote so if their parents do not vote they are not uh again i do not know what the the answer is um but it is very scary what is gonna happen in the next couple of generations the only good thought for me is i think about this is that i will not be here to see the disintegration of the democracy although i have great faith too i have great faith in democracy um there are always good people that somehow come up and i think if there were an issue i think kids would if if there were kids in college that were being drafted and being sent to die in a war that people did not think was important or had no real relevance to their lives i mean i think the kids would would rally immediately and the issue right now is that there is nothing there

Recording: (9265/ 9621)

Recording: (9267/ 9621) 
right wow 

Recording: (9268/ 9621) 
i was too young 

Recording: (9269/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (9270/ 9621) 
or that are having kids and i mean we talk about that is all we do is sit in there and talk about our kids and what they are doing and how our parents and them reacted like there was this girl that just got in there today and and her parents WERE LIKE flipping out because she is pregnant and um we were telling we were all telling her about how you know um it it always starts out that way and they will ease up later on 

Recording: (9271/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (9272/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (9273/ 9621) 
i know 

Recording: (9274/ 9621) 
at that time in the uh thirties 

Recording: (9275/ 9621) 
do you want this donor to be this this and that some people will some people some people say that i feel sorry for those people i pray for those people because prayers the most powerful thing you can have it is gonna get you through nothing else i do not care what challenge you have in front of you you put in his hands and you have enough faith to practice it he will come through it may not come through the way you think it is you want it to but somewhere along the line you are gonna say uh for some reason i was not i am supposed to do this i can not explain it but you are always looking for reasons you are asking me i am looking for reasons but a lot of times you can not give a reason it just happens why did you marry your husband why did you how did you meet your husband how did you come about how passing on to explain that to your offspring someday 

Recording: (9276/ 9621) 
to help him 

Recording: (9277/ 9621) 
those are as i you were implying those are needs two those people but they are not uh so how do we correct some of this you have got to i think we have got to cut out a lot of this luxury we have got to slowly bring quote that family back home uh and i do not necessarily say it has to be the woman versus the man who cares in today is work uh world far less agriculturally related uh we are far more in service orientation and manufacturing orientation uh so uh a man and uh uh a or a me a woman can do most of the work that is being done outside of the home today versus what they could have done as agricultural people uh and so once again though that would bring people back to this central family make up this has to be communications communications as it is going uh that it is irreversible uh i think it can be redirected in much in the manner she is speaking uh and uh and where does this start i think it has start back here in first grade i think parents must participate with teachers uh as we used to uh was just common uh you could walk in and sit down and uh watch the students or participate with participate and or assist uh well today they have these assistants but they are hired directed assistants they are not in there portraying or passing their own their values of the community to the students uh so i think that is i i guess i i will continue to come back to family to family almost everything has got to come back to family bring that family back together and get them to communicate on that personal basis not that impersonal basis 

Recording: (9278/ 9621) 
because they are saying you are still a kid but yet 

Recording: (9279/ 9621)

Recording: (9297/ 9621) 
so hard i mean every summer they have homework that has to be done or else the first grading period is an f and when uh my yeah oldest daughter went to northland first because she thought about being a teacher and they had a teaching academy there and once she got into it she went uh maybe not <LAUGH> so i said well what you know whatever so then she wanted to go to because it is basically a columbus public school that is geared to college only i mean if if you are not going to college do not go there because you will flunk out it is very hard and she got in the second year three weeks before school started and so we go over there and they hand her this stack of material that is got to be done in three weeks so i thought well i will just call and i called and i talked to the principal and i said you know they gave us all this stuff and you know everybody else has had june july august to get this done and she is got three weeks and she goes and the principal goes that is correct and i go well there is no way she can get this done and i said you know everybody else has had all this time and she is gonna get it done in three weeks and they go that is right so they take there is no excuses you know and it is it is very hard i know my youngest daughter who is just as smart as my oldest would do horrible there because you know basically they say uh we are talking about china this week and uh on december the fifteenth we want a report on why chinese people do what they do you know and it is like and every week they do not come by and go have you started have you started have you started do you have the outline right and it is up to you to go gosh i have to have an outline i have to bibliography i have to have the facts i have to interview some people and if you do not sit down with a little calendar and go this week i am getting this done this week i am getting this done and this you just fail so my oldest daughter is pretty uh detail oriented so after we kind of helped her start you know and say you know you are you are gonna hafta do these things so you get this done and i said and basically get it done like two weeks before it is done so then you can say oh this is not very good and you know amend it or whatever or or help somebody you know get somebody with typing whatever so she is really good and it is it is helped her at school a lot because i know they uh she she toured here at ohio state and there were some people here that come from cahs and they go this will be easier than your highschool <LAUGH> so 

Recording: (9298/ 9621)

Recording: (9300/ 9621)

she there is are wanderlust right there she travels all the time 

Recording: (9304/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (9305/ 9621) 
how to do it so i think that would probably be about the biggest differences just really the amount of education you get 

Recording: (9306/ 9621) 
you can not especially with kids it is just too overwhelming 

Recording: (9307/ 9621) 
really why just because it is close to japan 

Recording: (9308/ 9621) 
i was more comfortable here than in high school you do not see like the big cliques like the popular abercrombie wearing people or like all the art students hanging out together it is a big mix of people and everyone is doing their own thing 

Recording: (9309/ 9621) 
well i am very much in favor of gun control very strong gun control um i it they just seem to be too available uh but then some of the things that the schools are doing about it know the kid who comes to school with a paper gun gets suspended that is a little much but 

Recording: (9310/ 9621) 
i think that is great you know i think obviously there is always a down side and but i think that too many people abuse the system and you know unfortunately it is very hard when you know then it ruins it for the people who really do need it and but you know as long as they have you know created a system whereby you know it will not be obviously as good for those people as it has been the ones who are genuinely unemployable but you know i think depending on how um sort of focused they are on the individuals in their area or whatever however it is divided up i do not know hopefully not special treatment but obviously you would try to steer them more in whichever direction they are most suited for you know as far as maybe like the volunteer work because i mean you know there is so much volunteering to be done everywhere and even if you do not have you know if you are lacking in whatever way you would think that you can you know there is something you know hopefully that i do not know 

Recording: (9311/ 9621) 
um-hum

Recording: (9317/ 9621) 
but i do not understand is this can with the construction they start everywhere you know you think that you would start one area you put a whole bunch of people and they would work real fast and they would get that done and then they would move on but it is like every single PLACE IN THE city is got like four guys working and you think what the hell you doing over there 

Recording: (9318/ 9621)

Recording: (9339/ 9621) 
i have not either i never knew that they had so many beaches i mean i know that had a good reputation you know for for like just just just you know just having a great vacation time because nobody ever came back was ready to tell oh yeah this place was terrible you know the weather was bad you know that people were people were rude everybody there they would say so ah you gotta go you gotta go yes it you know it is a long flight but it is well worth the time 

Recording: (9340/ 9621) 
where 

Recording: (9341/ 9621) 
cumulonimbus or whatever you know and uh you know he was pretty much pissed off the rest the way up there because uh i was right 

Recording: (9342/ 9621) 
my answer to your question is has this eroded i am gonna answer with the word using the word respect uh yes i feel that uh this has eroded over time uh there is not the respect for our elders i do not necessarily mean elders in terms of the uh chronological age but i am talking in terms of generations the uh there is less respect for the father less respect for the mother less respect for the grandparents and the great grandparents uh i am gonna give you a first hand example i just had a uh conversation with one of my granddaughters who is now twenty uh she will come over to my house grandpa is house and she will come in and she will flop down in a chair uh and she will do nothing in that household even if you suggest it uh i do not ever tell her uh do to do things and i have pointed out to her that whenever we went to visit grandpa or great grandfather uh if the if we saw weeds out in the garden we went out and we hoed the garden if we if or the chicken house need to be cleaned uh and they had not gotten to it that day we went out and cleaned the chicken house we would say grandpa is it okay if we go out and clean your chicken house well course you knew very well it was gonna be okay but a matter of respect though you ask is it okay for us to do it and uh now with her uh i can have dishes out there in the sink uh that are left there for from breakfast maybe lunch and uh she she will walk out there and will say well grandpa how come your dishes are not done and then she turns around walks away that is right you uh-huh and and she may then go ahead and say well now sometimes she will ask and sometimes she does not but lets assume she did she will ask is it alright if i have some of this she goes ahead and gets the dishes out so forth she puts them right in there in that sink uh with those other dishes makes no efforts to clean them and and i i i have seen this in many many many incidents but i am giving you this is very first hand i know this and i strongly suspect that this is a typical typical thing in our society today so yes in my opinion definitely it is eroding i know you took a little different approach in answering the question uh from over the time that that this kind of thing is eroding based upon the word respect <LAUGH> <LAUGH> she just used the word penalty uh penalty has of different definitions each individual has a mental picture what the word penalty means based upon their own experiences all i wanna take just and it say it penalty in a very general sort of way whatever your extreme is to the right or to the left lets come back to about the middle i am concerned that we are getting away from penalties completely and i feel it is absolutely essential that we have penalties we have for everyone for everyone really across the board uh we we are getting away from penalty we are getting away from penalty uh uh so many people i just to give an example talking about adults i just read uh statistics the other day right here columbus where uh it was an extremely high percent i can not quote the percentages of people who uh ignore uh yellow lights and and of consequence they are ending up going through red lights and there many many many accidents taking place uh i and we it used to be that you could place uh uh an a law enforcement officer the corner if it happened and he immediately he would uh penalize you by giving your ticket and you face the court as the case may be well now we have passed so many little ordinances and laws and change the enforcement policies and this kinds of things well the poor police officer he can not even do that any longer he is got if somebody uh runs through red light you almost have to hit somebody and then be accused for going through the red light he can not just arbitrarily be there because that is called oh i think the word harassment plays a part you are harassing that individual because you were standing there waiting for him to commit this problem when i let us just get away from that example you can talk about whether you did you were carrying uh i do not want to get in to the guns and knives and stuff in the school that is enough for 

Recording: (9343/ 9621) 
you know i think a lot of times uh you you know people are not real rational as far as as who they they go for 

Recording: (9344/ 9621) 
it was okay to put up with my trying to learn how to be a parent in exchange for having me all to herself 

Recording: (9345/ 9621) 
not at all 

Recording: (9346/ 9621) 
check their i d is i mean the guys are trying to look older the girls are trying to look 

Recording: (9347/ 9621) 
i think because of the movies and i think of nintendo and all those games that they have on there i think that really does spark things in little children is minds and even you know like in junior high that oh yeah we could do that you know and there is just so much violence in when we were growing up there was not any violence on tv we were not allowed to watch it but you know i mean i mean the comics were not violent um now it is too open for kids the parents you know they say the parents should monitor them 

Recording: (9348/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (9349/ 9621) 
and um from downstairs we broke into my computer 

Recording: (9350/ 9621) 
they just i am not sure really what they do 

Recording: (9351/ 9621) 
i do not know 

Recording: (9352/ 9621) 
yeah my kids were both two two weeks late so i know how it is <LAUGH> <LAUGH> 

Recording: (9353/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (9354/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9355/ 9621) 
it is kind of an neat place is not it 

Recording: (9356/ 9621) 
i guess so i hope that they can keep the school somehow for the kids and but it will not be him running it <LAUGH> 

Recording: (9357/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9358/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah 

Recording: (9359/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9360/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9361/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9362/ 9621) 
somebody must have been watching over me 

Recording: (9363/ 9621) 
anybody see that 

Recording: (9364/ 9621) 
exactly 

Recording: (9365/ 9621) 
there is a lot of uh i do not know how how the training is done with some of these animals you know some of them are treated very cruelly 

Recording: (9366/ 9621) 
i have not seen any fights i have not seen anyone get shot i mean you read about it in the lantern but the only thing that i was really shocked about was the people begging on high street 

Recording: (9367/ 9621) 
no uh was just the usual thing since she touched my things <LAUGH> ya know because they were far apart enough they had their own social groups they had their own friends and so ya know so that and interests so it there was not much of that but there was the usual ya know she is breathing on me in the car he is humming too loud <LAUGH> i do not know if you have got brothers and sisters but yeah you have probably been you have went through it all yeah well there were five of us and <LAUGH> a lot of that 

Recording: (9368/ 9621) 
but you know what i mean when he was about nine years old but he is known me all my life so you know what i mean it was not no big shock 

Recording: (9369/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (9370/ 9621) 
that they fired him like that the night before the michigan game so then the next day he came out on the field with a black suit and a fedora you know a hat he looked so cool you know because joe paterno he always wears a tie i do not know he just he he is a great coach 

Recording: (9371/ 9621) 
yeah um and this is something i have thought about a lot because if i had stayed in cincinnati say where it is very conservative you know not real open to new things or if i had stayed on the east coast where of course it would be really competitive i i probably would not be working as a freelancer today i came to columbus there was not you know there was not much going on when i came here 

Recording: (9372/ 9621) 
oh really 

Recording: (9373/ 9621) 
yeah it it is she does not even drive to work you know 

Recording: (9374/ 9621) 
and we were stopped at one of their defensive lines 

Recording: (9375/ 9621) 
but then you will have to have people running the machinery and checking the machinery 

Recording: (9376/ 9621) 
you know we will go places you know 

Recording: (9377/ 9621) 
i am not that old yet I MIGHT LOOK IT 

Recording: (9378/ 9621) 
they do not have rabies 

Recording: (9379/ 9621) 
yeah yeah yeah i it surprises me to to find that that columbus is is so out of shape um but i am in the i well you know in the circles that i move in um everybody is very middle aged and they all quit SMOKING AND THEYRE ALL ALL OF the sudden trying to beat off the reaper and um uh so you know i mean i mean well and course they were always hippies and ate sprouts and twigs and leaves anyway you know so you know that is the sort of circles i move in but i know because i have these part time jobs from time to time i see a a whole different group of people and i can say it is probably true <LAUGH> 

Recording: (9380/ 9621) 
uhuh 

Recording: (9381/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9382/ 9621) 
just 

Recording: (9383/ 9621) 
so once you convince people that there is nothing be scared of here and there is nothing to be scared of there i mean and then they start to play and once you start playing you start learning 

Recording: (9384/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9385/ 9621) 
in in much in much other things you know that i am coming to understand 

Recording: (9386/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9387/ 9621) 
we did not know you know anything about what he did or we found out more um after he died 

Recording: (9388/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9389/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9390/ 9621) 
yeah i yeah that is another thing i hear about I DONT KNOW 

Recording: (9391/ 9621) 
you know they never ask for extra money and uh they had to cut back on everything and i think it just set people back now we are trying real hard to catch up and at some point we are going to um you know have to put a levy on again and and uh who knows what is happen we are keeping rosa smith right now because she is so good p r with the with the business community but the business community in columbus does not really support the schools they do not i mean we have got two new uh stadiums and we have not got any increase in school funding 

Recording: (9392/ 9621) 
yep uh my oldest she is the oldest um she is got three kids one her oldest is by a different guy and her new husband adopted her because they she never sees him um and then they got two other girls and they live together got a house you know they are on they are going through marriage they have been together for like five years and they are not going they are not doing very WELL right now but hopefully you know they will get over that and then i got an older brother who um him and his girlfriend moved in together and they just had a baby 

Recording: (9393/ 9621) 
so they i have o s u insurance but i had no doctor at the time and they would not admit me they told me they were going to make wait two months before they did anything and what i did i had my wife drive me down to the hospital i crawled out of the car crawled into the hospital and told them either admit me or i would crawl out the door 

Recording: (9394/ 9621) 
yeah and it is been five years this year that we have been married and uh close to seven that i have known him so and it is still just as exciting it is still just as good and yeah he amazes me everyday because i am i am one to all this will not last forever but you know <LAUGH> and he is like well when we are ninety <LAUGH> you know you will know <LAUGH> so 

Recording: (9395/ 9621) 
so uh he finally decided uh you know after oh well when he was in catholic school they kept his kept his desk in the hallway you know 

Recording: (9396/ 9621) 
why i mean it is part of the scripture that you say you believe in a hundred percent then why do not you why do not you talk about it and the problem is that they do not they do not know the answer and if they do not know the answer if they can not give a firm this is the answer then they avoid it <excli> try and find it i try and find for me what has become the best answer you know if i do not if i do not if i do not believe something or i do not know what to believe about something i will go and i will find an answer for myself i am not gonna take somebody else is answer and if i do take someone else is answer they better be able to back it up you know yeah yeah yeah yeah well i know a lot of people that do but i know a lot of people that do not um-hum um-hum um do the theological discussions no no unless unless you are seeking that out i mean i go to the vineyard church it is up in it is up in uh um westerville and there is about there is about probably six thousand of us it is one the biggest churches in ohio and um but if you want to find something in that church you can find it you can find a discussion group about anything it is just a matter of finding it and within any within any denomination or within any religion you go as deep as you want to go you know there are people that would just go on sunday mornings there are people who just go on easter there are people who go monday wednesday tuesday and then sunday nights and saturday nights and are very very very into that and i mean i am not the monday tuesday wednesday thursday type but i am pretty involved i am pretty involved um-hum the community the community um the church is designed as a community of other christians it is not necessarily designed as um i heard this in a sermon this is really good um it is not designed as the congregation comes in and says way to go pastor you go do it we are gonna cheer you on the job of a christian is to go out and spread the gospel of jesus christ that is the job of a christian and there are a lot of churches who have totally forgotten that that is what the original you know that is what the that is what a christian is supposed to do and that is what our church does 

Recording: (9397/ 9621) 
oh wow 

Recording: (9398/ 9621) 
and that is actually a really interesting thing too because especially coming back you know and moving all my stuff out of storage i have just been on this you know i am getting rid of half of everything i own because over there it is you know it just feels so weird to come back and i feel so loaded down especially when i have spent so much time just living out of a suitcase you know i just really realize i have so much stuff that i do not need because there you know everyone has just sort of like a little closet with clothes you know there is not stuff all around everything is more expensive so everyone has a lot less and here it is like everything is so relatively inexpensive that it is like you know picture frames or something there might be you know twenty five dollars for one so you buy one here oh you know they are five dollars a piece lets buy five you know 

Recording: (9399/ 9621) 
and that is what i am saying atoning for sins it is quite a hypocrisy when you got a church telling you that you need to ask for forgiveness when what they did i mean in the church in zanesville where i went and buried my grandparents and went to all my life over the door of the church was a picture of christopher columbus with a missionary a priest and all his men with his sword drawn a dead native american at his feet and three more at the side looking on in fear now i asked the priest cold hard question 

Recording: (9400/ 9621) 
i get wick that is it <LAUGH> 

Recording: (9401/ 9621) 
so uh i had some family responsibilities we were my brother and i and my sisters were active in the four h clubs

Recording: (9406/ 9621) 
and he did that too uh 

Recording: (9407/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9408/ 9621) 
simply because it is not too much of a change from the status quo 

Recording: (9409/ 9621) 
um and like even the people the maybe their apartments did not look as impressive but they were making money 

Recording: (9410/ 9621)

Recording: (9412/ 9621) 
the 

Recording: (9413/ 9621) 
yeah and unknown and i think it could work uh but i do not think people were ready to accept it and if the people giving the information are not ready to accept it then 

Recording: (9414/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (9415/ 9621) 
um-hum hum 

Recording: (9416/ 9621) 
uh you are in a high tech society and most people you said you are from new york right your family is where 

Recording: (9417/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (9418/ 9621)

Recording: (9420/ 9621) 
well they only keep them there like for you know a day or so and then they um try to intervene with their family put them back with their family or um maybe call in children is sevices and i and i just really do not think much of children is services so 

Recording: (9421/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> yeah i do not know where they are going now but 

Recording: (9422/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (9423/ 9621) 
see you tomorrow i mean hold them feel the warmth of the body uh hear the conversation quietly rather than uh hearing okay time to get out of here you know with a vigorous saying but with pleasant sort of remark these kind i can i could write a whole book on that on this on answer your uh but it is these kinds of things are very elementary really they are very elementary i guess to our age group but maybe not so sure uh maybe the baby boomers that would not be elementary at all uh going back to your question about the baby boomers i still think they were i do not think they are causing them but then i think it was a happenstance uh with that group with a massive group variant 

Recording: (9424/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (9425/ 9621) 
oh i think that is good 

Recording: (9426/ 9621) 
i can see that i you know uh like i said for me i kind of a i kinda stay where i am so it is not that i really travel out into some of those other areas more so i mean it does not really affect me personally maybe that is bad I DONT KNOW MAYBE SHOULD I feel guilty ABOUT THAT but 

Recording: (9427/ 9621) 
that is all they understand is money 

Recording: (9428/ 9621) 
my thesis is on the sudeten germans those are the germans who lived in czechoslovakia uh before the second world war and uh specifically i am looking at how they perceived their condition switching from being part of the austrohungarian empire uh and the germans being sort of the uh the majority uh even though they were not the majority but sort of the the uh the the master nation within the austrohungarian empire to becoming uh a minority within czechoslovakia 

Recording: (9429/ 9621)

Recording: (9437/ 9621) 
my mom teaches there so it is free tuition i get a tuition waiver 

Recording: (9438/ 9621) 
you know that is possibility you do not you you are not supposed to carry that much money around and it is as much to protect the people after you as it isto protect you because you know the the word has to get out that we do not have that much money <LAUGH> it DOESNT pay <LAUGH> yeah 

Recording: (9439/ 9621) 
you know always something going on 

Recording: (9440/ 9621) 
personally i think it is too late because they can get things on the internet you know there is just so many things so many avenues for them to find violence and pornography and you know things things that we you know when i was growing up we just there was no way i could see any of that stuff i had good parents but i i was in to you know lassie and tom and jerry i mean you know these but you know they were not violent and they made you feel good after you watched them but i i just think i do not think it could turn back right now i do not know 

Recording: (9441/ 9621) 
no the lifestyle was you know very easy to fit into and i have always been you know interested it and you know sort of like to the whole like european culture um before i went there but i think the most difficult was actually because i was studying english when i went there and you know studying english here is a dime a dozen and studying english in or in england is you know sort of i do not know uh more uh sort of elitist which i did not realize before i got there so i was in all these courses i was the only american and the classes were really small and it was you know you i definitely got a feeling and a it there were a few classes that really stood out where you know there was sort of you know you would i would hafta say something or i would hafta give a presentation or something and it was sort of like oh you know what what does this american know and you know it was that was the hardest thing is the way i was treated by some of my um peers in classes i mean not directly they would never say anything terrible to you or anything but it was just sort of you know that feeling of uh 

Recording: (9442/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (9443/ 9621) 
so they get more buying power if they go there okay 

Recording: (9444/ 9621)

he does and his love he he his music is extremely good he taught himself so he by ya know sixteen he is playing eight instruments very well uh he just and he can not do that now where he lives now he lives with uh this another thing that boggles my mind his uh girlfriend is mother she he is afraid her his girlfriend that her daughter was gonna run away so she let us them sleep together in their house when she her daughter was fourteen 

Recording: (9450/ 9621) 
when he was one just for one minute my mother taught me that um i do not i do not stand him in the corner 

Recording: (9451/ 9621) 
it is huge 

Recording: (9452/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (9453/ 9621) 
would i want them to do that to me and i think if you could teach your kids that and get back to teaching them things thing on those radio programs and tv programs instead of what they are showing right now i think the world would be a place a lot better place and along with the politicians they stop saying now what is really best for the general public instead of well we think to make ourselves look great 

Recording: (9454/ 9621) 
there is lots of of uh theater and the third thing would be we got restaurants <LAUGH> 

Recording: (9455/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9456/ 9621) 
well i can tell you some community bands that could use you <LAUGH> yeah yeah 

Recording: (9457/ 9621) 
i am retired 

Recording: (9458/ 9621) 
yeah i mean it is like it is known but it is in a different way it is like a different type of fame than like traditional style so it is like more of like a respect as opposed to like an admiration type thing like like it is more of like a it is not like an m t v type thing you know 

Recording: (9459/ 9621) 
and he was the assistant manager of a video game store i worked at in high school 

Recording: (9460/ 9621) 
she is she is wonderful but back then they were there was the sixties and they were hippies and you know my moms got long jet black hair and they are wearing their army outfits and they are whatever you know everybody is got bellbottoms and my dads got long hair down to here and everything so they lived like seventeenth avenue for a while and we lived um like i said on summit until i was about three years old and then they split up for a little bit and got back together and my mom and i lived some place on campus in just a little one room apartment it was just she and i and i would go see my dad on the weekends which was which was which great for me i mean my dad and i would do fun stuff my mom and i would do fun stuff and it and and i i never remember it being negative 

Recording: (9461/ 9621) 
um and i definitely i mean i have think i went to like kindergarten in the public school so i do not really know too much about like the kind of curriculums and things that they had to do but i know i mean as far as going to a lot of the stuff like in math and things like that that i am doing now is stuff i already covered in high school so i already have a basis for it 

Recording: (9462/ 9621) 
yeah that is what it seems i mean i know it is like i mean it is the same proportions i mean there are more old people there but just seems more apparent just because of how but you can like go outside all the time you know i mean there is never like three or four months where you just wanna sit in your house and 

Recording: (9463/ 9621) 
you know it is like look you always think i could you know look i am doing really well look how wonderful everything is 

Recording: (9464/ 9621) 
i think the news media have hyped it up too much really i mean we have an accord with cuba that says anyone that is trying to escape from cuba to united states that is found at sea is immediately returned to cuba whether you agree with it or not that is the accord and that is what that is what castro is that is the premise he is operating on uh you know and the news media they have not really been a they just they have not been real objective about it i mean uh you know like there two fisherman that found him at sea you never hear about the other one because that this was on one just briefly i heard on the news because he thinks he should go back to his father but you do not hear about him there is three cousins two of them think he should stay miami the other one thinks he should go back with his father you do not hear about him i was reading about him news week or someplace uh so i think the news media is not been totally objective about this 

Recording: (9465/ 9621) 
um you know it is stuff like that it is like it is kind of neat because you do not have to pay well you have to pay for it but like magazines 

Recording: (9466/ 9621) 
but we still need to have property manager records that is very essential and a lot times when you are talking to engineers they do not realize that part of it um they do not like the detail at least that aspect of it uh but we need to have a lot of that because you need know how uh your uh facilities are structured uh the time history any type of uh activity on that whether it is been uh installed removed relocated whatever might be but we need know that how it had an impact upon the design of a the particular uh facility voice and data 

Recording: (9467/ 9621) 
yeah i mean like it just it provides an a a window of opportunity for those who really do work like 

Recording: (9468/ 9621) 
three years i have them usually i have them sixth seventh and eighth for those language arts subjects unless they get some miraculous cure and they get phased out like right now i am phasing a kid an eighth grader out and into the regular english but he worked really really hard and he is very bright and he is still a terrible speller but he is not lazy and he does his assignments and as long as you clearly explain to him what he is supposed to do and he is a good writer and usually when he misspells something you can figure out what it says from the context you know so we are in the process of phasing him out so that he will not have to he is had help i think since he was in kindergarten that is the other thing that is really an enigma about these kids ninety percent of the time their i q is like a hundred and fifteen to a hundred and thirty and i mean they are very bright but yet something is not 

Recording: (9469/ 9621) 
i know the way we you know the way we dressed and everything you know it was kind of appalling to to the parents and everything i guess maybe that is where i am coming from i mean uh the way some of the uh kids dress you know retro back to when with the bell bottoms and everything to us and the uh the piercings i just can not get into that you know and then some of the girls i mean they you know i mean my god they at fourteen six fifteen years old they look like they are twenty some years old you know and that is what they want to look like plus you watch some of these stupid shows on tv you know you sit there and go man i could not my daughter do not do that you know it is when she is around me never when she is away from me i do not know what the hell she does 

Recording: (9470/ 9621) 
he was only fifty six 

Recording: (9471/ 9621) 
hilliard

Recording: (9473/ 9621) 
there is uh you know i just uh is i had three spiritual leaders tell me that a great gift came with that that there was it was no accident it was supposed to happen and uh there is a word called synchronicity 

Recording: (9474/ 9621) 
well and and and especially in my situation you know at the i think about it quite a bit you know if i would have had a more of an opportunity to have a one on one uh relationship with her i would probably uh uh being a girl you know could of probably helped her out in the in a lot of social things social things you know about man because i i kind of get the impression that she do not really that she still ai not very interested in men you know so much as it is her thing you know so 

Recording: (9475/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (9476/ 9621) 
just you know it is let people make their own mistakes and then but do not make me pay for it yeah 

Recording: (9477/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> like like what is the you if you had time but if you had time and money and well you you would be able to you know do the do the tourists things 

Recording: (9478/ 9621) 
oh yeah i was never gonna get married again i had my house my kids you know i had already done that i was financially secure and i did not i was not even looking one of my best friends though at the time uh she saw this guy she he was the roommate of a guy she was seeing and i talked to this girl every day and she is like oh you have to meet him you have to meet him i was like oh you know call me tomorrow i do not WANT TO meet anybody so it took a long time for us to be introduced but then as soon as we were she was right i mean uh we were like inseparable from probably of two weeks after we met we just i have have not been without him so

Recording: (9481/ 9621) 
exactly right yeah yeah and you know a lot of people i work with do not see that and you know they think i am a real cheapskate you know because you know i i spend money you know it well i i am very selective i mean like uh i would love to go to disney world and there are people at work that will not go to disney world just because of what it costs to get in you know now i drive there i do not fly because i am really that cheap but you know i would love to fly but i just go oh my gosh and uh you know but you know i will do that but you know like um like at uh thanksgiving time we do not buy a butterball turkey we buy a meijer and it is like it is just as good you know and you know we make do you know

Recording: (9495/ 9621) 
that is fine 

Recording: (9496/ 9621) 
i do not get on it but i mean it is there 

Recording: (9497/ 9621)

Recording: (9507/ 9621) 
i tried volunteering you know at picking them up doing a volunteer thing and i would get calls all during the night to go pick these kids up because i thought i was doing something to help but you know you are not helping them 

Recording: (9508/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9509/ 9621) 
just uh why do not i just go back and copy cat something she said uh picking up that picking up that child and cuddling it um and having having that baby touch your skin and uh and uh uh teaching how what love is uh uh you do not necessarily teach love by words but it is just by the feel that child will begin to love you as the father or the mother or the brother little brother and the little sister all of those now you say teach that well my god did not they know that when they first came into this classroom no not today not today i i dare say that uh the vast majority and i mean above fifty well above fifty percent when i say that i am not being arbitrary um students in high school today probably have not had their mother or their father truly hold them and hug them rather than just saying hi johnny bye 

Recording: (9510/ 9621) 
in where 

Recording: (9511/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9512/ 9621) 
you are talking to people all over the country and i mean you are becoming more diversified because you get thoughts and opinions from people from all across the world and 

Recording: (9513/ 9621) 
the lawyers the judges everybody that works in that system i do not care who they are there is not an honest one in it i do not care there is not an honest one in it they might think they are but once you expose yourself to corruption <LAUGH> you take that in with you 

Recording: (9514/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (9515/ 9621) 
so i just with that terrible thing that happened in montana 

Recording: (9516/ 9621) 
yeah i will be starting in two thousand three 

Recording: (9517/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9518/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (9519/ 9621) 
i mean i i i mean that probably can be proven i do not know if anybody would do any decent studies on it i just bet you a million dollars that you know it would be the influence of tv you know the and then and another thing that is well tv is the uh where it comes from but like the kids are all into pokemon right now 

Recording: (9520/ 9621) 
i have yeah i have been here pretty much all my life until just recent weeks when i moved up to DELAWARE <LAUGH> it is it is a real comfort you know comfort for me because everybody pretty much around where we useta live just you know it gets worse and worse 

Recording: (9521/ 9621) 
yeah go in there and find out you know is the kid being abused if the kids being abused you know take him out you know forget the parents rights you know or um yeah you know if they are using drugs put them somewhere you know and get them you know get them in rehab you know keep them there you know just do not throw them there for three days and then throw them out it is a lot of money being wasted on these kids being placed in these foster homes where nothing is getting accomplished 

Recording: (9522/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9523/ 9621) 
does not bother me at all 

Recording: (9524/ 9621) 
sure <LAUGH> um going into business for myself i need something to sell and selling my own time does not actually seem to be a worthwhile endeavor i have done it i have already done independent consulting ah wherein i set up a contract and said hi you pay me i will do this thing and i go do that thing and you make a lot of money like that problem is you get taxed obscenely like that because you do not have an employer paying half your taxes for you and um there is other bunches of overhead involved and there is the constant cycle of marketing oneself and it all depends on how much you wanna market yourself marketing yourself is easier for some people than for others and it is more fun for some people than for others so so far i do not know if i 

Recording: (9525/ 9621) 
that whole thing 

Recording: (9526/ 9621) 
yeah i guess they do i do not know what where where where it is or how many they have 

Recording: (9527/ 9621) 
i think it is too late i do i 

Recording: (9528/ 9621) 
and call her tammy when she is little 

Recording: (9529/ 9621) 
back there a block so it is right near like lot of other student housing 

Recording: (9530/ 9621) 
no they always have a way to get you out of the car you know like they will order pizza for someplace that is dark <LAUGH> they will be waiting there for YOU <LAUGH> yeah so that is yeah 

Recording: (9531/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9532/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (9533/ 9621) 
oh no no i do not feel that at all they you know we do not hesitate our to get together with other friends and take our kids places i do not remember my dad doing that stuff you know two or three dads get together and take six kids to the park or something you know i do not remember things like that you know he could have been there maybe but 

Recording: (9534/ 9621) 
right that is good 

Recording: (9535/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (9536/ 9621) 
i am gonna let him choose i really am i think as long i mean i really do not care what religion what he is i mean with my husband i really did not care if he turned catholic or not i do think religion is important and whatever that religion is to him and that he has a place to go to pray to be with his family and other people i think that is important if he wants to be catholic great if he does not that is okay too 

Recording: (9537/ 9621) 
but i mean that is just sort of the curious nature of kids i mean they obviously they are gonna get into stuff and things like that and i mean it is not always the parent is fault i mean i there are a lot of people i mean i think just in the news a few weeks ago they had a shooting that happened couple of years ago and they just came to a verdict on it and the parent like left in a top drawer of a tool shed that was locked and the kid knew where the key was he climbed up on the ladder unlocked it and he ended up shooting himself with it i mean as far as that goes i mean there is really nothing more he could do i mean 

Recording: (9538/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9539/ 9621) 
oh projects were right from infancy were i was designing the project first of all we had to find out what we had with the vesture and uh as everyone should know even as a residential user you have to know what you have in your house the telephone company does not provide the service to you anymore well we had to know what we had through out the state of ohio and some eighty eight counties and uh wherever else number of facilities we had and so we went on a scavenger hunt 

Recording: (9540/ 9621) 
the lack of discipline at the home 

Recording: (9541/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9542/ 9621) 
right well that is something i have noticed in the local news particularly they say exclusively on our channel and stuff and it is usually not that big of a deal what they are talking about uh but they are making a big point that you heard it here first and i mean if you hear it five minutes earlier on one station than another what difference does it make 

Recording: (9543/ 9621) 
um but yeah i do not know yeah i think it is like there is like a real like either it is it is old people who are there retiring or whatever or it is more of like a younger people there i do not know you do not see a lot i do not know there is middle aged people there but it is not so apparent like as here i guess 

Recording: (9544/ 9621) 
um it i mean it was pretty good place i mean looking back on it i remembered a lot better than when i was actually there 

Recording: (9545/ 9621) 
yeah but fifty years ago if you had epilepsy they would lock you in closet and throw away the key and would not let you out most the parent i have seen uh to me i would rather see the kids with a step parent 

Recording: (9546/ 9621) 
i worked for a company called highlights for children 

Recording: (9547/ 9621) 
uh it is 

Recording: (9548/ 9621) 
yeah no oh man that was 

Recording: (9549/ 9621) 
well um the one that is um god 

Recording: (9550/ 9621)

Recording: (9555/ 9621) 
i have no IDEA <LAUGH> 

Recording: (9556/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (9557/ 9621) 
right and and you are not as close to your family and the traditions and the and i think you lose all of that and then you get so wrapped up in work and moving that i do not think kids have the center base to the family that they used to have and i do not know the the culture is just so fast paced that i do not think people are maybe it is not honesty maybe it is just they do not have as much time to get attached and they are ready to move on again you just do not get as close to people as you used to 

Recording: (9558/ 9621) 
and you know people do not have big families like they used to you know so 

Recording: (9559/ 9621) 
help them yeah 

Recording: (9560/ 9621) 
<LAUGH> that is just ridiculous too THOUGH but yeah that is to me that is really weird i do not like i said i do not know what they are what they are thinking it orwhat their thought process was but i am thinking maybe it the social because a lot to me a high school is real social 

Recording: (9561/ 9621) 
well that gets back to what you are saying almost th the family life hey what is ahead what you do not need a husband all you need is a sperm bank that is what you are saying are not you are not you 

Recording: (9562/ 9621) 
well um that is i do not know how to explain that ESPECIALLY IF ANYBODYS GONNA LISTEN to this um i had a friend that taught classes human potential classes was very interested and participated very in depth in the human potential movement so um uh a a gentleman by the name of alexander everett uh who really is the father of the human potential movement moved out there and he was gonna have a group of people work out there and uh and he said that you know i was qualified well when we got out there it just fell through you know and we all just lived our lives but i was glad that you know that he got me out there BECAUSE I ADORED IT <LAUGH> i i just loved it out there

Recording: (9565/ 9621) 
think in the case of a tie it should be used but you know like if there is a black woman who is very well qualified for a job and a white male is equally qualified for the job the black woman should get it 

Recording: (9566/ 9621) 
they gave us 

Recording: (9567/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9568/ 9621) 
and uh and the data they collect is just i mean well i mean there are some of those long forms that go into a lot of detail but the basic data has essentially how many people live in the household and what are their ages and race and that is it and that is not a i do not think that is a big secret myself but 

Recording: (9569/ 9621) 
right right tremendous demand right now 

Recording: (9570/ 9621)
