Recording: (8/ 9621) 
right but the ones the racing are the ones that are the standards in the fields but right if i would born more and more of those are also available on the way i would but you have to subscribe to so it is still an institutional subscription i mean that is the constant problem for the serial people everywhere i mean just it is incredible what is happening with the costs you know i mean i have seen articles that say some of them have gone up a thousand dollars a year 

Recording: (9/ 9621) 
but what what does it tell us about our people we are so naive we have got to look inside ourselves and say what can we bring to society that that that could be or ben official and most of the time it is listening 

Recording: (10/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (11/ 9621) 
yeah and makes it you know fun so you can actually see what you know your studying these things does you know you can go a whole season you know seventeen eighteen and oh and nobody pretty much coming close to your standard and when you win all that money it is just like yeah when you lose all of the money it is like that is it <laugh> i am going home <laugh> but i have known people that gamble you know compulsively i mean it is like a gambous level and i could not really get into that number one another that the richest person in the world and number two just a little money here is one thing but when you are out there spending your car insurance money on it i have seen guys do that to get down the side of town and bet the the farm on one horse and would not even do anything for them 

Recording: (12/ 9621) 
i have learned a lot about cooking lately 

Recording: (13/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (14/ 9621) 
so i am trying to take my time do what i want to do yeah 

Recording: (15/ 9621) 
i am a senior and i just started that my art major in spring so i still have about four quarters left but i am a senior 

Recording: (16/ 9621) 
it is 

Recording: (17/ 9621) 
yeah it is projected like six years to take to finish some of these projects i do not know real well i know we just do georgia you actually see people working on the road there is a whole bunch of people and they are all out there working you know and you get to ohio there is that i do not know something on david david letterman had a picture of this and i think i have seen it before that big sign that you are tax dollars at work you know and there is the construction guy smoking a lot of leading up against the side kind of thing <laugh> it is kind of funny 

Recording: (18/ 9621) 
it is just the way it is i guess but it is like you know she says if the mother is in the house the mother is on duty 

Recording: (19/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (20/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (21/ 9621) 
right right but at least we had the stuff outside to look at to keep us interested and and there was a lot of i have always loved to travel by car yeah it is it is fun and it is probably because of that early conditioning <laugh> i have been i have been in forty eight states 

Recording: (22/ 9621) 
no it was his mom ran away so what happened 

Recording: (23/ 9621) 
oh yeah by the 

Recording: (24/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (25/ 9621) 
yeah it is curious is not it 

Recording: (26/ 9621) 
i do not know um like i said i mean it something that i basically see it almost as being the same thing it is like cigarettes or whatever where i mean yeah it is bad for you there is a lot of tar into things like that but as far as what it in effect it does to you it is no worst than anything alcohol can do to you um so i mean i do not know i mean i am not sure if they should actually go as far as to legalize it but i do not think it is really something that they need to really spend that much time kind of controlled drug problem wise the thing is coming in i mean i know i think like switzerland or somewhere like that where they legalize drugs and they basically do a government based where the government actually gives them out and government gets the money for it um i could almost see that as being almost a good idea here i mean obviously like you said people are going to do it no matter what i mean it is the same thing with guns if they want it they will get their hands on it does not matter what they have to do to it they will they will come by it um i mean i actually i mean i could see that they could at least take the money from it and put it to a better use of some sorts if they did the same kind of thing 

Recording: (27/ 9621) 
because not only is he a chevenous pig but he is a big it too <laugh> a reason yeah so 

Recording: (28/ 9621) 
all you do is you just keep your records of of um you know what you spend on things and then there is a form you fill out and how much you have if you have taken need to appreciate you know you need to basically put that back in and deduct your costs and then there is a percentage that goes on your schedule either goes on the front of your form that goes into your income and then it is just taxed it is just a it is really not that hard 

Recording: (29/ 9621) 
i well i hope they keep it 

Recording: (30/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (31/ 9621) 
yeah i really really hate the fact of government trying to what to do 

Recording: (32/ 9621) 
yeah and i said i think the freshman class just right along i think the freshmen would be a little bit tougher you know it would be tougher to beat walking around you know in different areas like me i did not know where this hall was i was out there with fifty million holes around me and just up once and i said there was less and beat in the that way that is too far from our part 

Recording: (33/ 9621) 
and that is the way i felt about it not i am not saying that that is not a possibility but 

Recording: (34/ 9621) 
yeah well like the catalogs real small and we have like five hundred thousand things and like the catalogs has like a hundred of them so that is really another thing too because then people call up with all these like things that we like do not know if we have not our computers are really really old like it is like an old child mainframe 

Recording: (35/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (36/ 9621) 
you tell you it is mine now 

Recording: (37/ 9621) 
oh i yeah exactly i was just wondering how can i get a job doing what you are doing 

Recording: (38/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (39/ 9621) 
or take me to court again you know they got the money i do not 

Recording: (40/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (41/ 9621) 
yes she believes all men will cheat 

Recording: (42/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (43/ 9621) 
actually i was not even that sure that i wanted to do it until um like senior year and the opportunity came up and i said oh sounds cool you know i had thought of my self is a uh chem for a long time and but this opportunity came up yeah i would apply to like other places and i got into university of chicago and i wanted to go there and then just came up up here and although uh it is just ridiculously cheaper here i did not want debt under under crime that is just pathetic um my him figure is kind of found it and he had posted it and he especially um tried to notify it nash from there people about it and i was the only one who really caught it even though the other ones like half of them wanted to go to medical school they all one of them is in printstone right now you know and they are all off of their ivy leagues like basically working their buts off to get in when i am murdered in <laugh> i do not totally understand it 

Recording: (44/ 9621) 
well it 

Recording: (45/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (46/ 9621) 
uh it is all over they contract with dominion homes and dominion is seems like it is going up everywhere in am i so they are all over uh they have projects all over 

Recording: (47/ 9621) 
she just wants to get it over with 

Recording: (48/ 9621) 
he he is in the hard to 

Recording: (49/ 9621) 
yeah it is seventy years old 

Recording: (50/ 9621) 
in their not accurate 

Recording: (51/ 9621) 
i know i i do now when it comes i do not want to touch the computer when i go home 

Recording: (52/ 9621) 
that is true 

Recording: (53/ 9621) 
oh yeah yeah and i i think i think even even if you are aware of everything that is here you still in the back of your mind you just have that it is it is joe columbus it is joe columbus i maybe it is because uh people do not take advantage of do not realize what is actually here uh do not realize how i mean yeah it is not chicago it is not new york it is not there from this point there is a lot of places that it is not but it is uh you know it is not a back water either well they need to get out more <laugh> i mean you know all the oh we will never be a major league city until we have major league sports it well you know i guess uh getting out more would not help those people <laugh> it uh uh that that would be you know that would be such a small part of of civilization anywhere for me and uh i am pretty pleased with the way things are moving along and i just i i i really do think people i will take advantage of it the way they should 

Recording: (54/ 9621) 
really uh-huh i think it is really good for women to learn about this we should have known about this twenty years ago all these woman i know 

Recording: (55/ 9621) 
so she is very limited on working in close corners and stuff like that uh so she is basically unable and that goes when they do that it is because of your education and also they take into consideration everything 

Recording: (56/ 9621) 
which i think is kind of nice so i mean it looks like the facilities are pretty comfortable i mean my biggest thing is i just want to have a room to all to myself you know i do not want to go to some place where i would either have to we deal with something else so i mean it looks it looks nice but i would be more comfortable at home i think once i got home 

Recording: (57/ 9621) 
i never learned math <laugh> we had in the fifth grade we had the principal realize that nobody knew they were times tables you know big pizza party plans right 

Recording: (58/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (59/ 9621) 
hum in person is at all on this well number one i did not realize that it was as big as it is until i started working for the career service you know i have heard people say and i know it is true that columbus this is one of the top ten larger cities in the united states and i was like you are kidding me really i started driving around and i am like yeah it is <laugh> it is like huge so i said that is what he he mess i mean everything within two seventy it is it is pretty darn big and um that was really surprising um i love i just lovelyly one of the big city uh it is just it is just everything is so different than living in the country you mean i miss the big expenses of grass out in the country country but i can ski all over the place here in town which i can not do at home i mean i could ski down our driveway but it stopsbs and broops and in stones <laugh> so it gets real boring i mean going down hills is really fun but going back up spain in the back but um uh there is no more people here i i like lots of people i have discovered and i have gotten lots of people around meeting all sorts of new and interesting people nue people and every year and there is a whole new crowd of freshman that come in and you know it is pretty cool yep <laugh> it is enjoyable i like it i do not know if i will stay here i know i would not raise a family here but no i mean actuallyland is the perfect place to raise family but that is about it <laugh> and i mean i do not even know how any of the actually that is actually university it is one of the it is got one of the best a bunch of some seminars in the us and it is a republican pink thing think think <laugh> it is republican think tank so aside from the college the town is pretty much agricultural i do not know i do not know why anybody would want to live there unless they are raising a family because if they are raising a family it is a great place great community just great all around for reason family oh no i wanna find i wanna find someplace similar to that i wanna find someplace in the middle of that in colorado yeah although colorado beautiful state that is not good skiing <laugh> yeah skating skiing that is how i did this for my ucla two years ago christmas day after christmas so is uh is uh tending right uh right in the front of your knee that keeps yeah it keeps your it keeps it keeps your knee from moving out and doing all sorts of other miscellaneous too justing returning position that it is not really supposed to but i rip that right in half <laugh> what i do in theimproveous well for one this place is dirty if you are from the france it is it is just so 

Recording: (60/ 9621) 
well i often have to write on papers i believe you turned in the wrong paper i believe i got the rough draft instead of the final copy do you have the final copy somewhere at home um-hum 

Recording: (61/ 9621) 
yeah ellen atlane avenue has been a big boost of my work i mean i was really lucky to run across her 

Recording: (62/ 9621) 
it does 

Recording: (63/ 9621) 
and he could not have any kind of coffee in other ways he would get the shake and he took all kinds of pills 

Recording: (64/ 9621) 
yeah so that is taking some running around 

Recording: (65/ 9621) 
um i think some of it was that i think a lot of it is you do feel lonely um you do go through a period in your life where you do not feel like you have any friends or you feel totally different i mean i still cover that i think we all go through that at some point or another even yearly for some of us um so i am just saying if he felt like he could go to somebody either in his family i say he using those for example or the parents paid a little bit more attention and did not have that blind eye i think that is part of your responsibility is apparently that if you see something potentially evil or long doing in your child is eyes you need to really admit it um i mean you do not want to do that but 

Recording: (66/ 9621) 
no no i am i am interested 

Recording: (67/ 9621) 
the lower grades we have a few male teachers at first grade and fourth grade but not many but i think that young men young boys would do better in uh setting in school if they had a a man earlier on rather than having to wait till they are in middle school to relate to a coach and up and so then it is always been a woman 

Recording: (68/ 9621) 
and this way it comes to die so 

Recording: (69/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (70/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (71/ 9621) 
you know my daughter you know there is just a lot of stuff when she was in high school and i would call up to the school and you know the principal was like he he said you know i am at i am her last chance you know my daughter was going to summer school every summer and he is like mrs is you know she is like you know the average student uh she is the type you know that she is going to get you know she is got going to get through college you know she is just one of those you know that just news right along you know she is not that bright enough you know but she is bright enough and those are your average professional people out working today and i just like well i just want more help for my daughter you know i just want somebody to you know jerk her down 

Recording: (72/ 9621) 
well that is great 

Recording: (73/ 9621) 
you they had to uh they just called me on the phone not knowing you know just that she went to the hospital well they said to me will you stay well i said yes but then uh and when it got in to two weeks and i was not getting any support from the principal or no aid or anything it is like i am sorry i am a substitute <laugh> substitute i am getting sixty dollars a day i can not do this and this you know i have more help and i just flatly said that i am sorry i mean if i would if it was my own job i would have strangled with it but it was not my own job and i did not know what was gonna happen so if they would have gotten some hope been there for me i would have stayed perhaps but now i i you know you can work for under pay and under staff and every age you can not do everything so oh 

Recording: (74/ 9621) 
uh frightening or and stuff like that and uh towards all i would have to do is get on the phone and sit there and say you know i can be out there in about two hours you know so i do not know what your problem is but you need to get you to talk to me about talking to my mom about that grocery somebody else and talk to them about it 

Recording: (75/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (76/ 9621) 
and decide to go back to the jobs if you noticed the first time they voted they voted down the proposal the proposal that they are voting on this week is the exact same one 

Recording: (77/ 9621) 
and i am just used to that as an example you know i mean your other drugs i do not know much about them 

Recording: (78/ 9621) 
they could do it and my my one greata daughter uh they live in springfield they just move to springfield and she goes to kindergarten inly a half day and this child is only uh five years old uh he has them reading the newspaper over watching the news she told me a story about christopher columbus uh discovering in america that was so deep and intense i could not believe it was coming from a five year old so this is what the teacher is doing down there 

Recording: (79/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (80/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (81/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (82/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (83/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (84/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (85/ 9621) 
no there was a lot of conflict at home uh my dad uh had to support us uh there were four of us in the uh there has disabilitiesities and uh she was kind of crazy 

Recording: (86/ 9621) 
i think it is probably too though that a lot of people have are not used to it i mean they are not from ohio i have found that in columbus a lot so they are kind of you know more tentative or they from the south or something like that so they and then you run into a lot of people that are from ohio but i have noticed that a lot of people rarely need people born and raising columbus so 

Recording: (87/ 9621) 
oh okay that was easy 

Recording: (88/ 9621) 
and he is real because people give him that 

Recording: (89/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (90/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (91/ 9621) 
you know so basically well yeah it might work what you means kind of stupid you know because what you are saying is we are going to take this lawn we are really going to stick you on this lawn but to hell with all the other oh so is that really fair 

Recording: (92/ 9621) 
that is great 

Recording: (93/ 9621) 
oh is that right 

Recording: (94/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (95/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (96/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (97/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (98/ 9621) 
um he he is a subcontractor if uh someone is got a job to do at their house he he will do it you know like we we just went and tore the cabinets out of the a house that was on fire and because of smoke damage 

Recording: (99/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (100/ 9621) 
all of his problems have been personal problems that really should not have been touched on except the media got into it and um i mean we look up to the president to be a moral man whatever but if you look at the other nations they were not that shocked that a president would do something like that 

Recording: (101/ 9621) 
yeah i do not 

Recording: (102/ 9621) 
boy that is a that is a really tough one i had not i had not thought about that and and high school kids are so touchy about i mean about touching about sexualident and and so likely you know so innoccure in their own that they are really likely to come down hard on somebody who has i had a different or in msdow i do not know i do not know 

Recording: (103/ 9621) 
i went to uh um that just about just a little uh east of here high school 

Recording: (104/ 9621) 
he works in a factory <laugh> 

Recording: (105/ 9621) 
uh all this years after i left school here was the the bureau of employment services i worked with uh twenty years with uh resegeing statistics uh federal state programs collecting information on three different programs in that time then they worked for uh about a year and a half on a special project uh they were automating the employment services activities and they were going a complete direction to match job needs as employers and applications to get more placement for interviews and this sort of thing and i developed that method uh the mechanism and the checkless and stuff i do to put it worked on that uh and then i worked for the last three years in jobs training uh for economic disadvantages to youth adults and duplicate workers 

Recording: (106/ 9621) 
and one of them they talked down to columbus was uh how well he was doing in school well children you off have a high one of the highest dropout down to rates and school they are not doing well so they need to be taught differently and then they cut this money so my my feeling is you know there is a lot of programs in school that sponsored by and federal government particularly uh to help the students are that are behind and they it is important 

Recording: (107/ 9621) 
when they are giving a four or five thousand dollar a year to someone who is making two hundred three hundred thousand dollars i do not care if i get five dollars that will not even buy me a tank of gas today keep the money and do something good good weather 

Recording: (108/ 9621) 
that is fine i do not my husband does but i kind of sleep between them when they are but right now i have because we have early on we took our bed down and just kind of had like the bench or something about spring on the floor and i have got like comforters on the side of the bed so because he is like ake he will they get out he is like i do not want to be in the bed with these guys and he will get on the floor and he will sleep on the comforters on the floor but he is close and he is be that way <laugh> um-hum 

Recording: (109/ 9621) 
yeah it is hopefully 

Recording: (110/ 9621) 
you have a preference of five or six but by the time you turn eight one of your hemisphere is pretty much decided it is going to be the one that runs the show well then and that is when those reverseals and all that back yard fives and trees and stuff usually drops out of the picture so hm 

Recording: (111/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (112/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (113/ 9621) 
i travel has been all i even for the transportation turn i travel across the state and country and before that was always traveling we took two two weeks off when we went back to the fall semester back then it is semesters and out quarters and uh uh we would get on the freehound bus for our pass but then i would just travel over the country and sleep in the bus tonight 

Recording: (114/ 9621) 
and it it is wild it just seems like the music has not gone anywhere because they keep going back to the seventy menor the rolling stones going to our pink floyd or you know these are groups from back where are these people they are supposed to have taken over for these people they are not there you know and the quality of the music just must not be there uh my daughter is into the brittany spieres and uh um uh uh back street boys in the sink all this and now we are starting to get into some of that that is starting to get a little interest i do not know as far as music choices and wanting to live and get them come down to sony walkman and and you do not have to listen to it <laugh> they did not have that one we were getting paid for i remember our car had an am radio and that was it <laugh> yeah yeah yeah on an album and then now the kids are like i want the cd put the cd in yeah yeah 

Recording: (115/ 9621) 
uh in insurance off and on working for independent insurance agents so i did that until i uh came to a company that i stayed with for seven years and then they re little okay to dallas so yeah 

Recording: (116/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (117/ 9621) 
yeah and it is like no one more than the union and that is like it is such a disturbing fact to me that you could take someone is life and be like oh our bad that person was innocent you know 

Recording: (118/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (119/ 9621) 
huhuh 

Recording: (120/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (121/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (122/ 9621) 
hum 

Recording: (123/ 9621) 
and what what he he is too busy 

Recording: (124/ 9621) 
that is 

Recording: (125/ 9621) 
you know in a way and how you would have one nowadays 

Recording: (126/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (127/ 9621) 
one of the he has the most experience 

Recording: (128/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (129/ 9621) 
because you know they they bypass me and street mom mom them 

Recording: (130/ 9621) 
uh yeah my parents live in akron uh like north backer back in kind of falls area but like i said i my i had apartments down there and but like for the summer i am down here so i am a last uh 

Recording: (131/ 9621) 
you know just by where you are going why do you just waste all your time running around like that 

Recording: (132/ 9621) 
so we did it it well he is always had some problems his uh his problem i am saying focused on things unless it is something he is extremely interested in then you can get them away from it um if it is something he would be it is just an example in cool he would sit there and he would be rolling around on the floor and stuff while they are trying to teach something in the class or it is working on a riding oh something uh a half hour to work on him he would his wife five minutes the teacher said you know you really need to get that done he would sit down and write it in the fifth grade he was reading on a college level and he could do it that quickly uh i think he is lost his ground on that now but and that was just an example in the second grade this guy he went to was an open classroom and uh uh he had been to some a couple of the traditional schools already and the principal is we told the principal talk to the principal about the problems they are having with him saying so so she said well we can work with them as a half way through the year she says it is not working and they have an arrangement with and i doubt if most people in the school the parents in the school are going to work just with children is hospital counseling so they set a room of sight and they send counselors in once a month to work with the students it is open classroom it is experimental says people coming and going on uh we were never aware of it i doubt for most of the people are aware of it and they met with us and then a week later they went and then served him and he was they were the teacher was telling me i asked him questions about it and said he was the counselor said he was up and walking around and running around and playing with his shoes and stuff like that and she said but have came to answer course i see knew every answer so they said he they they decided not to perceive at that time because uh this is frustrating to you it was a running anniversary in a so i said now how about for a winning anniversary we just get a good report for the whole week that that was unusual and he was not a bad kid 

Recording: (133/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (134/ 9621)

you will you will know it is neat by the 

Recording: (138/ 9621) 
borderish country 

Recording: (139/ 9621) 
and a lot of them have been getting off the hook lately you see this guy on uh hard copy he kills this woman is husband because he is in love with her and they ended up letting him go because he was supposedly capable of making his own decisions now i think that there is there is uh things in your brain that trigger ideas and if you have a wide a wider version of what they i do not know what they call it it is in that magazine there it is what trigger the violence and violence thought people actually do think more about the violence when they commit it than the accidental you know some of it is money unless some of it is not but everybody thinks 

Recording: (140/ 9621) 
professors yeah uh well as i mentioned a while ago i happen to have i am a one of fifteenablyings 

Recording: (141/ 9621) 
it is a great experience they really even when you know we were having problems with him and stuff it was great uh he could not understand you know my wife was not so you know it something about spending time together she she said that there is no time that we spend with you that is wasted and he you could not understand that she said you mean this is fun i saw i did not say it was fun <laugh>

Recording: (187/ 9621)

Recording: (191/ 9621)

Recording: (193/ 9621) 
the way i feel 

Recording: (194/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (195/ 9621) 
right after high school i think there was probably i will say six and amazingly ah well three were still together 

Recording: (196/ 9621)

Recording: (198/ 9621) 
china we just had a van who took time to 

Recording: (199/ 9621) 
oh okay 

Recording: (200/ 9621) 
um wow that is nice yeah i am sure 

Recording: (201/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (202/ 9621) 
that is true 

Recording: (203/ 9621) 
uh they uh stopped federal way funding uh was you that was the federal control power and they contracted it out so you either lost your job and stayed there and worked for the contract bacter or you picked up and moved on and you know some people move like to arizona and california and and i thought well since i have like two and a half years until i retire and i really like columbus and i thought i do not want to root uproot my daughter is out of school and and leave and start over so that is why i will just go to poor columbus and suffer it out until i can 

Recording: (204/ 9621) 
so i guess you i mean that one well that was really really hard for me i will just call all my family members i had family members coming over to try to figure out what child needed but i do not know i could not tell you what he went through with that crime spell but he did go to that where he just then got quick crime 

Recording: (205/ 9621) 
i try to be as much as possible to i think it is very important that both parents they see both 

Recording: (206/ 9621) 
the very fair area from the south east london 

Recording: (207/ 9621) 
city council of dayton and had highlighted a whole bunch of it and hoping that uh they would do something along that line and should of going to clim this at the same time interesting 

Recording: (208/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (209/ 9621) 
yeah and i really think both of them will be good parents someday but she says we are not ready 

Recording: (210/ 9621) 
my dad seems to think i should go into law because there is law and everything you can do anything with a law degree 

Recording: (211/ 9621) 
well personally i voted that the thirty three should pass i think they should the way i and understood i they have ways of working those things you catch a reed very currently i said yes or no one thing i suggest it just because i uh analyze it to say that they are repealing something was past i think one or two years ago that was allowing things to be done up around the poor areas area like new roads and this and that and i want that repe because i do not think we should be helping anybody else to do that and taking the money away from the other thing 

Recording: (212/ 9621) 
oh my god 

Recording: (213/ 9621) 
they are just like it a little less or just like it a little more when when it it looks like it is gonna come to something it looks like they are it feels like they are trying to tease me as an audience and uh i i that is not something i feel teased by particularly 

Recording: (214/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (215/ 9621) 
kind 

Recording: (216/ 9621) 
been even think about asking 

Recording: (217/ 9621) 
yeah i i saw it in the beginning i missed mary lake cafe so bad just had the good subs and all that i do not i do not know why i missed them i do not i go back and i just do not like it any more

Recording: (219/ 9621) 
whenever he runs well i thought he was going to be elected uh mayor to but he did not there but i do not know what that was about but uh uh you know he is got his constituents and they are going to reelect him because he stands up for the minority i think he well he makes a mistake as say labeled things races that are not necessarily races but anyway 

Recording: (220/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (221/ 9621) 
yeah it is just like uh having alcohol around i mean gambling is a lot like alcohol can be addicted it could screw your life up and you will spend your last dollar on it if you are that far gone so pretty much anything can be one of those factors <laugh> yeah 

Recording: (222/ 9621) 
um i would agree that i think regardless of your race you should be able to adopt child i mean just because your black kid living with like a white family does not mean you can not still have your heritage or whatever to be proud of i mean at the same thing with like i heard people adopting like italian babies or something like that i mean it is no different i mean as long as basically you know your roots and where you came from i mean i can not see a being a problem of many sorts um i mean just as long as they have someone that care is for the kid and does this stuff for them i mean i can not see them being any 

Recording: (223/ 9621) 
i personally agree with that but that is just from my own moral belief if and everything but i do not know i i do not think that there is one solution that will fit every every child in every situation i mean my husband had his daughter when he was seventeen so you know obviously his he said his dad told him about condombs you know so they are gonna make that decision on their own i would say just and and plus with the inner not in everything they they have access to so much information i i think that it falls back on the parents still if you are going to be y up here it you need to be responsible and i do not think that it is getting done 

Recording: (224/ 9621) 
i know 

Recording: (225/ 9621) 
um in general i think i think the united states has fairly well developed like class not like class structured in which you can not move up or down but like we have a a fairly large middle class

Recording: (284/ 9621) 
you do not go into elementary ed that much 

Recording: (285/ 9621) 
well i i enjoy it <laugh> but it it will be imperson uh because here you are i am not camped issue i do not i do not know whether you are really kidding me what you are talking about i was sitting there in that in that uh street cafe or not but i really do think we are going to be disconnected in that and and it becomes so much more imperson i guess i am very strong about the putterner personal versus impersonal or any communications uh and the bed that we have talked about i think will be a part of that ten and twenty years from now but i think we will have they gone by that time to try to clean up the act if you will uh going back to the part political question i think the financial things that i think we will start we will start slowing that down i think we will have less influence in in terms of thewow i do not think we will get back to abram lincoln days but uh if we have been swing our pendulum back uh i think we i think we can i think we will i do now that over time what we would have called bad back here is not necessarily bad here it is sort of like the definition of need versus luxury uh there is definitely a change the definition of socialism democracy they should only have changed over these times well the same thing will true be true of those it still function <laugh> excuse me um and i think we will also slowly swing i think and on back to the and to the family again there are those doing the same there will not be such a thing as a family uh it is just you you go out here you need a an opposite sex you pro createin you going your way she goes on her way and she is just satisfied about going her way as you are going your way um it yes a lot of that is true but i think that uh i think that i do not think that is going to ever happen i think we will turn that thing around i think as so cold divorce rate program as i talked about a while ago i uh every or fifty percent of the people who marry within five years are no longer together i think that will will change and that is a very significant thing i think in terms of getting back to the basic family

Recording: (290/ 9621) 
and the fact that i recognized all that and could not wait to get out of there and when i was gone i was gone and and even now we still have this ongoing thing where my in fact i have been real happy about them lately because um i have we have lived in our same house for twenty years and my parents they they live in florida they um i mean they are not well to do by any means but they they are not liking for anything and they could afford to take plane trips and they could afford to go to california twice a year to they would spend the week with my brother et cetera et cetera and they come here a couple times a year and they stay at my sister is house they have only come to my home three times in twenty years and it is because they do not wanna get off the freeway they will drive through columbus from florida to go to visit people in in akren and massland and they stay in cincinnati and they stay in spring feel with my sisters and they will not do it because it is just too they do not want to have to deal with that traffic they do not like that and it and just recently i finally instead you know i do not understand why you can not do that you know i have actually called them up i am fifty two 

Recording: (291/ 9621) 
i would say there would be certain life application things that all kids should know but not i do not will think that you can say everything you know you have to everybody has to do this because you know people are individuals and you have to take that into consideration i think so 

Recording: (292/ 9621) 
i know 

Recording: (293/ 9621) 
yeah it was <laugh> 

Recording: (294/ 9621) 
well i really think that is happening right now because i think that i do not know what the divorce statistics have been recently but i do see that more people who are getting back married or staying married because those that do not those that would have gotten the divorce they are not bothering to get married to begin with they are just living together and then they separate so what and i think that 

Recording: (295/ 9621) 
um i talk to them every now and then 

Recording: (296/ 9621) 
you know white nap cans and you know we would go there for lunch you know you would dress nice and uh you know i i like that and i would uh like you know my grandkids to be able to go downtown with me like that you know rather than have to drive off to a mall 

Recording: (297/ 9621) 
yeah that part was no different i mean 

Recording: (298/ 9621) 
they had a two by four on the door for over a month 

Recording: (299/ 9621) 
no that that go over the wall here would not it 

Recording: (300/ 9621) 
so they call 

Recording: (301/ 9621) 
i mean he would have he would have been in the money then because he is just starting his business down there and uh while while i was down there he had tad me sleeping in a truck a moving truck and uh all me it is it is a hilarious story i mean thirty foot moving truck i am sleeping in it and i get uh 

Recording: (302/ 9621) 
now who does he work for 

Recording: (303/ 9621) 
and some of that is controlled with medication now but not all of it because they because of the drug and alcohol they will not put them on some of the medication so but as far as i can oh he is been pretty clear and clean on that and uh you know once she got pregnant they both stopped smoking she is taking very good care of herself she uh she lately has been going with him to psychology and uh uh we have been paying for it but we do not have a problem with that because he is quick <laugh> he likes the psychologist so took a long time to get to that point but uh so we have been talking to the psychologist about it they said she he said most people are raised in that back i am used to go different ways ones they they just fall into the same uh patternous appearance or they are surviving she appears to be a surviving uh she is never really had what i would call a normal family relationship she likes to spend time with us uh which i am glad uh and she we really like her she is really we enjoy being with her but sometimes me more than being with my son uh 

Recording: (304/ 9621) 
so i i try to gear what he watches towards educational programming instead of just junk <laugh> 

Recording: (305/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (306/ 9621)

it is like down to hill kind of by the horse yeah so that is where we go and i do not have any student ideas i just sneak them but it is the summer they do not even care they never 

Recording: (312/ 9621) 
i think i think they should um i think a lot of the fear of this material comes uh from people who hold the belief that that you choose your oriyou can be converted to homosexual you know i personally do not believe that so it i you know i am not afraid of it but i can see how people would hold the opposite view and that i that is where this comes comes from but since i think they are wrong <laugh> i think it should be my and i think i think you know i think the material should be there i think it you know dealt with in a common reasonable way and i think it should be accessible to the kids 

Recording: (313/ 9621) 
yeah yeah i heard something about that 

Recording: (314/ 9621) 
i retired about uh four years ago from the state i worked there for thirty years actually i started working for the state when i school here i worked here and that this five years coming towards retirement so i was able to retire early and then uh last uh about the last two and a half years i have been working at the symphony and then the boss saw office started parttime and then i was full time for a while and then i request they would cut back to parttime again because uh 

Recording: (315/ 9621) 
i am i am going to keep doing the same stuff you know i will find some other kids somewhere else and i will have some time you know my husband and i have time together and i they always find some they always have a project you know it is like i am always saying well when things slow down around here i am going to like right now i should be home counting money for the i i did a fund raiser for the the school and we were um we just sell it more like indian racking paper and all that kind of stuff and our sales are where from twenty five thousand to forty thousand dollars then so we get half of that for the profit and i i do that to myself but that also means that i have thousand thousand dollars just right through a right going to recycle so but anyhow i am always seeing one it slows down but then i always we will find another project so and i rehab houses whenever i get a chance i like to do that so 

Recording: (316/ 9621) 
hum 

Recording: (317/ 9621) 
humum 

Recording: (318/ 9621) 
okay does is it like a less that kind of spanish oh are they uh 

Recording: (319/ 9621) 
i i run a uh big fan uh i think one of the big problems is going to be uh uh initially just the uh uh the monitor thing of the you know the people that supported the uh basically supported the uh uh minor league team that they had here you know like blue collar people with a he could go for twenty thirty bucks and have a good time get drunk of beer and and up there you know you are not going to be able to do that as a good time you uh and then another fifty to a hundred dollars probably to take her to the same way a couple of kids or something like that you know 

Recording: (320/ 9621) 
or anything like that i mean that is something that i do not know i would sort of make known to them but not something that i would really put they shown him 

Recording: (321/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (322/ 9621) 
actually i that is what got me interested in so i went to library school and

Recording: (325/ 9621) 
and i have been on both worlds <laugh> 

Recording: (326/ 9621) 
it would not publicize to the a degree than it is now it seems like anymore or nothing you the second i mean as far as the papers are concerned and uh that is something else that i i guess i am old fashioned but i do not think we need all this publicity about all uh sexual death aids of all the people that are motorright or have yesot aous lives uh they just uh i am the same mb i am old station today and they i can hardly conceive anyone being a genuinely homosexual i mean evidently they are but uh it is still against human nature i think or against conventional human terenty way 

Recording: (327/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (328/ 9621) 
she helped a lot 

Recording: (329/ 9621)

Recording: (333/ 9621) 
we took um or i took uh military ethnic of the philosophy of course and that was really interesting because even though in even in that high a working there is still certain contacts within the contact of war for instance if if we both know if we knowing they go into it as combat is and we are fighting for whatever cause but if we both are willingness going into it 

Recording: (334/ 9621)

Recording: (342/ 9621) 
hm 

Recording: (343/ 9621) 
um i it i think it depends on the child and i think it depends on the adult as far as the supervision of it and uh we are very strict as far as what games they have no you know it is so wild you know when we were kids californians and indians everybody had guns everybody you know if you had the best death act you were the the best you know and now just as hope do not let him have a gun you know do not let him play with you know even a squirt gun you know and so you wonder whether it is overexasurated or you know none of us grew up shooting people or this you know we do not own in fire our up and we played with guns and played him out of these games and so i just wonder whether this is really you know but society is a lot different now 

Recording: (344/ 9621) 
yeah they are going to most likely raise it up to twenty one since all these uh they kentucky and maryland color broadado all their school shootings and can not believe in i mean there is articles in there you would not even believe if you have not read them 

Recording: (345/ 9621) 
most my friends

um-hum i get sick so often they need to ask about allergies or even just have a little minor test that they can take when people when they can not figure out which wrong with them because a lot of times it is a allergic reaction to the things they have eaten 

Recording: (347/ 9621) 
so like uh there is like a there a large american population say well i think i want to just you know like you know yeah you it is like cause this to follow this but sometimes you know well just want to hang out what do you get with your own so is you know yeah the is that already probably that is just money you know people from the states 

Recording: (348/ 9621) 
there are a lot of teenagers that we are cutting that much weight if not more they were pretty much doing it for the team 

Recording: (349/ 9621)

Recording: (356/ 9621) 
um aids being one of them

oh 

Recording: (359/ 9621) 
so that is mainly it is probably more for fishing 

Recording: (360/ 9621) 
do i think they will oh yes i think they definitely will i think there is so much heavy uh political and financial well i am a reverse that statement uh there is so much heavy financial infoluents upon the political uh influence that it it is almost a four gone conclusion and if it does not occur this within this year and uh there may be another vote in another year or in the in the next election but i think that in fact it will go 

Recording: (361/ 9621) 
some times she in mary had more disagreements than i have read with her 

Recording: (362/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (363/ 9621) 
well the humans is started it and the man narrowating the thing said there was not a single animal that they profile anything that uh uh um behave the way it did on it is own accord 

Recording: (364/ 9621) 
yeah i think it does course we were fiddling with that so much and <laugh> 

Recording: (365/ 9621) 
no i do not want them to get together i love the attention they get together at the bed whenever they get up like any of their like five or six amples where it looks like they are going to hook up and that one where they was like uh a a duplicateate molder 

Recording: (366/ 9621) 
um actually i think it needs to probably start younger than that 

Recording: (367/ 9621) 
well i see growing up we did not have we it was not really called sex ed um they talked about the female a productive system nothing had about men which is kind of funny you know it was always the women in that sharp you know 

Recording: (368/ 9621) 
she said you know what they say now and i would read me hand and put six she said four 

Recording: (369/ 9621)

Recording: (372/ 9621) 
definitely 

Recording: (373/ 9621)

Recording: (374/ 9621)

so that is just the means i get to hear more of my book 

Recording: (376/ 9621) 
i know the same cake at mine would have been like seven dollars or something like that and you know but uh you know i am i do not try to be that that cheaply i mean i will not go without health plan or anything like that but you know they are certainly like my car i love cars and you know you take the car to car washington it is like seven fifty or eight bucks and you wash the driveway and it is about a quarter you know it is like it takes time if you if you have no time and you know that i i have friends at work that their the mom is a taxi cab driveer and the dad is the worker bee and when they get home they do not want to do anything so they pay it at the yard done they do this but other that it is like they have then they always go we have no money and it is like because you pay to do everything you know slow your life down a little bit you know it is like you making your soup you know when if and when you have children when they get my age they are going to go i can remember walking around the house and going mom is making soop for mom is making vegetable soup her mom baked the cake it is like as opposed to opening up oh here is a mar cake you know 

Recording: (377/ 9621) 
that is all right yeah 

Recording: (378/ 9621) 
and they are more hyper about like you know bad thing for people to do you know that the during game of smoking there is not as strict about in basically 

Recording: (379/ 9621) 
kind of like they say i do not i do not believe that homosexuality is taught uh i think the kid will grow up in this girl or grow old and be just fine 

Recording: (380/ 9621) 
uh where we put all kinds of information out on our own web site which is very hard to find what you want you know it is that is a some problem with information is the more you put out there the harder it is to find what you want but if you can not get to it if it is not out there you can not find it uh it it get is a problem for us for the library is because there is just a barage of what they are getting and it is not just from us it is from the literature uh there is literally the you know hundreds of library publications uh and it is a problem the librarianians are facing all the time they can not keep up 

Recording: (381/ 9621) 
uh i was raised your most of my life 

Recording: (382/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (383/ 9621) 
i 

Recording: (384/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (385/ 9621) 
so uh they got us kids actually and time but they did not i mean they 

Recording: (386/ 9621) 
oh and this is about you got it over three years 

Recording: (387/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (388/ 9621) 
the other one just they did not really well 

Recording: (389/ 9621) 
a little bit yeah 

Recording: (390/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (391/ 9621) 
that is perfect 

Recording: (392/ 9621) 
they uh what they 

Recording: (393/ 9621) 
no i have not been paying a lot of attention to it just because i do not know 

Recording: (394/ 9621) 
so i am very embarrassedous i am so sorry and the guy is like uh nobody else is eaten this you might as <laugh> 

Recording: (395/ 9621) 
which was now you see what those guns all are all right with their within tin tin yards with the head was a tore and because he had one of those things thirty seven pounds of tin teag off of the i am tin yard so i <laugh> 

Recording: (396/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (397/ 9621) 
and the way he was writing right now he is really interested in eastern religions i am not sure where that came from you know when they go to college and they are gone you do not see him much uh that is what he is interested in right now so i do not think it it it it really took 

Recording: (398/ 9621) 
well he told a jewish friend of mine that her grandparents that died in the holy cost went to hell because they were jewish 

Recording: (399/ 9621) 
is that right 

Recording: (400/ 9621) 
because i have seen more violence on our car seeing more women beat i have seeing more kids beat i have seen more drunk in driving racks 

Recording: (401/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (402/ 9621) 
and their needs were immediate 

Recording: (403/ 9621) 
it so i just see a pattern you know and i just feel like this is going to happen to me eventually 

Recording: (404/ 9621) 
i was going to say i i have seen situations too where i can see their side of it as well because the mothers are used to or the wives are used to be at home and the husband support him in the the situations they still want them to they still do not want to go out there and do that and um and you know they need to look at each one of those cases too because i know there is out alimony and all that kind of thing and that can be if you can never go out and have another life or have it on their wife and you know 

Recording: (405/ 9621) 
oh really where are you from 

Recording: (406/ 9621) 
being cut um i think the fact that things like at responsibility maybe a long time ago people stayed married because they felt like they had a responsibility to take care of of their family i mean and you can be divorced and still take care of your family instead of uh you know think as far as people getting paid and then and then this person goes off and and we have then you have got a lot of unmarried single women that are all by themselves and and it is just it is more especially acceptable to to be able to do these things now than they think it was or in time ago i mean people is families would would never stand for something like that they would say look you need to take care of this you need to deal with this and now it is just it is kind of horrible and everybody just kind of goes along with it 

Recording: (407/ 9621) 
el all the kids in the world all that that will happen do that that influence all the kids 

Recording: (408/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (409/ 9621) 
right <laugh> 

Recording: (410/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (411/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah see they are going to be fine to house we want our we will go build it some way 

Recording: (412/ 9621) 
yeah i think they do 

Recording: (413/ 9621) 
not that not that i have seen you know 

Recording: (414/ 9621)

Recording: (415/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (416/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (417/ 9621) 
i am an independent 

Recording: (418/ 9621) 
um in in trying to stop it uh am trying to think of some good examples i mean when politicians and since they are talking about like biological functions 

Recording: (419/ 9621) 
yeah it is a tour it is a package tour uh you know from the wrong floorin so it then it is these uh yeah that does not interest me 

Recording: (420/ 9621) 
exactly yeah 

Recording: (421/ 9621) 
it was a law enforcement career and i mean 

Recording: (422/ 9621) 
oh it is sort of like the sociology of like quicks you know like how how that develops like how people like some people seek to like fit in like like the pets are real strong uh like 

Recording: (423/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (424/ 9621) 
and how are you and i know like one point in time it is like we do not want to hang out with you crystal i am like we will find out i do not care <laugh> i will go hang out with them <laugh> it is like they they still need to do a lot of growing up 

Recording: (425/ 9621) 
uh yeah they uh near near west side is always been a pretty bad area now from the last forty or fifty years and it is starting to creep with 

Recording: (426/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (427/ 9621) 
yeah that is true we went oh and she is they have got a nice facility i mean they have a a uh like a labor in the living room that is got like it is weird though because when you go they show you you they they talk about all this world pull back thing a room it is i do not know if you have heard of those commercials or not but they there is only one room that is like that 

Recording: (428/ 9621) 
and that is really an important issue right now i i i saw that the first time in nineteen ninety two because i uh i have not said it yet but you know anyone who is listening to this tape you would be able to know i am a democrat and generally vote democratic although i will tell you i i did vote for group regular shock of once and if he had run again i would have voted for him because i like his style and he has not been back for the city but um i am generally a democrat uh and i have only voted for two people who won the presidential election and i knew in ninety two early on that clint was going to win just by being out with people and i was at a restaurant one time with my girlfriend and a waiter came up and uh he said something about you know and i can not remember how we got started on the topic you know just taking my my order for restaurant but he said something about um uh dole was too old and this is a young guy he was in college and i knew there was but there is a a a sort of a shift people wanted someone with younger ideas and uh a new vision they did not want the world war two vision anymore uh and i thought that was was kind of interesting because by and large most young people also supported reagan and i thought do they really understand different in issues in what the two stand for but it was that reagan appears young and care of the aerage voter that does have uh a lot of sway 

Recording: (429/ 9621) 
oh the vegetables in the summer that they have downtown i mean those are these are really great and they are you know i mean they are they are crowded but they are peaceful you know there is not righting in the streets and there is a lot to do and great you know great music 

Recording: (430/ 9621) 
really and it is a fun job but really is i i have only ever known one male that taught first grade uh new one guy that taught third most of the time if they go into elementary ed they go for the upper grades like four or five or six but uh i really think that if we let the boys be more exposed to men earlier than they would be more motivated to learn because they would see that it is not just a girly thing they would say oh well mister so and so things that is important that i know this and he is a real macho guide so i better learn it you know i do i really do nowadays with the pay being better we are getting more men but 

Recording: (431/ 9621) 
um-hum

well my son started yeah son started in public school for kindergarten and he just my son is my son is a very social however say he is the one that talks too much <laugh> it is a teacher say he is a social child he talks too much he likes to get up and run around and he needs something very structured i mean he needs time to run around but he needs something very structured you getting near a bunch of other kids when he was little and it was like he would just run and scream at them because he was ready to play well yeah and yeah my and my daughter my daughter is the opposite of that uh but he would do that and so he was not he was very front he was not learning things and he was constantly getting in trouble and it is like i i do not know we would be told he was a problem but he did not understand what was going on and they were they was not in structure he would go to school every day and they would not know what to expect because i was not like this we will do this and then we will do this and we will do this so we checked out the catholic school and they were organized that way and it just was a better better match for him and then but my daughter went to school was just easier to take him to the same school and and they goes back to and they in front of me with another thing i want to say about my discipline and and behavior maybe different in the catholic schools you paying big you paying bucks you know it is a fourth out forty five hundred dollars a year for us to send her to school uh and if we find out she is not i mean at work very different perspective 

Recording: (471/ 9621)

Recording: (472/ 9621) 
is it oh that is a good day 

Recording: (473/ 9621) 
yes for attention and uh yeah 

Recording: (474/ 9621) 
um-hum um-hum but i do not know that that i think the divorce rate has gone up because it is more socially acceptable i am sure there is plenty of people twenty years ago that would have loved to have got a divorce had that been an option um i i think it just i think a lot of it just depends on the way you handle it you know how you how you handle it after after though the divorce is fine i mean i do you see them it does not make any sense at all 

Recording: (475/ 9621) 
i well you know i i do not see how we can i mean i mean we can refuse to to be certain classes of movies or or i watch certain classes of shows but i you know without getting into that first amendment thing i can not uh you know i do not see how we can have a code of contact oh he is gone to the malls yeah yeah boy i do not know i am i you know i have i have never seen it happen in in my lifetime you know so i i do not know we could be but then of course it can not go on the same way forever you know i can not keep working i do not back 

Recording: (476/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (477/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (478/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (479/ 9621) 
uh essentially dying and so we were dealing with all of this at the same time and it was i mean there was one night i remember we were ready to leave the hospital about seven thirty we checked see there was any messages at home to see if we heard from him uh and got a message that my motherinlaw had fallen them and she was in an emergency the same hospital fortunately so we down there then on the way home the phone calling the south end uh from the hospital that my fatherinlaw had had some bleeding so we had to go back to hospital and then we went around driving around looking for my son this was and this was not unusual it was a horrible period and uh i think what me and i would be angry so he is the only one that really could control his behavior the others could not 

Recording: (480/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (481/ 9621) 
that is not a shocking surprise i mean i rarely get a kid from math although we do have kids that are learning disabled and they do not understand math either even though it is very concrete 

Recording: (482/ 9621) 
duff right 

Recording: (483/ 9621) 
yeah it is a really disciplined school but a lot of rebionate at the same time 

Recording: (484/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (485/ 9621) 
<laugh> sometimes i think that it is just like mass sox and it is like 

Recording: (486/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (487/ 9621) 
exactly huge 

Recording: (488/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (489/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (490/ 9621) 
it is just major thing that you have to do that are a lot more time consuming 

Recording: (491/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (492/ 9621) 
well i should tell them that they should love themselves the girl should that work both of them should love their bodies and not you know give it to a boy that you know found when all over are you in your you you feel all goodness in that you should respect yourself and love your body and you know do not let do not give yourself to somebody just because your you are feeling good uh and the boys i should the boys need to calm down <laugh> um i do not i i mean 

Recording: (493/ 9621) 
she uh has trouble driving even at night and stuff like that 

Recording: (494/ 9621) 
actually yes there are a few people that i know that use it 

Recording: (495/ 9621) 
on the issues but i think it does mean a lot to other people so i can not really answer that question how they would voted it because i did not think that mike coleman exactly had kourismany either 

Recording: (496/ 9621) 
oh i did 

Recording: (497/ 9621) 
we are buying it yeah and we should have paid off in about five years so then we are talking about moving to some place a little simpler to take care of 

Recording: (498/ 9621) 
i do not know i like i think uh i think uh high school in general like that people always talk about raising the standards you know for for high school things but um i think um it is kind of like it is it is really hard to to like i have thought about before just what is wrong with the education caused system in general like i do not know i think it is more of uh more of like uh it is college is a little bit different i guess but it is more of like this whole like the teacher teacher is talking and it like like information goes from like the like the teachers uh mouth to the students to know it is just like oh go without going through eight any of their brains you know it is like just like rome manantness and like you know dates and blah blah blah about you know just like it is it is it is uh it is real structured but it is real hard to think about what that what i to do to change that it is kind of like more like i do not know i mean i had really good like there was a couple really good teachers like my high street teachers and i think this teachers were really good um 

Recording: (499/ 9621) 
blessy where is she from out in the back 

Recording: (500/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (501/ 9621) 
you see 

Recording: (502/ 9621) 
and you do not the problem is as a young says you grow up you do not realize how much your parents did for you until you are probably until you are about thirty five forty do not realize my goodness i am dead you made a sacrifice because now i am learning and i do not know what you did and then by the time you are uh maybe sixty fifty sixty now you got to take care of to carry your parents if you had the morals do it otherwise just ship them off to the far 

Recording: (503/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (504/ 9621) 
the three rs you know i think those are still very important 

Recording: (505/ 9621) 
right and they they were actually able to select a couple from a they talked to a lawyer who range his options and she had a file and they you know threw kind of a bunch of questions in the answers type thing able to limit it in to three couples and they like the first couple they met so 

Recording: (506/ 9621) 
go along with what my father sings and says and if he wants it a certain way why you just do not question that and i just do not do that it is wrong 

Recording: (507/ 9621) 
definitely 

Recording: (508/ 9621) 
yeah because i do not have a degree 

Recording: (509/ 9621) 
you know a lot of it was the the bitterness of the divorce 

Recording: (510/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (511/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (512/ 9621) 
they do not do it today unless a person is a scholar i mean a three point eight road scholar and i hey okay 

Recording: (513/ 9621) 
so it it is been very difficult for us to particularly the last four years in about the time he ran away uh between the time my fatherinlaw died my motherinlaw died which in the five month period so my wife is had an awful lot to deal with um and she is had a lot to deal with in that time 

Recording: (514/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (515/ 9621) 
just 

Recording: (516/ 9621) 
right the hardest both the hardest and easiest thing i think i have ever done was knowing when it was time to take him to the vet to have him use and eyes 

Recording: (517/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (518/ 9621) 
no i would not 

Recording: (519/ 9621) 
getting them someplace stable 

Recording: (520/ 9621) 
i think it is the right position to take um but it like abortion that is one of the the big issues that divide people very quickly uh i i think it is moderating somewhat uh as the gay reds continues continues their campaigns um but that is one where canada has to tread very carefully um i was proud that coleman said it and did it and and did not back down on that um they told me a little bit about his character um i do not know that i can answer you your questions straight forward because i believe in gave i i believe in anybody is rights i know what happens between consent adults in a bedroom is their business not mine 

Recording: (521/ 9621) 
yeah it was like yeah uh it was five weeks early delivering so it was really you know unsplanned as far as when we were expecting it 

Recording: (522/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (523/ 9621) 
i do not know that much about it to be quite honest i did read about it in the paper and i now the whole thing with uh chief jackson and the whole new orleans and they are getting into these up for that and i know this is something new on top of that um and it was a front page of the newspaper they looked at it briefly um i think there must be some truth to it i do not know the extent 

Recording: (524/ 9621) 
well i would say in springfield yeah 

Recording: (525/ 9621) 
right right and i think there is i mean there is so many small communities like even though oh issue i was really obviously it is own it is own little community and then you have got you know double in and they have got got their own individual area that i can not see somebody from double and going over to the less side to to do it you know what i i do not and then maybe also i i feel safer where i live to and and that something that is an issue for me i know when i utah down cleveland now the it makes it does it makes me nervous oh i just can not even think of it um 

Recording: (526/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah 

Recording: (527/ 9621) 
i was forty eight when i retired so it is uh it is great it was terrific 

Recording: (528/ 9621) 
now well it is like you buy it and then you get to do the shopping the fun part you go up and pick out wallpaper and cabinets and all this and that then you have somebody else do that part <laugh> but i do not do like major cutting or anything i just like to get something that needs that that i can have a vision i can usually see this can be really fabulous if you take care of this bathroom and k kitchen and so that is the kind of stuff and i have only done three or four of them but it is fun 

Recording: (529/ 9621) 
um well i think the price has a lot to do with it because i mean that is what i see see over there that prevents it you know they are a sort of from the little line dress that would be like at the limited here or something is you know seventy five pounds you know it like a dollar sixty five or whatever conversion i mean that is a lot you know you see them in limited and you think whatever the price is expensive but you know really if you buy that you are not i am not really going to be buying you know more than one or like anything else for a while and i think i mean here they are is not that sort of like you know he has the most winds or whatever that you know phrases and you know there is that with cd and whatever but i do not know i mean even with the food and everything else i mean it gee people buy so much of it like portions are so big because the restaurants can get it more chilly i mean they are you know the portions are a lot smaller it is more expensive you just eat less and i mean you just see it contributing to everything i mean the o b city problem here and everything else i mean it is getting worse there than it was but i i mean it is nowhere is it anywhere near and that is a large part of the like problem with the people were constantly on me but oh why are americans so fun and like all these things on the television about the americans and i mean that was never ending 

Recording: (530/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (531/ 9621) 
i get a job at at high park so that all i mean it is just amazing because the money is so good you know you really can not beat it i only after work three or four nights a week and it leaves my whole day free for classes and what else um high park girl it is a it is a restaurant it is up in double ain so i do not know i mean i i did that all through high school and college and after i actually after i you wait him from high school i managed to restaurant for about a year and a half 

Recording: (532/ 9621)

Recording: (534/ 9621) 
it has to be a long standing kind of thing yeah you know and that that worries me more than uh i i understand a lot of the objection is because this is just uh uh this is opening the door a crack and the next thing you know i you know one legal step leads to another legal step and then we will have gave marriage and all those things but i do not think that would be a bad thing either oh he is um he is um you know they do not even wanna put it in the air they are gonna put it in the air they are gonna put it in the air they are gonna put it in the air 

Recording: (535/ 9621)

Recording: (586/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (587/ 9621) 
you can not you know um-hum

so that is where he is all apart 

Recording: (593/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (594/ 9621) 
it is and i saw like one of my friends that works so hard to get an mit 

Recording: (595/ 9621) 
oh it is some committee i mean you have to send them in to some place at the state of ohio 

Recording: (596/ 9621)

Recording: (597/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (598/ 9621) 
right and and also the other thing is you you have to be sort of compassionate because like you know you are you are working a lot of airplanes and you are wanting answers like this when you have spent something out you want to a answer you know each air plane is supposed to respond with their calls on like if i tell somebody you know turn left getting three six they are on he is supposed to respond tina bay three ninety six roger well if he does not respond then i would got to say it again which means instead of ten airplanes i know i have eleven i am talking to because i still talk to him two times each so you know there are some people that get really mad quick because they want that answer like that where you know i was a pilot so sometimes i am thinking you know

my parents home stood out there in nineteen uh eleven or twelve certainly after they were married 

Recording: (621/ 9621) 
i walked out and it was not quietly and i <laugh> but it felt good and and i did not even know if i was going to be living in the streets but i will never forget the day you know and his wife worked in the office too so i went to her and i said it was nice working with you i am going home you know he can reach me at home and then he was shocked and he just could not believe in it he said you can not do this he says i will not pay you and i said you know watch me walk out the door and i do not want any money you know so i love out um oh it was just a long drawn out thing i mean they had started out with little things and then it just got bigger like um he had an office off of the main office and it was a pretty prominent uh insurance company and he had his own um agency and he was a successful i mean he is probably still is out there very successful but i was doing some computer training and he was walking me to the other side of the building and he locked the door and turned around he said why do not you get the first or the front door and it was only he and i in the office you know and every once in a while his wife would be in there and i just i lost it i i was mad but i did not want him to think that i was afraid i wanted to be him to be afraid of me so i just i stopped back to my desk and i said oh great i said not only are you paying to work without to be afraid of you and then i think i did scary him because he started you know he backed off a lot and just his personality and his his in and then that that was a real um slap in the face for him home so he was really mean after that so i laughed i just i walked out and picked the kids up at the bus stop off and they are like oh what are you doing i said we are going somewhere you so it is getting the car <laugh> so but um yeah just a couple of experiences like that they will make you do other things so you know i stayed tough and i you know got other jobs and

cancered in that in the paper uh but i have sung in well shah and sing in the symphony of course too i have sung for sixteen years 

Recording: (673/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (674/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (675/ 9621) 
yeah i just his home instruction last year so i may get back into it part of the reason i renewed my certificate was i did some home instruction with the columbus public schools last year and that is kind of like a tutoring job where you can go you can arrange hours with a student that is at home for some reason um i had one that just had a baby <laugh> and um they it is an interesting job because they look for somebody that can cover the most technical i guess subject that the student is taking in my case it turned out to be chemistry in one i think chemistry once in and it it was uh algebra two another time and but they expected us to at least they expected me uh to cover the other subjects two or at least to spend a little bit of time on them so there was english and there was history <laugh> so it really requires you to be well rounded <laugh> and i i like kind of like that uh um i have taught in a couple of other places uh community colleges the college in new york the taught a chemistry class there and uh community college which is in hillsbrough but i taught at their branch and i b utah an an introduction to a collegey class there and an introduction to uh introduction to the arts as it was called <laugh> <laugh> and that was interesting it was uh those are it is kind of an underclass teachers they do not pay you enough to do that they pay you um per student contact hour and in my chemistry class i was teaching a think total of five or six contact hours a week and they were paying something like twenty one or twenty two dollars an hour <laugh> so 

Recording: (676/ 9621) 
but like to some people that is considered a city so i think it is their perspective in that sense 

Recording: (677/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (678/ 9621) 
okay it was kind of uh it was different when i because see because when i went in uh you know i never had any problem b black person or or i do not really care you know as long as they uh did their job and everything on a piece of the same way today uh 

Recording: (679/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (680/ 9621) 
that is not enough i 

Recording: (681/ 9621) 
what they do uh they have like up the four or five months the first four or five months pregnancy they allow to maintain once they start to show they do not let them go to the school anymore just for their uh south of the baby 

Recording: (682/ 9621) 
um-hum plus you guess many different students and well i just walking over here today you know just gas on you know i wonder how many of these people i walk by you know are going to be here in january because you know because i did you know i thought i was this cool man you know 

Recording: (683/ 9621) 
yeah i really do not know i do not understand why they do not because to me it is the most important freedom we have and people um bitch in complain all the time but then when you ask them if they voted they go no it makes no difference well it makes no difference if you do not because your voice was not heard um when i was a political inconsulting for the ohio education association i used to go around and try to get teachers involved in politics um and one of the things i would tell them is that every vote is important and john kennedy won if if if you would take all of the the votes you one by and spread it out across the nation by one vote person per a precinct one vote per prec sink you know they are just been one additional vote either way and any of those precings you know he would have lost uh and so one vote does count and it used to have a list of elections that were decided by one or two votes and when i was with the ohio education association i generally did school levy campaigns and many of them are decided by one two seven eight nineteen nineteen votes um if i knew the magic reason why people do not vote i could sell that and make a make a fortune um but i do not know what it is 

Recording: (684/ 9621) 
yeah yeah because right now you know because he knows how to he is he is learned i would say he knows more of the most kindergartners so i do not even push anything we do not really have a set schedule right now and i am just letting him be creative and you know letting him hope around the house and you know just if i let him watch something it is education on base usually and i let him play on the computer or we will go to different site sometimes to check out things and i am amazed sometimes what he just catches on just from day to day stuff and just listening because he is he listens to everything <laugh> 

Recording: (685/ 9621) 
yeah yeah but i i have purposes tried to work clothes or do the back road it is nice from hill yard you can get almost anywhere whether it be here or or you know where i have been working on back yard so it is not that bad 

Recording: (686/ 9621) 
and he said even when he was in high school they would have they had police officers there so that is not like a new thing but he said you would have people like knives and you would have people with fifth fights you like guns is unheard of you know and i think i do not know where this new trend is coming from i think maybe uh the people feel projected in high school i am sure that you know like i do not i was i did not feel that way but i would like uh in right to a back and i thought you know i am thinking maybe those people oh i felt really felt like horrible and like if every day was like so dramatizing to them i think that would be like for four years every day or just like teased or something like horrible and like no one talks to you i am not justifying what they do at all but i am saying that would make them more that would probably in their mind give them the reason 

Recording: (687/ 9621) 
and he does not seem he does not seem to have any problem it is always been you know whatever she wants i know so far it is worked out pretty well so you know i am sure the situation like that thing is they are gonna come up but we will we will deal with it 

Recording: (688/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (689/ 9621) 
yeah my momin mom are real close 

Recording: (690/ 9621) 
i do i do um part fairs 

Recording: (691/ 9621) 
you know and and it is just i think they do not happen so often and too many people are even involved the whole thing with the oakland when you are talking circle around yourself but you never say anything 

Recording: (692/ 9621) 
yeah and i told them i was going to call up the tv station so they could fill me crawling out the door as an oil issue employee 

Recording: (693/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (694/ 9621) 
i check my tax machine the next day and it says my mother is just trying to accept your offer and i thought i have not done that i have not done this one are we going to do that so i ended up talking to him and i i just planned to him that uh he had caught me off guard in that i would had more time to reconsider it and that because of and it is true because my daughter went to the doctor and the doctor and said that that point like the baby could be here in two weeks and that it was just not going to work for me just a nice man i felt bad and so then i gave him some ideas about how he could sell it 

Recording: (695/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (696/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (697/ 9621) 
well uh one thing you know being uh uh i came from basically a poor neighbor poor poor uh uh lifestyle early life and everything you know so uh uh if anything i guess that kind of made me negative uh of course people that had influence and had money and did not do any thing good with you know on the firm believer that if you get something that you should share it with other other people i do not always practice what up for each but you know that is that would be a good philosophy to live but uh in people of other religious and everything uh you know i learned a lot about religion when i i was raisedededed especially but uh i practice more catholic in anything else now uh but i am generally pretty knowledgeable about judeism than muslims and everything just because they have point interesting 

Recording: (698/ 9621) 
friend who her name was she was not really a french was a teacher when i was in college her name was mrs coose and she got pregnant and she said everybody said she came in one day and said this is the girl it is the girl i found out it is the girl what are you going to name her rosie rosie you have got to be getting she is um i am just putting you on <laugh> oh 

Recording: (699/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (700/ 9621) 
i do not think it is really i do not think it is really affected me and i mean obviously there is my place that goes shopping there is more traffic which i do not particularly care much for um but it i do not think it was ever such a small town where it was like everybody knew each other and it felt like a small community i mean i know in my own neighborhood it is it was where you you went to school with them people at least once i went to high school i went to public school 

Recording: (701/ 9621) 
what department 

Recording: (702/ 9621) 
and anymore you are lucky if you know your neighbors because everybody is so busy doing their own thing but as a world i think that everyone has become closer because of the communication and if you do not really actually speed to the people you are hearing about it on tv or radio or by a telephone or whatever 

Recording: (703/ 9621) 
very very much so now fifty years ago twenty five years ago we would call we would tag that description rather than corporation we would tag in the manner we just define socialism fifty years ago we are a very very socialistic government uh today we are no longer a democratic government as defined back there then huh yeah we are still democratic according to our new definition that is developed over time uh but it is far more socialistic uh but 

Recording: (704/ 9621) 
balps and white 

Recording: (705/ 9621) 
like state heck out of my way here i come my world are welcome to it <laugh>

Recording: (714/ 9621) 
no kids just think oh it can not happen to me i am invincible 

Recording: (715/ 9621) 
hm 

Recording: (716/ 9621) 
unit does it uh and it was not that i had a bad family unit it was just that there was not you know we never talked about it <laugh> sure time we are just talking about that because we were uh she goes we were like you know how did people start talking about sex and relationships and whatnot she goes you know mom and dad hang to me a book i am like they did 

Recording: (717/ 9621) 
we were falling his jeep we kept going longer and we kept going and this other gina and i always put this in the back and i suppose they knew the german pass word but but uh anyway they finally got out we finally got out to where there was a bunch of ruined for them or for rooming for them to fall into our house and building and so on and uh yes i know this is it so uh so we have there was some g i a is <laugh> pretty men around there and so uh we started looking around for a place to land i mean cut our bedrowns out so on and the next morning i do not know i guess i was looking for uh somebody that is had a fire they are warm up some some racing or something anyway one of the first guys i saw was the guys that will work with my wife and uh office they are 

Recording: (718/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (719/ 9621) 
yeah he was lucky so 

Recording: (720/ 9621) 
i think it was a a nice thing about what we had uh we had uh grandparents that were not necessarily they were out of state in some cases we did not see them that much we made a part that uh we communicate with the grandparents regularly and when we did it was a special time we um emphasize the fact that uh uh you know kids want to do certain things okay they saw their mother go out and maybe do some additional things to work for is that uh they aspect we uh asked them that they wanted to go on um a project with the class of what fine but you got to participate in it too we will we will actually what you come up with we made them part of the owner we gave them responsibilities they grew up with the aspect they learned by being around some older people uh which uh i think was good 

Recording: (721/ 9621) 
um yeah 

Recording: (722/ 9621) 
pretty much yeah he could come in to go follow the leader monkey in the middle whatever 

Recording: (723/ 9621) 
i mean i think that is the best way to address it and as far as the home as actual i think there is kids who say well maybe i am okay i do not know if i am care right well hopefully they will know their trueident eventually i mean yeah some people i mean i know men several men who got married had children and then they decided they were okay okay were not they gave him four but they did like one 

Recording: (724/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (725/ 9621)

Recording: (726/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (727/ 9621) 
you know does that all go away about second grade 

Recording: (728/ 9621) 
no it i like i am a business major and i hear the business school here is pretty good so i i wanted to say a look at that my roommate is a business major so he he was going to show me around the they have new buildings i gust so he said he would show me around there uh also i i really do like i came down for a few games and things like that and i like the enthusiasm that people have for this place like inso small there is a select group that has enthusiasm but nothing like here i mean this is ridiculous everyone is just enthusiastic about the university and even there might be he thinks they do not like specifically about the university they do not i am you do not hear him in any like whole like universal negative things about this about the university ever 

Recording: (729/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (730/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (731/ 9621) 
but 

Recording: (732/ 9621) 
and it was just when drug culture was just you know starting we learned about it in school and stuff and now my parents never sent down with me or about smoking i mean i never really smoked but today with teenagers and everything so out in the open you would have to talk to them about things and just say you know i am going to help you and i you know be there for them nine hundred percent obviously the parents where too busy with their own lives to realize what their children were doing so i think they are the ones to be the blame i do 

Recording: (733/ 9621) 
yeah that was pretty bad i think they i do not know what happened 

Recording: (734/ 9621) 
only the only can do it i mean seems like with all the technology in the world they should be able to do something like that the people who have guns in in their home and not have them blyed up or in a you know in a place that no child could find it they are to blame they are they are to blame um that whole thing with the um school out in colorado uh i forget the name of it yeah but when they said that those boys were making those guns in the garage and his parents did not work purely i just find that really hard to believe if a child goes into garage every night and you hear banging and they are buying gun not old and you know i then they were totally um not in tune with what their kids were doing it is one thing them having a side on the internet 

Recording: (735/ 9621) 
i 

Recording: (736/ 9621) 
yeah i have got i have gotten plenty of people <laugh> it is funny too these are not last me so what is your mom going to come and stay with you for a week as now <laugh> i told my mom she started last bbecause i mean of course if we are going to come over and help out as terrific but if she actually stayed at my house for a week i think we just kill each other

um so i just you know it was something that was a little familiar with anyway uh and i was just looking for something he parttime 

Recording: (746/ 9621) 
um i guess that would be a slightly different part of them then not really sure how big a problem that is in public schools but i mean one being the girl that did get pregnant she in of course they will go into public school the next year 

Recording: (747/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (748/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (749/ 9621) 
well no actually my mom did not she was a very bad cook 

Recording: (750/ 9621) 
yeah it or heard ago she thought she was letting you know electing me i said 

Recording: (751/ 9621) 
<laugh> plus i do not really feel like the republican party represents the typist at all they get their last political convention like in uh the last our last selection of ninety six they said one in ten of the circuitsates that were at seven in the convention were a million dollars but granted i know more in ten people and not you know they mean so to me i just feel like you know that is not a good representation 

Recording: (752/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (753/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (754/ 9621) 
yeah so 

Recording: (755/ 9621) 
and because largelyly because of the fear of not knowing and not knowing how to deal with the in the 

Recording: (756/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (757/ 9621) 
i mean during that particular i have been around for a really long time and i i would tip i my views are typically a little bit more democratic but i would not to say that i certainly would not vote um for the person that i thought would do the best job 

Recording: (758/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (759/ 9621) 
um-hum at this point um i am not uh i am not against the urban schools but if that was my own personal child i would not move move to a suburban area until columbus gets their act together they are in so it is such a bad shape right now that i do think the state will take over the columbus public schools in two years yeah they have threatened it uh and if they do not pull their scores up uh they will you know 

Recording: (760/ 9621) 
and i have you know i have got a couple in chicago and and i have a couple in uh the washington area 

Recording: (761/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (762/ 9621) 
once they turn to adulthood and they feel like going out and shooting people or anything like that i do not think that has anything to do with it 

Recording: (763/ 9621) 
the runways uh well i think the youngest that i met was maybe twelve but that is you know still young 

Recording: (764/ 9621) 
well you know it because i have to think of a hot one back into our income with everything else but i am sure i am sure that i did not pay more than three thousand on it and it you know did not t cost me to more than three thousand and so if i had five or six thousand dollars i would i was happy 

Recording: (765/ 9621) 
i do not know that is kind of a tricky question really because on the one hand obviously the kid definitely will get uh made fun of his things like that 

Recording: (766/ 9621) 
well the thing is there is things you can not explain 

Recording: (767/ 9621) 
my sister is last name is good night and when she had her first little girl she said she is going to name her gone and good night but she did not she did not 

Recording: (768/ 9621) 
and 

Recording: (769/ 9621) 
i mean i i had parents that everything i did was negative i mean they just told me i could not do this could not do that and and so what i try to do is when anything comes up i was thinking of how my parents would handle it and i do a hundred and eighty degrees so you know because you know they just i do not know how i got i sort of feel i am mentally okay now but i do not know how i got here because i have been there right you know and it is the you know 

Recording: (770/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (771/ 9621) 
well i think sometimes it is because the child has not ever been taught somehow or other or shown i have always been the kind of person to believe i never told oh my kids not to do something to i myself was doing example smoking cigarettes or taking a drink of beer or taking on wine with my dinner and saying no your not a offer than i can now there are some things that the kids can not do at this age somebody can at another age plus they like go out on the beat for example well he is going on the well he is well he is almost sixteen years old now we call he sixteen years old and i hope you will be allowed to go to parts but by that time i will expect you to be able you know to know what to do uh but i mean i ever did uh and i know <laugh> well i will not give you any samples but anyway if if i told them they could not do it i would try them swearing is one of my bad habits and i know that uh i would try very very hard i got taught one time that i better watch it a little more carefully by my one little girl and but anyway i have always and i would apologize if they did catch me doing something that i would been telling them no you cannot do i would apologize see mommy was fat or mommy did that i guess supble in my mouth one time ago well well well you do not know i mean now if you want to hear the story in funny well give me just to eat it i was digging the pie and i was taking this pour out of the oven it was a cherry pie or an apple pie wanted to get juicy sometimes and i had not put any aluminum foil or in the only third to catch it and just as i started it out i spil it and i said and a bad word you know and just as i said that word leaning down here here is two little shoes <laugh> 

Recording: (772/ 9621) 
yeah i think the terrific for the right things 

Recording: (773/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (774/ 9621) 
fresh 

Recording: (775/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (776/ 9621) 
having for bed but <laugh> i am sitting here going ooh i mean i did not even know what i was doing 

Recording: (777/ 9621)

um-hum 

Recording: (780/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (781/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (782/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (783/ 9621) 
now 

Recording: (784/ 9621) 
and uh well it just fame one out of the 

Recording: (785/ 9621) 
um-hum have a few ideas um i am thinking i might be know be too and 

Recording: (786/ 9621) 
sitting back waiting 

Recording: (787/ 9621) 
and then but the whole band in the cheerleers went to his house and he came out crying i mean it was on tv it was like heart runching 

Recording: (788/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (789/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (790/ 9621) 
but they said all along they were okay they just fought it and they they did not want the pressure from their families 

Recording: (791/ 9621) 
i think so i think so um it is it is uh it is so sad to see a girl you know have so many options closed off now i do not mean it is by any stretch it is a tragic to have a baby but um somebody in high school is is making a lot of decisions she does not intend to make 

Recording: (792/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (793/ 9621) 
because uh again i said you bring up you get wisdom from that as long as you are listening to them uh some people i am sure what their age are they just blow them off ah so that plus you have the i think a understanding of um the schooling they came from um 

Recording: (794/ 9621) 
aconbillar worth so our company is <laugh> 

Recording: (795/ 9621) 
i do have some relatives that are um step my step mom is relatives that are there they are actually members of the more in church 

Recording: (796/ 9621) 
yeah it it is i mean you just know where it goes and you throw it in and there it is yeah um let us see what was my dicotor carter is a lot more difficult than somebody else do it for me 

Recording: (797/ 9621) 
oh good 

Recording: (798/ 9621) 
it ai not that far it is uh 

Recording: (799/ 9621) 
i just can not believe and they said they did not even know what was going on 

Recording: (800/ 9621) 
to build two hundred thousand dollar houses everywhere around me 

Recording: (801/ 9621) 
on different topics 

Recording: (802/ 9621) 
i see it working unfairly 

Recording: (803/ 9621) 
i am i am sure i am sure i am sure i am sure you know welcome is all those dollars but they have like little like a like a like a waiting industry 

Recording: (804/ 9621) 
a famous one <laugh> 

Recording: (805/ 9621) 
i have never heard anybody going on shooting rampaged that were high on top most of them are sitting home and waiting on the pizza 

Recording: (806/ 9621) 
gave me these leading questions and i said uh-huh i know we are coming from i have been coming from with that when i was of high state and so forth and um so i just laid on the line to oh sorry 

Recording: (807/ 9621) 
i got on birth control probably when i was like sixteen or seventeen but still i did not take the pills all the time and you know that was not very good me neither 

Recording: (808/ 9621) 
just like you know like some of these places in florida kind of like ruined by taurus you know like fort lauderdon daytona yeah it is like after after the kids get done <laugh> yeah they just like oh oh yeah we get it the second because uh i used to when i was in and uh like a freshman uh i heard i heard like they even go to florida because they they do not want <laugh> yeah they want your money but they do not like they do not like your they do not like you know the the trash and the and whatnot that they bring 

Recording: (809/ 9621) 
yeah um-hum 

Recording: (810/ 9621) 
depends wonder who the manager is at the time every manager is got a different agenda on what they want you to do 

Recording: (811/ 9621) 
yeah <laugh> 

Recording: (812/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (813/ 9621) 
i know she sort of knows this is what she has to say at school if she is asked on a test because she needs the points for a grade 

Recording: (814/ 9621) 
the one girl had um showed her her her ultra sound and then that is one is like oh is not cute like well wait a minute i might bite you again they are not worth it into the 

Recording: (815/ 9621) 
you know we are right there within a flood or you know something like that you call the guy i will be in thursday you know if you are air conditioning so they are always going to have to have people here so i just deal they are either better to downscale the amount of people they have and get highly qualified people then have twenty people that half of them know what is going on i have them do not so but that is tough to do when you are starting people with eight dollars an hour and stuff so but you know when these mcdonald is or places that you can make that money so um-hum my uh to me the thing that hurts me the most out of it is they want to put cap on our salaries so i am at the highest scale well i can go right now as far as job title there is no other job i can move to until unless i move into supervision or something up in the and i will be out of the union if i do that anyway so but they are going to put a cap on that where you can only make so much money at a point which i am almost there right now i am only like fifty cents away from that cat and if that is the case if i retire in six years i will be kept out right now so in other words i am going to retire in six years if i do not change jobs making exactly what i make now which that was my worst fear of it all but that was not even on the negotiatingating table they were still worried about this too though get this house yeah that is what they were fighting for was the low end did not try to get the hospital on the main campus the same 

Recording: (816/ 9621) 
yeah so it is it is a really tough thing to do i mean you have to be sort of organized and i do not know sort of a maverick i guess because if if you could give a test that would tell who could be an extravagant or who could not you would be a millionaire because the government would buy that from you because intelligence is not a factor i mean there are people who do this job um who i mean are not stupid but they are not college educated and really intelligent but they are extremely good at it and then the other people uh that i know of one that i work with that on a regular basis he is got a master is degree and he is you know he reads continuously he is always up i mean if you ask him anything about like what is going on overseason or anywhere he knows that like the back of his hand but he is one of our weaker ones you know and it is uh 

Recording: (817/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (818/ 9621) 
in the way of benefits 

Recording: (819/ 9621)

oh gosh he does come from saying gas gas i kept saying i do not wanna go this is the first day of school i got lots of time to play guessing games i said spell your your last name said g u e uh so <laugh> to talk about feeling stupid 

Recording: (823/ 9621) 
but to go see it does not like cats are rent they still charge you out but really okay 

Recording: (824/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (825/ 9621) 
because you got trust the people you are around you do not really want to piss them off 

Recording: (826/ 9621) 
um working on three different uh research projects with three different physicians to where um specific to the traumatic brain injury service looking at longterm out comes and people that that has a dangerous brain injuries the other one is a drug study um looking at control of agitation and the other one is a um spinal blood injury research study 

Recording: (827/ 9621) 
exactly 

Recording: (828/ 9621) 
which is great 

Recording: (829/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (830/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (831/ 9621) 
yeah i think i got really good um i would actually have been thinking about it like white departments in the school were good and we went to one to one um the foreign language is really good they have a persian class that is from like second level 

Recording: (832/ 9621) 
again they said the world 

Recording: (833/ 9621) 
anywaying really farming country and he he went out there from iowa where you so you so you are going to be running the corner of the country now and the field and 

Recording: (834/ 9621) 
they are two elderly women that at the church and it this has been about up seven or eight years ago father just mentioned that they had a need uh they it had a church bus and it had broken down so they had a need for to get people to church and i met these two elderly women now the one now it is ninety she turned ninety last october and the other one is about seventy eight now and they live together and i take them to church on sunday okay 

Recording: (835/ 9621) 
it might have been where the president lived they sometimes have like a mission home 

Recording: (836/ 9621) 
for one of the reasons yeah 

Recording: (837/ 9621) 
that and i imagine that is about halfandhalf right now or maybe it is more on this side i do not know so i think that that really is an evolution at this time to tell you the truth basqued of calls of the world and i think what they really mean by by that i hope what they mean by that is that evil and the way it is being run or the way it is being acted out today and it people will not be more compassionate to each other and just be happy and content and i i still think that that has something to do with everybody getting back to really believing there is a god believe in it you should take the other person into consideration it might sound very based speak but it is very though a very hard thing to accomplish especially when they have gotten into this and like you said me me and i got to have this and that status symbol stuff and really if we order people could get out there maybe and start making speecheses somewhere and telling these kids because i know i myself in my own home i i have been a collector now i take this back to the depression years when i did not have anything and my father one time while he was out of work guess what i do not know what well their age and it was but they brought us our christmas dinner and the first all baby i ever had and i remember when i tried to wash the thing off that little doll was one of those that sort of mels in the water and my mother said well if you do not out to take just to help it make it better and better and i believe she did not 

Recording: (838/ 9621) 
hum 

Recording: (839/ 9621)

Recording: (840/ 9621) 
see there i think there has to be a quality to life too and 

Recording: (841/ 9621)

Recording: (855/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (856/ 9621)

Recording: (931/ 9621) 
what i liked so much about it is they tell you everything and then you find out that it is not right and that is right i mean there was the episode 

Recording: (932/ 9621) 
um well maybe not columbus in particular but i do not know i was i think i was just a little no because i was doing the teenagers and i was i had a heavy course load every quarter and i had gone to a summer school here as well just to get more done and so i would he had done seven straight quarters and i am sure that adity and i had a lot of hard classes and you know i was just tired of a high <laugh> 

Recording: (933/ 9621)

so and it was fun and i i made uh we made about nine thousand on it by the time we were done 

Recording: (943/ 9621) 
yeah they are very quantity as opposed to like the quality and then so the analysis is held out bottom line in the numbers because actually that is why i do not like like i like the this and that i enjoy my business classes but some of the people in my business classes i cannot stand because they honestly they are like oh it does not matter how you treat people and then it is all about the bottom line well they will in in my opinion they will end up losing more because it costs a lot to hire an new employee and if you have constant turnover things like that then and if you have a product that because obviously they people are not going to care you know so and they they they seem very close minded like like this is the way business has to be but the just do not seem to be necessarily like that maybe i am coming too far going to one extreme 

Recording: (944/ 9621)

really 

Recording: (949/ 9621) 
and you have been going to the high states that whole time 

Recording: (950/ 9621) 
and people do not seem to understand that uh it is not like you are collecting data for the entire population or the entire universe of the entire universe of working with the sample trying to represent the interior very well sometimes it is good and sometimes it is not 

Recording: (951/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah 

Recording: (952/ 9621) 
um i mean 

Recording: (953/ 9621) 
even in the package of information

Recording: (955/ 9621) 
yeah i uh well and that was really um struggle you know a struggle for money and everything so i would take whatever would come along and when you work in secure jobs like that i mean i had a different job every year i mean a year would come up and i would say okay here we go you know they are either gonna down size or they gonna do something and they always so i was never really shocked and they did not panhandle or anything and i was never without a job and never had to i never missed um you know i would say it would take probably two weeks at the most before i would be working again yeah 

Recording: (956/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (957/ 9621) 
yeah there is a lot of educated people who are not out to just make a bunch of money so it makes for an very intellectual interesting environment but people are trying to live simply there and i kind of agree with that <laugh> <laugh> 

Recording: (958/ 9621) 
just you are you are saying you do not need to have a leader in a family and if i am going to be a leader i am going to be the one i am going to be the one not the spring bag oh you keeping this little two beer oh okay that is the principal of fact no i have to be because there is no father here well

Recording: (964/ 9621) 
and like the social aspect of the problem so 

Recording: (965/ 9621)

Recording: (968/ 9621) 
so they are kind of throw divided out between the projects 

Recording: (969/ 9621) 
that uh that is an interesting question because he was a a serious contender last time and i have not heard his name this time um what people say they would do it they know that they light i came because he is um intelligent charismatic uh all those those neat things that you need to to be elected today um and a lot of people said they you would vote for him but what they say in poll they do not know if it would translate over but yeah i think he could i think the right candidate could and i think mike calledman this year in the columbus ratio but that i mean he crossed ponder lines he crossed uh party lines he crossed over into all of the city and winning even door the teachers precinked which surprised me you know and and not by just a little small margin i think it was two hundred and some votes which is pretty substantial 

Recording: (970/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (971/ 9621)

Recording: (972/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (973/ 9621) 
and they think those little bunch of people they just do not want to spend any extra money on anything so we are already paying for enough of things you know i do that 

Recording: (974/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (975/ 9621)

right 

Recording: (985/ 9621) 
uh how do you picture it 

Recording: (986/ 9621) 
i do not i think what they were protesting was that they were being involved in it was not that part of their protest 

Recording: (987/ 9621) 
oh yeah they are getting even better though they really are they are much better now than they were twenty years ago because trend is to keep these students in the mainstream as much as possible so teures are having to learn to for example 

Recording: (988/ 9621) 
and yeah i yeah i should not have done that so now let us just go get some more furniture <laugh>

Recording: (991/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (992/ 9621)

um-hum yeah 

Recording: (995/ 9621) 
they do not have any like uh major they do not like on it in major space used list where you get like 

Recording: (996/ 9621)

Recording: (997/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (998/ 9621) 
yeah yeah i i do not know but it then they second guess the mother and she raised her life and i they they can not do that i mean you know it is too bad that you know she was not there to to go on with what they were planning on doing but it is not our right to to take other country is kids even i mean that is another thing i mean come to america we will take everyone in every you know but then we have all these this crime because we have all these terrorist people that come from i mean that is all they have grown up with is the tear activities and the mentality and all that they come here and if they can not make it then they will just bomb somewhere and then <laugh> but i see a lot of that too yeah a lot of the crime is a lot of foreign things that you know you i you would kind of want to do a study of how long they have been here and you know it would be interesting oh i think there is got to be a line drawn and i think that uh you know if they are if they are caught uh in in any kind of crime or anything they and i know they send them back but um i just think that we are just too open with that and there is got to be a line to say this is as many people as as we care to you know yeah i mean i know that is hard but and and it is hard to draw the line but then other countries if it is so miserable there then they need to work on their country because 

Recording: (999/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1000/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1001/ 9621) 
i think what then they just need to get their heads out of the ground and you know look all over the place for different plays you look on the screen it is different you say why would it done this this and this and this but you know down on the field they have to think that they are going to be doing this you know 

Recording: (1002/ 9621)

um-hum 

Recording: (1006/ 9621) 
guns should definitely be kept in the lock box where kids can not get them besides that there is not a whole lot that government can do it is more of the parents responsibility to keep the guns out of their kids hands 

Recording: (1007/ 9621) 
you know that is his real father so i got to sit there and keep my mouth shut 

Recording: (1008/ 9621)

Recording: (1009/ 9621) 
something like that i i do not real much about it 

Recording: (1010/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (1011/ 9621) 
so i ended up doing that for about three months and ended up plunking out of uh ou in the in the first three months the first quarter so uh than i got my notice in january so 

Recording: (1012/ 9621) 
i mean there people think cars will not run 

Recording: (1013/ 9621) 
yeah could not get me to pay the rent <laugh> that is yeah <laugh> 

Recording: (1014/ 9621)

Recording: (1015/ 9621) 
and then i got my master is in seventy five so it took me four years that way no i never i just was smart enough to do it before i had kids 

Recording: (1016/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1017/ 9621) 
and apparently that is the way of conditioning in conversation uh one of the guys that i usually go clubbing with he is the one that got me into the little stick dancing and he said uh said there is this like a sign that says come it on me and i am like oh great that that is that is what i need and that does not bother me that does not bother me i just i just i sort of i am just like now you know i am if they start if they start getting really you know really pushy about it i am just like i am straight but a lot of times it is probably funny because i will get in a conversation with them and they will be like you are straight are not you i am like yeah they do not yeah they i do not know how but they must be it is just being i guess it must be the way i talk or or or something but i think i keep a lot of them away because i do do a lot of really i do a lot of really real bus movements with my goodness they come like playing about and you know it is like this you know i have this wide birth around me yeah it it is not one of these it is one of these and you know it is yeah um-hum hum yeah 

Recording: (1018/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1019/ 9621) 
oh not very right now and i twenty twenty years the first twenty years i worked at the bureau i was working statistics so i learned a lot about numbers and how to use them and what you can do with them how easily they are misinter puted and my wife uh has been the director of institutional research at the university uh data research uh they do not really have other kinds of research there uh 

Recording: (1020/ 9621) 
you know or a conversation piece you know or some kind of trophy well here is my here is my dog my labrador and he uh full and uh a lot of these people were uh the dogs were reacting in uh uh they were objective you know and and they were because they were not being paid attention to and they were pissing on the carpet and making messes and chunting things up and and these people would bring them in and uh uh have them put to sleep 

Recording: (1021/ 9621) 
<laugh> so that is why she is trying to get it out of the way now because you know the the the he makes you know fairly decent money so you know she does not have to work right now but in order for them to move up the way they want to move up you know after the baby comes she will need to work son when he was in high school had a girl no a little girl friend and she was a see he was tenth grade and she was i need to great i guess she uh believe me and so it was in the eleventh grade when that baby was born and uh she had a lot of problems running away from home and uh she i you know well my son left to move into the dorm here at oh issue and she uh moves in with me i think the baby was fifteen months old and i trade to help the young lady and it just turned out that the you know the young lady was not ready to be a mother my son would not even now is not ready to be a father so uh there was a you know whole investigation through children is service buses and uh they gave me custody of the child temporarily and she is still there she is four and a half the mother is married and has another child now and then the little one is still with me 

Recording: (1022/ 9621) 
well now they do not 

Recording: (1023/ 9621) 
not as an individual uh well see that is a problem i am it is hard to find a balance betweenika and you know free of information in as long as people i mean some people like this information uh jerry springer is still running oh which i i actually kind of enjoy watching them once in a while they get it is it is kind of interesting to watch these people uh bed i mean and where do you draw the line what people should see in the see i do not know i do not want somebody telling me i could see something or tell me about my kids going see uh that is my job if i do not want my kids to see something on tv we will have an argument but it used to be easy but never let all of that you know it huh uh denneth is twenty one year old and an eighteen year old is not as easy 

Recording: (1024/ 9621) 
for like summer projects or something 

Recording: (1025/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1026/ 9621) 
yeah <laugh> 

Recording: (1027/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1028/ 9621) 
if they want to get married that is their business i do not think it is mine or anyone else to say that they can not 

Recording: (1029/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (1030/ 9621) 
i think more along the lines of like physical abuse things like that uh would be probably crossing the line uh like if he got they are legislatures uh excuse me if he was allegedlyly beating his wife or something like that obviously then then that will cause a problem with them i i can not say that i would vote for anyone like that but i mean just like small things like that where it does not really threit in the nation or anything and i mean it is something that happened 

Recording: (1031/ 9621) 
and i have one at north and high school she is a sophomore there and they wanted to use a freshman and uh i married and uh what else i live in uh northeast climas by seventy one and one sixty one and that is about it 

Recording: (1032/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1033/ 9621) 
exactly 

Recording: (1034/ 9621) 
getting married having kids you know and then uh i am not supposed to live 

Recording: (1035/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (1036/ 9621)

Recording: (1038/ 9621) 
donate so much to spend okay well that you remember back sometime they were ninety percent tax brackets and so forth so that means ninety cents on that dollar he gave yeah 

Recording: (1039/ 9621) 
people graduate get degrees from a high state working here taking one course at one course a quarter and get a degree in history or whatever it might take them two ten years or something you know but it is like why not it is free 

Recording: (1040/ 9621)

where i live now i have lived there for eleven years 

Recording: (1042/ 9621)

and that maybe you would i crash one of the the waiting <laugh> 

Recording: (1044/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah 

Recording: (1045/ 9621) 
but i have been in situations where people of cold races jokes and sometimes i let it pass because you do have to pick the time to to challenge someone very carefully but in other situations i have said i do not find those types of jokes funny please do not tell them any more in my presence do what you want one you are with your other friend but do not do it in front of me i do not even like blonde jokes i find those sexist and racist in a way and i do not i no one will tell them to me one day when i was still working in an office they were telling me fifteen or i just kept a stone face that one or two i did <laugh> smile they were trying to get me to laugh when i would not but uh 

Recording: (1046/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1047/ 9621) 
okay wow dear dear how do you get back to the original without being part of the original 

Recording: (1048/ 9621) 
i think a lot of people do not understand a lot of people do not it is a mind set uh uh they do not wanna deal with numbers of other people or they want something in simple and that is what they are looking for they do not really want to know what it means uh and it is statistic under any to run uh any definitionally is nothing more than an average of some kind 

Recording: (1049/ 9621) 
yeah it was like freshman and stuff for the year 

Recording: (1050/ 9621) 
well all puttoing everything and saying this is dumb and stuff as as far as bringing it too together like socially i think that is just a rough age 

Recording: (1051/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1052/ 9621) 
i can argue up the size of that i am in a luxury i guess where we are in a position where i actually do not have to work so if i ever felt that he was in jeopardy or he was not getting what he wanted or needed i would quit and be to to to take care of that but having family was him the first eer and a half um i do not know i got all my schooling everything out of the way i cut down to the sixty percent when he was born to have more time with him uh i do not know it is a whole different society with e meals and uh uh computer in the internet and the south phones i mean it is in some regards it is much more connected but some are not personal and uh oh i think uh i do not know moms being outside the home i think so many families are forced to do that with the cost and as it the costares at the once and it is another very material society right now but it is also a very um good economical time too bog market overall has been up i know it is down right now but overall so the money is been flying and houses and buildings and 

Recording: (1053/ 9621) 
yeah i would i would say you know life application things would definitely need to be part of it i do not think that you should throw out english sure math or you know i can not believe i am saying this history but <laugh> i do not think you should throw out that stuff but i do not think that there should be as much emphasis on it i think more of the emphasis should be on life skills and just being able to make it on your own take and take care of yourself and but definitely i think that there is other 

Recording: (1054/ 9621) 
you know i mean it was just like and then it also put a mark on you to go somewhere else so you would never want to you know ever say anything but um yeah that 

Recording: (1055/ 9621) 
oh yeah well i do not know <laugh> 

Recording: (1056/ 9621)

um if you are going to do something like that you better at least know the risks involved into it and what exactly you are doing before you do anything like that 

Recording: (1079/ 9621) 
because they always dress up and everything when they go to the bars so 

Recording: (1080/ 9621) 
so we have a lot of time together and she says she thinks that was worth it 

Recording: (1081/ 9621)

<laugh> you know we my husband and i were just talking about this i was saying i am not in for the you know george overal nineteen eighty four and big brother syndrome at all um my ideal situation would be that somebody decides who should have kids and whoops not but i do not think god is going to come down and do that so you know what i mean we can not really decide that but to be honest i i am for it um it does not have to be well i am not even sure tube schider is pretty permanent um but then if they could do something like on a yearly basis and give them two hundred dollars a year that is still much cheaper than them having kids um and then if they i give more money they clean up their act just for them um as far as it being races i do not think i think they are missing the the point because i am sure there is some run of white teenage girls out there too or mexican or white night um 

Recording: (1093/ 9621) 
i have got them sounds like i bought a dog 

Recording: (1094/ 9621)

Recording: (1096/ 9621) 
i was reading a thing though and uh just i think was yesterday where uh you are uh minority and you are you are uh majority you know uh that is always been uh you know they were trying to make it seem like it is different it is always like like the army have always made forty percent uh minority in sixty percent or something today you know the air force has always been uh like seventy thirty or something like that you know because of standards it is a lot bit hard to get in and a lot of people do not want to get into the if they want to take them test and everything you know uh my uh a cousin that was a uh spent twenty five years i think in new army because that is they could have done better but that is all they want to do you know beautiful sargent and stuff like that you know but uh i i still think a lot a lot of times immediate 

Recording: (1097/ 9621) 
you know so it is you know if you if you have a problem if you wanna talk to somebody well if if somebody you know personally does not they know somebody 

Recording: (1098/ 9621) 
you know not that what you wear makes you but he is just he is a good role model 

Recording: (1099/ 9621) 
exactly 

Recording: (1100/ 9621) 
well i thought about that you know i mean doing something in the anywhere uh even as a vet assistant but um with domestic animals um 

Recording: (1101/ 9621)

Recording: (1104/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1105/ 9621) 
yeah i guess i am just so secure about who i am than i do not have a problem with it and i was in the men is league club for a while so there is a small percentage of the people in there that are uh that are good as well and that is and and i have really made friends with a lot of them i guess i mean i guess it is just because of my personality i i i really do not know what it is but apparently something in my personality calls out to them and says come hey you can be my friend i am cool i am all right even though i am not even though i am not one of you i can still be a friend which is sort of what i try and imitate because i am on very very religious and the christian community is very is i am not going to say can be i say they are christian community is very very mean towards homosexuals and that is just not right i mean they are they are making a mistake in in my eyes yes but that does not mean i am going to look at them any differently as human beings they deserve my respect oh yeah but i see everyone is engaged in central behavior because in my in my religion everyone is and so um i am a i am a christian i go to nondonominational church um i do not like the nomination i am not 

Recording: (1106/ 9621) 
a lot easier market yourself 

Recording: (1107/ 9621)

Recording: (1108/ 9621) 
yeah he he and three other people well a lot of them had signed the union they have to have almost everybody signed for it but um he was one of the people he fired him but not for that because you can not do that the legal so he but he sent a form letter with everybody it was exactly the same to the three people that were fired except for their names or for the these like basically made up reasons 

Recording: (1109/ 9621) 
yeah i have two other sisters <laugh> um one of them is well it is funny because we are all divorced uh the five of us were all on one of them is on her third marriage and we are all on in our second except for one she is divorced or she has it be married and then my oldest i told him back and i guess he is not been married 

Recording: (1110/ 9621)

Recording: (1111/ 9621) 
she is the type of person i love doing away 

Recording: (1112/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1113/ 9621) 
but she is young and everybody is prejudice against her and i have got to sit there and shut my mouth and do her work 

Recording: (1114/ 9621) 
no that is not what i mean no i do not i do not mean it that way but i just mean i think i think it is better that if people are are get to a point where they can not work it out i mean i think that but a lot of times you can do things like counseling and those types of things and and maybe there is some way to work it out 

Recording: (1115/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (1116/ 9621) 
you would be sleeping on the beach before you even shell out that kind of bugs 

Recording: (1117/ 9621) 
i do not understand that 

Recording: (1118/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1119/ 9621) 
uh essentially all the big enough to make as much the us on it is actually all over the world it is international 

Recording: (1120/ 9621) 
uh when she she was they were their pregnancy but she did not i am just going to public school 

Recording: (1121/ 9621) 
oh yeah um-hum it is the biggest thing 

Recording: (1122/ 9621) 
i seen the uh big amnator and what is that that what is that the opera house yeah right right on the right on the ways that does you know whatever it is gorgeous 

Recording: (1123/ 9621) 
i would say it is not any different than having a man i mean it is a person she just has a different way of going about it probably 

Recording: (1124/ 9621) 
yeah and uh i hadprerogative i could have gone somewhere else and made more money you know but the bad part was that the university is trying to do away with the civil service is the good thing and the bad thing you know you do you had step raises and everything so at least you did have an increase back then nowadays you have now something 

Recording: (1125/ 9621) 
yeah <laugh> that is it 

Recording: (1126/ 9621) 
well i was uh i was pretty well astabilus to about responsibility and that is the rather thing before i went into service as over the son in a family of ten 

Recording: (1127/ 9621) 
uh was not going into too much detail uh one of my best friends from high school well he stayed at home and i went off to come on this and i found an amazing church down here and learned a lot and and really dambled across a lot of interesting doctor in in a he feels actually strongly that anyone who believes of ours is like a heritage and he just went off to alaska with another friend of ours and before he left for alaska i actually took the time to to uh i did not want to but he was just sort of pushing me into it because we were i am in each other and uh he sort of pushing me into it a little bit and i told him you know i am like a lot of the stuff that you have talked about uh you know talked about not like i believe and i and i told him i said i can i can understand if in our minds there is a problem but we accept the fact that the other person is wrong at leaving at that but that is not what you are thinking you are thinking you are looking at me and you are knowing within your mind he is evil he is wrong and i said that is not right did yeah that i do not think so they are certain i mean like they are certain denomination they will take one it is sort of like the other limits they will take one book or one script out of the bible and it expand it to crystal clareity and they will just run with it and that is what my mom came out of um her her denomination that she came out of she is not part of it any more denomination she came out of it uh some of the more devout churches within the apist idea christian church we are talking mentioned on one side women sit on the other women wear little finney is on their heads no jewelry the serve of is read in three different languages it is really whacky stuff 

Recording: (1128/ 9621) 
you know the only thing that really really saved my son i think from getting into any kind of trouble or anything was he was so involved in sports 

Recording: (1129/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (1130/ 9621) 
no nobody has a daughter and that was from high school um his girlfriend uh got pregnant and then he stayed with her and they tried to work things out and they never got married and and that was when he lived in canada so she lives in canada now and he goes you know he talks to her all the time and then they are real open about that i mean she is real good about letting the little girl come and she will stay at somewhere with us and and she will drive up there and see her too 

Recording: (1131/ 9621) 
i got told you i can be an idiot 

Recording: (1132/ 9621) 
so you you pretty much have to be you know it can not be middle class and you know it have got to be you have to be rich or you are not 

Recording: (1133/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1134/ 9621) 
no no she uh 

Recording: (1135/ 9621) 
no he did not he did not 

Recording: (1136/ 9621) 
unless you get stuck in traffic 

Recording: (1137/ 9621) 
no she is oh she is really playing smart i mean <laugh> 

Recording: (1138/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah uh you know up there uh now i had saying it was cool public school districts you probably districts you probably would get the same this year but by being kirkwood you know would or small one or something uh i think we maybe had uh a hundred some kids in our graduating class you know so uh i felt i get better attention when i wanted it you know uh then i would have at a at a bigger school 

Recording: (1139/ 9621) 
yeah i mean getting a gun does it i mean i was surprised like i i will i am never owned a gun but i am i think it is pretty easy to get one actually 

Recording: (1140/ 9621) 
i think it is really you really have to be careful who you put on the medication and how much you put them on and how long they stay on it and and most kids do not like being on medication because it makes them different they do not look at it like gee i am really lucky i live in a day in time when there is appeal to help me centrating they look at it like well my my friend is had to do it and they say well i know i have not have not you know <laugh> they look at it like it is a big pain because they got to run over to the nurse and get their pill the lunch and generally the long acting the time released ones there is only a couple of them a couple of the different medication that are out in the time released and and they only work for about forty percent of the population most people try the time released and it wears off and it does not do what it is supposed to do so they go back to the six hour oh said you know one in the morning one at lunch and then their friends all know that they have to go get their pill and then they are like to the lunch line and you know they just hate it so oh but it is not something they can a lot of kids will not i guess they are in d now just like we would be and they say that does not help me i do not need it but when you sit down and say okay what other things are able to do when you are on it that you really have to couple with when you are off of it and they see it in black and white they go oh yeah 

Recording: (1141/ 9621) 
i think so yeah like their hair cuts are a certain way and can not you have to shave and um you always have to have your tie and your jacket if you can hm it is really hot there is it is different also depending on the climate 

Recording: (1142/ 9621) 
in his room uh so that is the most powerful thing i can do when i can turn it over to god and say god this too damn big for me to handle do you think you can working maybe helping changes person is heart or their mind because i can not do that um so you know that did not mean you know what i meant sit there 

Recording: (1143/ 9621) 
when i did school levy campaigns uh and a couple of other campaigns to me the biggest thing is is what the the campaign does on election day called get out the vote that is the most important thing that can be done um i used to always at the beginning of a a campaign for a school level get a list of all the mastered voters and of course i had a very limited population in a school district and i would have the school district compare it to parents and the first thing i do is register parent because many of them do not vote uh and i read a study somewhere that the average person in this country does not even begin to vote until they are forty if i had known that when i was in college and works so hard to get the vote changed eighteen because i could not vote till i was twenty one and i was upset you know because i wanted to vote for certain candidates because of the vietnam war that was a big issue and i could not uh i had a wait till i was twenty one so there was a bunch of us at college that you know worked and did some volunteer worked to get that whole thing changed if they knew that they were not going to vote at eighteen and we were going to wait till they were almost forty i would not i would not have wasted my time um but anyway um you get parents who are usually younger especially of the the first second third grade 

Recording: (1144/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1145/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1146/ 9621) 
and then it is different businesses like white castle or pizza one of the pizza places and uh some of the super markets and things and they are advertised you know throughout the community so these kids when they have problems they might want to go to uncle berry house and they do not have a way and so they go to a safe house and they call and they have a you know group of volunteers that go out and pick these kids up take them to hunkydary house which is not for from here so i did that for a while but uh was not very uh satisfying because i really did not feel like they were doing anything to really help the kids and hook them very well 

Recording: (1147/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1148/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1149/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1150/ 9621) 
well i am saying on the whole world and they are and everybody is so busy now with all the things that they have to do even me i think maybe he sounds the same way but maybe you are not <laugh> so i have i thought when i retired i would just get this done and this done and this done and i wonder now how i went to work and still got something to eat done so i got home and i am sure from doing it just as fast because over and over again people say i have never seen any of but it was as much energy your always doing something but and i think it is just that we do not have the time 

Recording: (1151/ 9621) 
oh sure 

Recording: (1152/ 9621) 
right so they do not come see men i guess they should not care because i i would just like them actually if i would like them just come for about payments so they can see them at this wonderful home we have that is like everybody is was showed off 

Recording: (1153/ 9621) 
yeah it is a lot smaller than columbus though 

Recording: (1154/ 9621) 
and i think it was an article this last wednesday into the spatch in business section as to how the pc still can not regulate it and because that they want to dereate telecommunications uh and so for the past month we have not been getting tillmobiles for us each we had a back one we are paying for and what is going to happen on this whole thing is he offers us a a a lot of that to with with uh week and now uh if we have a contractor let us say over in dayton and we are calling from gainesville office i would rather make them long distance we can go on our pipe and if we have a line going on dayton we can make that cause if it is a local call of boating all on distance 

Recording: (1155/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1156/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1157/ 9621) 
do you have one now 

Recording: (1158/ 9621) 
kind of balance the brother out a little bit <laugh> 

Recording: (1159/ 9621) 
um i do not really think there is any huge difference uh i can not say from what i have seen the people that went cathy schools uh they are a little bit more disciplined and they know how to like organize their time better and things like that like i mean most of my friends have gone to the public schools are really overwhelmed by the medicine that they have to do here 

Recording: (1160/ 9621) 
yeah i mean i guess so i mean i always spend the weekends with my dad and i spend the week with him 

Recording: (1161/ 9621) 
uh because there is not like uh like i could find lead lead person because it is just one person doing it most of the most of the time i mean like people do have groups that play like texan el beat or more in and music but it is not like a beat singer who like you know it is like that it is not like that at all 

Recording: (1162/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1163/ 9621) 
it is extremely difficult to deal with 

Recording: (1164/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1165/ 9621) 
oh yeah we have probably been five six times now and 

Recording: (1166/ 9621) 
talk to them like you know this would be nice down um 

Recording: (1167/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1168/ 9621) 
um not really i mean i have been with a few people that have just i mean just randomly gotten kind of jumped at me they they just beat him up for no reason or what not 

Recording: (1169/ 9621) 
yeah it was cutting twenty pounds in three days 

Recording: (1170/ 9621) 
white women who had actually had it done than uh than um hispanic or african american but i do not know at least in that case i mean before we were talking about the government i mean at least in that case there still is a choice i mean there is money in involge but it is it is not so much money that it would erratically change your life in that sort of you know you know it is not thousands of dollars it it was two hundred i believe and and that is that is you know i mean if is that amount of money is going to sway you in that direction i do not know i think you know there is the debate about ten years down the line but you know is there going to be something that is going to make some change you know what is it you know what is it going to be and like how how realistic is it for you know what percentage i mean i do not know anything about the sort of statistics of people who do clean up their act or anything like that but i mean i do think there is that element of choice it is a lot different than you know the government saying okay this is your cut off one minute but i mean the statistics they were getting giving on um the average number of children children at these one we are having and you know the average number of children that were just taken to the hospital unless there or you know just dropped off wherever and and the states that these children were in and their life span and everything else i mean you know there is the human rights for the mother but what about the you know the same is in england you have one say oh because they were talking about you know i mean again this was just an idea they were kicking around but sort of you know somehow sort of forcing the young girls to at least be in birth control you know in whatever way and and again that everyone was up in arms but it is so sort of like you know what is about child is quality life can to be when their mother is just you know 

Recording: (1171/ 9621) 
it took us ten years to have them you know i think my mom generally thought i was doing birth control and we were not but you always knew the set of asr tone under mean you know is she here is not she wants this like one i am not going to discuss it with her because i knew that that was an ono to her but i was not but you need to know that 

Recording: (1172/ 9621) 
and too much prejudice there really is still and it is that but it there really is 

Recording: (1173/ 9621) 
because now they are getting to the age where they are fighting more and you know and you have got a boy and a girl and you know it is 

Recording: (1174/ 9621) 
i know 

Recording: (1175/ 9621) 
in what they would say about americans and american culture like at that discussion group you know in front of you you either so 

Recording: (1176/ 9621) 
one thing okay go ahead well one thing uh i was thinking you know that i have a perspective on that maybe like lots of people do not is how columbus is grown up 

Recording: (1177/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1178/ 9621) 
so and i figure i have a hundred up to a hundred and fifty four credits and so i am i am up to like ninety four right now and i figure that would be a decent i mean it translatesates over because we are in the past hours it will get on that stuff there but it it is it is like i am halfway to three fourths down with uh with my degrees so if if i wanted to transfer now it would be like because it after this point if i stay any longer then a lot of the credit card will not transfer be a waste of time because most places do not like to take more than half so that is why i just see it right now i should look 

Recording: (1179/ 9621) 
i mean just like beauty and the beast there is an extreme amount of violence in there uh you know just everyone there is a a bad or to the and then including my own daughter she and i swear i had her watch mister runders all the time but now that she is older she watches tv she is of course to be tv something terrible in the so of course our children are uh so but i think you know i was i did not have have givey when i was a child child and i think you know it it stimates the imagination in some yes but i do not know what direction that imagination really goes you know in but there is a tremendous amount of violence in front of everybody is face any as a matter of fact i am getting so i do not watch the news 

Recording: (1180/ 9621) 
henderson oh and tandy 

Recording: (1181/ 9621)

Recording: (1187/ 9621) 
well i i think we oh yeah we are we are church gore is but just to be going church of course is not uh is not being faithful i think it is just uh sharing yourself uh with one another and daily lives uh listening to someone out reaching to someone where it might be that is uh the mystery that uh i think our our our lord is giveness 

Recording: (1188/ 9621)

Recording: (1222/ 9621) 
i think there spends a lot of mistakes made by everyone on that and i really think and even though i would hope there was a better way to handle i think they did the right thing by taking them away from the uh the cousins i mean the the cousins have been stressing all over you need the family he needs something well there is a much closer family than your father and that that they love this country and this stuff well then accept the laws and follow them whether you even agree with them or not uh i i i it was very unfortunate at the way it happened and but i think the government should not allow the go on as long as they had 

Recording: (1223/ 9621)

Recording: (1235/ 9621) 
no because i think there is the ideal in everything and if you can not live up to that ideal standard but you do the best you can you do and i think that is where i was coming from i mean even now uh i mean i could never agree with abortion let us say i i would stand by the church and and most most of the church laws i do stand by but i guess the birth control as she became so personnel and uh it was just a decision that had to be made and i had to make it with a what i thought was a clear conscience and what i did i do not have even regrets for it what about you 

Recording: (1236/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1237/ 9621) 
well yeah i just give you the rough estimate of uh two and a half miles from here

Recording: (1239/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1240/ 9621) 
hey crime is not is an interesting term uh all crimes all murders are hate related i uh i am not sure it that is it it is difficult i we had civil rights laws many people were opposed to those but it was uh in an effort to correct years of institutionalized races uh and and maybe something like that is needed to stop years of institutionalized hate but a crime is a crime are you know are you going to give someone who murdered matthew shepherd six life terms as opposed to someone who murders someone else one life term i mean murder is murder and there is already a a law in the book so i do not think we need to have a hate crime over and above that you know it the the people who murdered matthew shepherd should be tried and hope convicteded on the facts and should not have anything else added into it i i think doing that is going to do the same thing that the many of the civil rights and uh uh a firmity action programs and the bussing did that people is going to turn people against uh guys like they turn people against blacks for a while though all ultimately i think it did make a difference i i had a i have a black friend at the ohio education association who was very active in the sixties in uh opening up restaurants in the south than marching and you know going to you know opening the schools in the south and i said for one day are you disappointed that things are not better uh you know that people still hate black this is ten fifteen years ago and she said no she said that was not my goal my goal was not to change hearts and minds my goal was to change behavior and to they have changed except now i never thought i would live to see an all white jury convict white then of uh killing a black man we are in hearts and minds now

Recording: (1255/ 9621)

Recording: (1256/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1257/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1258/ 9621) 
<laugh> uh-huh 

Recording: (1259/ 9621) 
yeah i was i was driving by the the hunking and everything so yeah my roommate is not going to uh let the bait about it but it we did not really resolve it 

Recording: (1260/ 9621) 
and even if you had two full blood from two different crimes and they had child the federal government still considered some half blood 

Recording: (1261/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1262/ 9621) 
um actually i was over there when all of that happened but of course it was all over the papers and you know i think i mean i i do not know what it was like really here i can imagine but i mean they are especially they really focused on um not collin byne but the one with the the younger kids in arkansas was it d before i was there from both of those but you know in the first one you know they they put the picture of the little kid in combat gear holding the gun everywhere and columbine you know every paper had a slightly different slant on the story and you know their facts were all over the place but that is another kind of issue but uh what i think caused it i mean i do not know i think that like more should have been made of the fact of you know this like terrible sort of resentment for the other students and and you know i am not in any way defending the guys who did it but uh you know something is wrong not only with them but in the fact that they were like driven to that point and where they felt so hated and so maligned or whatever that you know that you would even think of doing something like that um i do not know especially with you know everything that was said about the families and you know they did not seem to of course you never really know but they did not seem to have grown up in this you know to terable environment and you know have that sort of you know preconditioned or anything like that um yeah i think a lot some more effort needs to be made you know to sort of you know playate those sort of situations and i mean who does it is sort of another a question because you know the teachers already are overworked and underpaid and you know all those kind of things but i do not know 

Recording: (1263/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (1264/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (1265/ 9621) 
eighty so we just uh we just sat around our love and twenty university yeah 

Recording: (1266/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (1267/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1268/ 9621) 
yeah i think they are really helpful and i think that it is the only way that a single mom or anybody raising kids can make it there is really but there is so much fraud and there is so many people that take it advantage of it that it hurts the other people that really need it you know like with me i did not want to stay on that i wanted to be on my own and i was perfectly capable of it but if i did not have the ambition that that i had that i might have stayed home there is like nine you know there was even a mother that lived across from me in my apartment complex that i would get up and go to work every day and she would have food delivered to the her front step and she drove that year is car i mean she had a brand new you know like whatever year it was that is the car she had and i i would just jake my head and wonder how she ever got away with it and you know at that 

Recording: (1269/ 9621) 
yeah oh yeah you know people i was in kindergarten with i graduated with so it is kind of like the small town thing which uh has goods and but uh yeah my parents still live there and i still associate with a lot of friends i graduated with that still live in town and you know they just had a twenty year reunion here a couple years ago and a lot of participation in that and so 

Recording: (1270/ 9621) 
you can not take that away from it so but you know like you said i think they just go through a lot of stuff i mean i had a lot of uh and i must be towards my dad is poor things that happen you know uh prattisney being there when i was you know was younger and stuff like that and uh if anymore my brother got close to the johns of you know because he is three years older than me um then uh but but you know now you know i do not know they they are both out but my parents have passed away but uh you know i do not have any any in the most of towards them at all you know i kind of like it is kind of like a drawing up thing i i get just you know i mean you you kind of sit there and say eight you know you did the best you could you know i mean 

Recording: (1271/ 9621) 
is it often so similar to where i am coming from 

Recording: (1272/ 9621) 
that is a very strong animal and as the old man that got lifted twenty five feet in the air against the pine tree found out and my opinion when that stuff happens when i she well i see someone light the horns of a bul on fire and spaying interment the bowl and then all of a sudden the bowl gets the flame put out and the bowl runs gord through the person is leg and throws them around and kills them right near death i do not have any sympathy for them 

Recording: (1273/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1274/ 9621) 
he would be lost 

Recording: (1275/ 9621) 
we can get to the beach and take them there we have family in florida we have family in hawaii we have family in virginia beach so 

Recording: (1276/ 9621) 
because i went to oregon and of course uh the greater part of the population out there are more or socialist than they are capitalist and they are easier to deal with than they are more reasonable people in my opinion much more reasonable but then i come back to columbus and all my family in and in all i am the minority in my family believe me and uh they are very into capitalism and their lives are working pretty good for them so 

Recording: (1277/ 9621) 
do not i mean make 

Recording: (1278/ 9621) 
and then a couple years later he was working on a job in a plumber coated fabric plant which is that makes oh coda fabric they make uh the main thing is uh auto up on the street car up on the street anyway they had big rolling machines that roll this stuff out and those fumes came off but so they had a big hood and exhaust system 

Recording: (1279/ 9621) 
i do not know i i do not know if it was drugs or <laugh> something ridiculous and they they done a lot of people and i think a lot of the the police force our son a lot of other officials are are pretty much in agreement that he should be dine and he feels like like he is just not going to and that we do not have any um the the the mayor can not nobody can actually make him resigned that that is something he has to do on his own and that was one of the big things as far as you know to work it was peter was saying i am going to make him do this which is something that she does not have any any power to deal um and and about how how they just continue to get raised and they are and they are not doing very much about it in and less than fifty percent of the police force just actually in police kind and and a lot of people are are doing dust jobs and this types of things and i i guess a lot of people just are not very happy with the job he is been doing 

Recording: (1280/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1281/ 9621) 
well in in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in in the in in the in in the in in the in in in the in in in theumbyous part of it you know just saying trying to be protective of the ways 

Recording: (1282/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1283/ 9621)

Recording: (1286/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (1287/ 9621)

Recording: (1292/ 9621) 
i have never heard it said before like you said that that the reason women are not precious because they do not show any kind of uh spiritual leadership uh i i have never heard that said and there must be people who think that 

Recording: (1293/ 9621) 
but that is my plan 

Recording: (1294/ 9621) 
but they just do not have those 

Recording: (1295/ 9621) 
you know historic building and i am like there is no history in america you know 

Recording: (1296/ 9621) 
red because i do not know why that was but it sounds like it i guess and yeah i was caught a lot of little things 

Recording: (1297/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (1298/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (1299/ 9621) 
um yeah like i knew uh like a lot of people who who live down on hudson like over the summer before i went to us and um so i mean i like campus and everything it is just like of course she is different than campus you know 

Recording: (1300/ 9621) 
but if you love they do love someone you want them to do what you right and you want them to learn and if that is the punishment they have to pay for something they did wrong you still love them but you are loving other people also in other words you are not letting the fact this is my child so he can get away with murder but this is not over here i am not going to let get away with it no i am sorry if my child committed something that this other one i am sorry you have done that dearly but and i love you dearly but i tried to teach you different i do not know where you went wrong i do not want to just wrong it every but you got to pay the penalty i mean you have to draw the line somewhere but now you sit family yes i think the reason that it already if we look back everyone was born and everyone was uh by a father mothering late one they were little and how their former dearers are and the education the um the way they were uh pott as they were growing up does help them be become what that president is what that any politician is any minister or anybody else the way you are raised i firmly believe in the things you were taught does have an impact on what you do the rest of your life and i know a lot of the things that i have done in my life are definitely based on what i saw happen back here you know and i think that it it it bears on everybody so that is why it really justs with the family 

Recording: (1301/ 9621) 
yeah i mean it is just sort of like the whole reputation of you know america just being like the country of access like access positions access food access food access food access aid access money you know everything you know and it is it is you know i sort of have mixed feelings about it the first time when i was gone for about a year and a half and i came back back you know this is i had done like a lot of traveling over there and everything and really loved the whole atmosphere especially of mainland europe and everything and i come back and you know where my parents live they were all these you know new strip malls built and stuff and i just felt like i was in you know just like giant kmartland you know i mean it just was so overwhelming even though obviously i would grown up with you know i come my whole life and you know not that i sort of can not i know to completely but you do when you have been away from it and to come back and you know to go into these like cavernous places and like just the other day my friend took me to east and then i mean you walk in there and i do not i do not feel like i mean columbus you know i feel like uh it is got to be california or something just because it just 

Recording: (1302/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1303/ 9621) 
no and she said you know in in the the last three or four years she just wrote it out so she could retire and she is being very dedicated uh i already dedicate teacher and she just it was a job then and it is hazy that happened to good teachers 

Recording: (1304/ 9621) 
if you do not make a child support payment they should do the same thing i do not know why they do not have a system like that

i agree with it yeah 

Recording: (1311/ 9621) 
oh is that right 

Recording: (1312/ 9621) 
but most of the time like i try and uh like most of the time it is pretty easy i guess pretty straight forward sometimes it is really aggravating when 

Recording: (1313/ 9621) 
uh it is not true i mean uh some of the older men in older tribes in different tribes um 

Recording: (1314/ 9621)

Recording: (1320/ 9621)

Recording: (1321/ 9621) 
oh yeah and and i i probably step on your toes here but i i am not a firm believer if mom and dad both working i my wife works until we had children then she stayed home and once they got in in to school she worked at a school so when they were gone she was gone when they were home she was at home and you know my parents did not do that and i hated it i hated coming home from school by myself or reading okay there was nobody there to talk to you know and i did it for years and and i just feel that you know i i hope you do not have children yet do you good because to me parents who put kids in day care and uh you know after school programs are like people who have cats and dogs i get up in the morning and i i feed my pet my child then i put him in the kennel and i go to work and i go gee i need to go for some drinks after work and go to the movie we will just put her in another kennel after work can not we take her from one kennel to the other kennel we will be back a little bit and then i go and i have all my fun and i go pick her up at the kennel and i bring her home and i dust her off 

Recording: (1322/ 9621) 
so be it you know we had the ribard is out there helping out the the gi is fine t manford was not it but then after g guys came home so they went back to the house and business all these idealized say hey we can do something here because those days well they said well i will go to this little odd job we want those things mom would do a pick up little extra things here and so forth they have the primary bread winter but she would gotten this odd jobs just to hus their needs for that budget they bought things on a cash basis as they needed it they did not go out and spend on credit uh many of them some of them have myself here but and they said hey let us produce these lines little uh you want a refrigerator room we can make it for you know we can make it cheap for you because we can mass produce it 

Recording: (1323/ 9621)

Recording: (1371/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1372/ 9621) 
i mean i am sure nineteen i was seeing some really bizarre things too uh but you can tell that he is the thought about it 

Recording: (1373/ 9621) 
all right number one none of them had a the privileges of having a car where they could drive and go anywhere they wanted when they got out of school and they got a job and they bought the car and they had a car they were not allowed to have them i fine taking it running over to this kid is house or that kid is 

Recording: (1374/ 9621) 
the way he first started out i liked him he had on sensible things that would almost what we are talking about now i think sometimes but he and we are to keep up with uh uh i can not remember all the name of the shows that do not watch them but i am doing oh freeze one of them and all these other people it is just like her and of course they get into the smut and everything else and what they have done on all that malare gee and i think he decided he had to do the same thing on his program more for him to keep his ratings up so you know and and see that is what you mean by getting into what this person does over here and that is another thing we need to beterkids because john dog cameo is doing it does not mean that is right have the courage to be yourself and say no some people i think are terrible sometimes but 

Recording: (1375/ 9621) 
and they they say that is the city and my school or where i grew up was more than double that just over double that it was like sixty thousand 

Recording: (1376/ 9621) 
you know any schools that have a thousand people i just can not imagine i mean you know my my high school was like four hundred people and we thought that was big at the time and just to have a south people and just to try to monitor different things i mean it is got to be so hard you know in checking everything and 

Recording: (1377/ 9621) 
yeah i live in uh seeverville oh from um far from new orleans oh yeah i got i think they are a hundred and seven yeah this year for just from my class oh 

Recording: (1378/ 9621) 
and they used to have the laser light show downtown they they do not have anymore uh you know just even if you do one thing for your mind 

Recording: (1379/ 9621) 
you can do anything for fifty dollars a week you know you work two two hours a day you know for a week and and fifty dollars for two kids is really not that much a week so 

Recording: (1380/ 9621) 
well i think the people that made that law should uh also too not be able to keep their jobs from more than two years and see how they like it 

Recording: (1381/ 9621) 
and i had to you know uh in other ones it is it is a struggle with that thing and understanding it takes time to understand it lot of people a lot of good people are helping me to try and understand it uh i was trying all that the fear of that uh though i am not afraid any to die i am afraid sometimes and all die before i get a chance to do what i feel i was in there to do which is just the basic things fall with some money have children raise them 

Recording: (1382/ 9621) 
uh me too years ago <laugh> 

Recording: (1383/ 9621) 
and they but now my daughter is my daughter has twin sons who just are a year out of college and uh i think that they are one they one of them particularly is i think in good moral good sort of guy and that one i do not feel like i know as well but i i really think that they are both good and uh yeah 

Recording: (1384/ 9621) 
well i work i work part time kind of because uh i worked full time when he was you know one and i did not uh i felt like uh um the baby sitters or you know whoever saw him more than i did and that because i do not allow my son more than anything in the world and i felt like he needed me you know so i went down a part time i am struggling more but i would rather see my son have me you know 

Recording: (1385/ 9621) 
um-hum i moved just just moving to uh up over one sixty one cleveland area uh i would lived up there for a year so they just moved back up there and uh why is left it was because of the the city the traffic and everything where you get around campus you know it is a lot and they sell us business but down here even with with the kids and everything going to school but basically have kind of laid back uh more up there so go go go uh 

Recording: (1386/ 9621) 
well it is harder than i think in in some ways than people think uh i went to the teach ohio fair last year to look around and did not see that much interest in in uh chemistry or general science teachers um i think the market is it is fluctuated back to a point where they do not need as many right now you know in claiming for us <laugh> um-hum 

Recording: (1387/ 9621) 
is it really 

Recording: (1388/ 9621) 
i think people are still fairly racist i do not think it is near as bad as it was but at the same time i mean i can not say a blank i am the white community so much for it i would say it is probably both the white and i guess any other race relations uh um i mean as far as like if you look at the black community things like that you have like b e t uh you have like united neitherer college fund things like that where they are almost aggravating themselves by having these organizations because they are geared specifically towards black people and i think in a way that is almost tigerating themselves from the rest of the community because they are not given out equal opportunity to people that need them um it is sort of like the same thing white people are doing you know thirty forty years ago where that they had their white organizations or whatnot um and i think it is sort of going along the same lines where there is still the problem of it but i think it has gotten better at least if nothing else 

Recording: (1389/ 9621) 
for that nice noise and uh some in smern uh which is outside at atlanta but girls that i met through school and stuff 

Recording: (1390/ 9621) 
but yet that leaves the door open for who to get in trouble 

Recording: (1391/ 9621) 
i mean i am sure there is some but it is not as extreme as some places that i have been 

Recording: (1392/ 9621)

Recording: (1395/ 9621) 
oh i am sure 

Recording: (1396/ 9621) 
it is not that the property taxes are that much higher anyway it is that um the homes are worth more because of the school system 

Recording: (1397/ 9621)

typical dorm room 

Recording: (1439/ 9621) 
um that is probably when they started yeah um 

Recording: (1440/ 9621) 
yeah um yeah i it is hard because i i do come a i am a christian so i believe that homosexuality is wrong but i do not like i said i am not going to condem them uh at all like i said i have friends it i understand what you are saying um but i think that something more for the parents or the teacher to pick out than maybe that child um is having a problem and then sending them to counseling of some sort and not actually incorporated it in a thirty student on some people um it would be nice if we had more of an open environment schools and the teachers really had the time to notice that maybe somebody had a problem in the talk to them about it and then sent them on that counseling one way um just because if you are going to teach it to a a large amount of students i am not even sure if that one student would listen because all the rest of them would probably be making cracks and just make them feel war do you know what i mean so i do not 

Recording: (1441/ 9621) 
that is pretty cool 

Recording: (1442/ 9621) 
el goor really does not entice me at all he claims he invented the internet 

Recording: (1443/ 9621) 
um i sort of agree with the fact that if someone wants a gun they will get a gun it does not matter what they do to try to make it so people can not get their hand and so guns they are basically always going to be around and people are always going to get them if they want them 

Recording: (1444/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1445/ 9621) 
no not really um all my good friends from well i would say like out of all my good friends from high school one of them you know two of them are still here

Recording: (1447/ 9621) 
uh my stepmother is 

Recording: (1448/ 9621) 
yeah you know that is that is the thing so i think just being aware and then also like i said with with all the i mean and i am and i am still opined in this too and anybody that knows me i look at all the advertising i look at the advertising and i look through i i see ladhers and i see colds and i see fear is you look through and you say oh okay you know you are looking for things to buy well then you got a two whole two pages of women and braves and they are looking at the camera they are in the camera and you are like okay how many how many different braves do women really need that is not for the women i am sorry you know most women by the time they are buying brought know what choices they have you know they do not need all that but then it is funny because then i keep flipping through and i look at the men is heads are usually cut off they are not wearing any kind of revealing under wear at all i mean it is just so uneven so we leave these these guys or these poor boys that are growing up we be push all of a sudden you know and then expect them to deal with it you know and they see tv shows and and everything else that you know it is okay to be with five women but boy that women is with more than one man and she is you know i mean i think it is what we teach our kids and that goes back to the government in society and and what we are allowed to to show our kids you know you get involved in the free speech and that is fine but wait till those kids grow up and and wait till those people that were pushing the free speech get smog or you know anything else happens to them 

Recording: (1449/ 9621)

Recording: (1460/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (1461/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (1462/ 9621) 
so that is you know they a lot of my decisions were based upon that 

Recording: (1463/ 9621) 
um but you know i think what they did was fairly good they did not really as far as i remember at that point at least they did not well they must have done gone into this sort of moral issue uh but i what i remember was more of a scientific approach 

Recording: (1464/ 9621) 
for ae is for uh not getting hurt <laugh> she works at fed ex and uh her crew is always getting hurt mainly huh 

Recording: (1465/ 9621) 
first to second quarter 

Recording: (1466/ 9621) 
no no but hopefully when they do get to one strike somebody i say somebody because i right now i do not really think we have that in place but we would need more of uh um wind strike stepping stone you know and i let us face it counseling is probably not gonna work uh and somebody in that they would almost take um i do personally know people that go into that type of i am talking about right i am at here in columbus and actually work with the families and work with the kids and actually are in their living there showing i mean um you know it is it is one thing to go help them and then leave that and go home to your nice house i do not unfortunately i admit it i could not do it but um if if people really did things like that i think there would be hope for them because they are actually friends or actually people that have been in that environment and come out those type of people i think might be able to reach them i will not be able to reach them probably just because one of one i know about it um i am yeah i agree i do not think it would be a deterrent at all initially but if we had more things in in place and somebody actually realized the background and trying to get them out of that hopefully even if you save has of them it is better than than anything yeah

i think my daughter jennifer is very active uh not so much uh the type of work that i do but i think she is very cheroable very begetting very uh 

Recording: (1480/ 9621) 
well i do think access is too easy but it is sort of like anything else i think if laws were passed the people who are against it would be so you know just besides themselves but it would i do not know for how long but i think it would make the situation not with the shootings and things like that but i think it would make the just the gun situation probably much worse for a while because people would be you know doing illegal things to get guns and that sort of thing but i mean too many people have guns here there is too much of a in my opinion you know there is too much of a gun culture i mean over there they have pretty much you know out light guns except for hunting and things and the fact that you know of course they are so employee around but the fact that you can pretty much successfully do that obviously the england such a small country in comparison but i mean that is just amazing to me and but it is true i mean the fact that you know that access is just there is almost nothing but it and i mean just the amount of people that i just hear sort of yeah in conversation talking about oh yeah uh you know getting a gun for security and all this stuff it is like you know your chances of number one needing it and number two if you were in that just minute percentage of you know happen chance that you would need it the fact that if you used it it just shootsutes someone who was not you know i mean everything is against you 

Recording: (1481/ 9621) 
well i do not know it does not make sense

Recording: (1484/ 9621)

Recording: (1486/ 9621) 
i do not know i would like to think i would like to say no sitting here but you never know because i guess that is that is what happens to a lot of them they they come out of school all i dealistic and then they go into industry and then they are molded and assuming they make upper management there is you want the tax breaks you want the thing you know what i mean and then they like i have an uncle he is a vice president on the wall street from maryland she said you know he he got out of school he is very idealistic but now he he he is like all those people they should you know i i made it through myself and he is not for like the you know but realistically he did not but

Recording: (1495/ 9621) 
when i first you know got it to worse so it is been hard 

Recording: (1496/ 9621) 
that once you have built through it through something it looks different but previous to it yeah there is a lot there there is way too much shared experience to to gloss over effectively so when she said look if you have never listened to anything else that i say you will listen to this you need to go to europe i would like okay i will go to europe 

Recording: (1497/ 9621) 
goes i had a conversation with her but and said you know you did not cause anything you know me and your mother are trying to close at all if anything you were the price above the whole murder so that is where you got to look at yourself from you see that reflecting in the mirror number that you know

Recording: (1504/ 9621) 
no because uh all the kids take that california achievement test on if you are familiar with that and it is like you know because it is seems like you and i go to school you go to you have got a double and and i go to the worst school and columbus and we both make straight a is well when you take the california achievement test that really that a is means nothing because it is like let us see what you understand and have learned the score on that is what really matters to me and both my daughters have really scored extremely high on those because you know they always pick on columbus public schools they go oh it is a what kind of other test scores well you know if you take say like uh the worst school in town which i do not know what it would be but let us just say it is uh brown school well you have someone there who have not seen dad in probably ten years and mom is basically sometimes there or in prison so the live with grandma want them to do well nobody is there to you know i am not a uh you know i an over or anything but you know i always keep tabs on my kids you know like i have always gone to conference even though they got straight a he is i go to conference with him teachers go well what do you come for and i go if i do not come then it is like saying you know i do not really care so i always go so they know that i am keeping tabs on things and i do not demand a is i just demand them to do their best and i said you know if your best is the see then that is one it will be but i said if your best is an a to get going to see you get me to talk to you so um back to the brown school uh there are kids like my daughter there who make straight a is and when they take the um what is that thing the efficiency test b from through it and get like outstanding on it and uh then you have this probably sounds really biased or big at a budget then you have the kid who is mom and dad are not together and and he comes to school maybe twice a week and when he takes a profession test he gets like a 

Recording: (1505/ 9621) 
like i had my kids last week i had them all right how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and then i had them one by one come up to the table in the front they did not know i was going to do this so after they got all and i go out and i get my little bag of stuff and i bring in my bread my peanut butter and my jelly and i sit them down beside me and i go okay now no ad living no adding no taking away read exactly inly what you wrote

i mean my my kids went to a school that uh when my son was already left to but in the fourth grade they then they took all the kids in the other direction and said we are closing next year and it was hard but you know once it is reached the point that decision is made and announced and and there were good reasons for it uh and they explain the reasons and you know at some point you have you have to figure out how much do you want to fight something when it is going to have a bordable 

Recording: (1511/ 9621) 
the most neatest the old 

Recording: (1512/ 9621) 
every kid in my kid ran around with i knew these parents one way or another 

Recording: (1513/ 9621) 
you do not have too many options you know 

Recording: (1514/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1515/ 9621) 
because the larger story was two hours to film in one one movie but this one as a as a part of a hole i i am deserving and complete judgement until 

Recording: (1516/ 9621) 
oh okay 

Recording: (1517/ 9621) 
as uh a lot of mothers do but she was they are and if they needed her for anything or neither is that say no to something <laugh> as you would say are and uh you know i think that uh that probably adds something to do with and in fact that our kids knew what our moral beliefs or 

Recording: (1518/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1519/ 9621) 
she is already i did not mean she is having it in the other way

yeah it is like um i do not know they used to have something called the sporting post that was directly related and then um advanturing kind of took over for that like in still in boy scouts and then explain went off on its own and as a result they took religion out of the program and they put they a lot oh lake home of sexality with uh liters and all that so it is i do not know we call it like hippie voiceouts 

Recording: (1525/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1526/ 9621) 
and we pick out of those because otherwise your kids going to hate you 

Recording: (1527/ 9621) 
we had uh counter battery fire we called it which when they were shooting back at us once in north africa was kind of scary uh we were in positions where we could fire on a a uh tank bit bogar is going on we had a four four word observer up there where he could look down and see the whole thing and so he was adjusting fire and i do not know how many tank they claim to be head but 

Recording: (1528/ 9621)

course my wife is worked in higher education for thirty years so 

Recording: (1615/ 9621) 
she could not understand the fact that you could just disagree with her it had to be because she was black or she was an older woman or you can just disagree had to be a reason there especially she she used to me that in front of my boss who was black who did not believe it he knew better so

Recording: (1639/ 9621) 
i do not like bought things so i just do not um i think it is it is kind of like you get what you pay for 

Recording: (1640/ 9621)

oh you have so it is like i mean i it is like i heard about that that is not even worth going to be food 

Recording: (1653/ 9621) 
well i think at that age the parents should be involved and hopefully they will be open the mind enough to know that this is going to be something she is going to have the rest of her life um i will tell you what with today is world and some of these fourteen year olds that look like they are twenty and you know they they know what they are doing and know they should not keep repeating that um i just think the most important thing is just for them to be able to have the option i really do but yes the parents should be involved i would say to the age seventeen they you know i think they should have a parents consent hopefully the parents will love their daughter enough to realize when it mistakes it is going to be she is going to be a young mother and then eventually maybe not even want to be a mother you know i mean there is a lot of girls that have those babies and then they just they kill them you know and there is so much of that for a while they were that was going on and it was like he i can not believe these women are doing this you know they just snap <laugh> 

Recording: (1654/ 9621) 
but i i had a noin before i had the heart attack i had already had two heart attacks i had a noin that i needed to be on the first shift or i would probably have another heart attack and they would not i put me on first shift then i had another heart attack put me to the hospital then i had another heart attack while i was in the hospital and when i came out that is when i gave him another no state i need it really beyond for a shift 

Recording: (1655/ 9621)

Recording: (1857/ 9621) 
but since all the moms have gone to work and let the tv become the electronic babysitter and the other thing that is happening is kids do not know things now all that you would expect them to know like because their moms are not reading to them like they do not know who any of the who is

everybody gets something 

Recording: (1860/ 9621) 
were for me

yeah and they are also talking about because uh uh the actors the reason they are ending it is in fact the actors do not want to do it there was talk i do not know if they are still pursuing this that they would have new characters take over the role and i mean the character developments the most important part i think uh so i think that will be a failure but that also sort of tells me that they are getting these things kind of open 

Recording: (1862/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1863/ 9621) 
oh okay okay uh yeah as far as the siblings go bernie is uh does terrible work

Recording: (1937/ 9621) 
and the real meaning behind it so 

Recording: (1938/ 9621) 
it is not that bad because a lot of times it is just busy for a while and then it is like not busy at later at night um so then i can just talk because we sit right next to each other so it is okay it is good that is right 

Recording: (1939/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1940/ 9621)

Recording: (1942/ 9621) 
and this is my consent so what you use that <laugh> yeah 

Recording: (1943/ 9621) 
she is she is adorable how old is she in this picture 

Recording: (1944/ 9621)

Recording: (1945/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (1946/ 9621) 
um-hum

i have to get a job and supporting myself so 

Recording: (1955/ 9621) 
five years 

Recording: (1956/ 9621) 
so it brings that down and it is like you know they are they are not comparing it fairly if you would take all the people who are making the same score on the tests at both schools i will betcha they are all about about the same 

Recording: (1957/ 9621) 
yeah it is it 

Recording: (1958/ 9621)

Recording: (1959/ 9621) 
predomately i like i like playing uh i like puzzles i like challengeers i do not like jigs of puzzles uh i like anything that involved it i do not mind breaking things either because then you have something to think of course it made me a very bad logical job 

Recording: (1960/ 9621) 
well he was not really recognized then until just the last couple of years and part of the problem was it was fairly new and everybody was being dupon state of the hd and it was not really there were really good screening the instruments for now they are now uh and we have often felt that he needed to have gifted emphasis for gifted children is uh and the uh schools would not do that for me because his grades were not good enough because he did not do the work 

Recording: (1961/ 9621)

um i think i think that there should be a mandatory because you have it in big companies you have mandatory uh sexual harassment tape and in in you learn you teach the girls that it is not what they do it is how they make you feel as as instituted as your uh uh harassment there and they are too afraid and then besides that they you know there is crashes on you know you can not fault the girls for having crashes and things like that they are going through enough things as it is

Recording: (2006/ 9621) 
oh that is nice 

Recording: (2007/ 9621) 
oh yeah yeah 

Recording: (2008/ 9621) 
yes it is definitely having effect on uh children and uh uh the schools are trying to catch up or make up for it but they are not doing it yet whether they they will be able to pick up enough uh by changing the way they teach and so on in the next twenty years i do not know but uh i am glad my my children went to school when they did <laugh> and i stayed home with them 

Recording: (2009/ 9621)

Recording: (2012/ 9621) 
yeah there is like people calling and talk about other like they saw it in this other our mail order catalog that i have never heard of either it is i do not know how really they do it like it is just like they get people is names and stuff from credit card companies and then mail them out things and if people call back or whatever 

Recording: (2013/ 9621) 
somewhat 

Recording: (2014/ 9621) 
like you know 

Recording: (2015/ 9621) 
yeah it it wrong right 

Recording: (2016/ 9621)

Recording: (2017/ 9621) 
when his background really was 

Recording: (2018/ 9621) 
yeah graduate math of high school uh and road in the oh year for uh the one or quarter and pursue a party that uh and at the time 

Recording: (2019/ 9621) 
yeah it was very hard for me to stay in school i could not easily quit like that because the teachers did not i went to a college public school and it they did not care i mean i i went through elementary and middle school with short a is and b is and got there and all was on seats to be is you know and it just was really the teachers did not care you know if you learn you learn if you do not you do not if you do not come to school you do not they do not care that was how my school was so i do not um there was i do not there was nothing there that really i can remember that did anything good for me i mean i think middle school taught me a lot more or the nice school 

Recording: (2020/ 9621) 
they are not as many of them or you mean because 

Recording: (2021/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (2022/ 9621) 
and she is taking very good care of herself she is following all the doctors uh orders and she is very careful what she eats and 

Recording: (2023/ 9621) 
um um 

Recording: (2024/ 9621) 
uh i live up north uh around carolina and uh more so road 

Recording: (2025/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2026/ 9621) 
but it is not going to work i mean they if you are around people i mean number one they are around their parents and their siblings and that social is any station you go to church or to the library or wherever i mean you are around people and you are around children and they get to have socialization if you wanna call it whatever and i think from everything that i have read and seen that um they get the socialization that they need at home and they are not relying so much on their peers and their poor is opinions because i i for one example and the pokey man craze my son did not know what pokey man was until he heard some other kids talking about it and you know it is just like stuff like that it is just like they do not they do not know what half of that stuff is unless some other kid is pushing it in their face you know and then even still they are just like oh it is cool because everybody else likes it they do not really know what it is or what it is about or i mean do you know what i mean because it is like they they just blow up each other or whatever it is like really what is the point to the whole thing and he did not know what it was until he heard some other kids talking about oh you must be cold because some other kids are talking about it but then he decided that it was not cold so that was my influence our influence on him rather than the peers ines on him 

Recording: (2027/ 9621) 
great brother in christian middle school in some part of worthinton schools because they act it 

Recording: (2028/ 9621)

Recording: (2029/ 9621) 
yeah that seems good 

Recording: (2030/ 9621)

Recording: (2031/ 9621) 
oh i do not know you know 

Recording: (2032/ 9621) 
he seems confused parenting with controlling 

Recording: (2033/ 9621) 
so i am lucky to get too much of an attitude from people 

Recording: (2034/ 9621) 
i think it is important to know what the person is values and customers are and to support whatever it is and if i mean we have done some wild things over there but i mean it is i mean we have changed room around beds around how beds needed to be placed in order they needed uh they is the north star or they needed to have this thing above the better under the bed and i mean if it is important for them to have prayer then i think it is important to get the appropriate people over and encourage them to have whatever it is they need 

Recording: (2035/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (2036/ 9621) 
and i do not really think it is something that needs to be taught um the only thing probably is like where they call that uh culturally diversity or whatever classes they have is take i think but that i do not think is such a bad idea uh because just because you grew up in i do not know what i grew up in but i will i will give you an example i did not grew up in let us say somebody that goes hunting and fishing and drives tracks and wears ball caps and listens country music does not mean if somebody does not do that they are not okay i think that would be a good idea or you know cultures are different so if you wanted to view that as a culture or do you know what they mean that that is something to a friend um except the people you know how to like what they are doing but they are still people so 

Recording: (2037/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2038/ 9621) 
<laugh>

Recording: (2059/ 9621) 
i that certainly possible there are lots of ways that my friend does it work <laugh> in ways that other people do so i think i think a lot of it too has to to do with been comfortable with yourself and knowing you know i mean i have gotten so much better over the years i was very i have always been real a lot more temporary we always joke you though that that predictableible and some of those things are not uh even temperate or not things you would use to describe me you know but but not in a negative negative way you know i just think that as i have got know or two i have been able to see things and not be so get so concerned about things that that really were not that important anymore 

Recording: (2060/ 9621) 
sixteen years old uh

yeah we are getting in patient and we are getting um it it is sort of like you know the pendulum will swing back the other way eventually maybe thirty years from now although the old be kids will be you know in this country will be learning more than they ever have but right now i think we are we are really not doing justice to the curriculum and i say my friends i say teach these kids well because they are going to be running the country be in our own age we will be sitting a rocking chair and they will be running the country so you have better teach them well when you look at it like that 

Recording: (2081/ 9621)

um-hum 

Recording: (2103/ 9621) 
we we do not necessarily over come bed by bed we are still very much in that from work of restaurants than this on this particular <laugh>

Recording: (2114/ 9621) 
you know and that was and that worked out well but i think too like with my school schedule you know if i am just in class maybe you know three four days a week eat and then the rest of the time in the evening jay is not over there so it is not like i am relying on her every single day all the time to do that and i really would not want to put my child in day care 

Recording: (2115/ 9621) 
and they seem like random or just spontaneous and there is no way it was nothing you can do in life to really avoid it except hide hide and basement or something in that for yeah 

Recording: (2116/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (2117/ 9621)

Recording: (2122/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2123/ 9621) 
and and it am going to hold you to this confidently because very few people know about this 

Recording: (2124/ 9621) 
you know whatever is going on they always have to have a back up plan though and then i know well if this happens this will work and if this does not happen this way then this is all we will do instead

Recording: (2182/ 9621) 
yeah well there was not even an opportunity for him to try and think of ways to say and just there was nothing there there was no ability to communicate there was a he needs some of this piece of information at the same time there is no way i could tell it to him so yeah <laugh> it is like oh so i am yeah you do not know and there is nothing else to do about it and continue on maryland he i he said eventually he said it was sometime later and i actually found it always going on he said i had some suspicions because you can do a quick party count for the figure out who is not there and it seems something bad it happened but um but he said but it was a while before i found out actually so we can stop them we can stop the story here or we can go like because the story it is a fun story but

all the politicians i take the governor or take the president of the united states they can want something this way but then they have got the senate and all these other committees down below them that it they overruly what good does he you know what can he do really i mean no matter what he promised and you are voting him in there for what he is promising you but if he can not backso forth and getting these other guys to back him up oh there they went <laugh> 

Recording: (2283/ 9621) 
period and it is that is a long process i mean this has been going on for two hundred years this way uh and people are suspicious of government asking questions 

Recording: (2284/ 9621) 
i do not know i i would not personally like think that the parents should be held responsible i mean they do have you know a certain amount of responsibility just because they should have been more aware and and especially because i mean i believe that those at least one of the two had been in counseling and had to you know was doing it a grussian management or something like that um you know you would think that if they were going through something like that you would just sort of you know maybe keep the closer eye on what they were doing so i think you know to that degree you know the parents should have um you know we are sort of responsible and also with like their kids disposition i mean you know would you not notice some differences on they like that was going to happen i mean depending on uh you know how well they hit it or whatever but um i think at that point though you are you are so influenced by air peers 

Recording: (2285/ 9621) 
so i became a problem business major 

Recording: (2286/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2287/ 9621) 
casting off authority and that kind of stuff it was about someone making a bad choice uh you know gaining power because of it and then ultimately seeing the in the foley of the ways and dying in the classic uh tragic hero sort of way um and so i am looking forward to how they build up to that points um a lot of people in high school they do not what the hell are you talking about though but uh um yeah i am looking forward to see how things to come about

now i got them 

Recording: (2451/ 9621) 
think about things i mean it is pretty easy to do 

Recording: (2452/ 9621) 
well i agree that we should help them maybe through some sort of government program but i think what really hurts them the most is the people that actually give them the money on in high street because it really does not motivate them to get out of the gutter i mean if they can make a living off of bagging change off of college students they are probably going to stay with that because it is really easy life 

Recording: (2453/ 9621) 
yeah four or five years it is not that bad uh how old oh that is very young yeah you do not want another one yet <laugh> you know at least you know diapers out of the way before you go to the next one 

Recording: (2454/ 9621) 
i think the point is they are on drugs you know and i do not yeah i am not i do not consider myself raises at all it is unfortunate that that is what is happening but it is just one of those things like you hate to say yeah i am for it because you sound like it is like everything is specific and permanent yeah i kind of have a problem with that um because they might change their mind but then again they can always adopt you know and i kind of look at it that way there is enough kids out there need love and 

Recording: (2455/ 9621) 
gosh you know that is one of the things that i really you know when i read the paper i think wow what can you do it has to start there first you know and i think if um and i in this might be because i am a woman but i think if women started running things it would be a lot different than when men run things because men tend to think you know like the government and that kind of thing those kind of uh funds that are available for different organizations they they are all geared toward things that essentially help them as a whole or help um well yeah but i mean not so much that um it is always been the women is bonsthely to be responsible for the kids or to care about their well being and a peaceful environment and all that kind of thing men are more that is go get it and you know we you need more money and you know they 

Recording: (2456/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (2457/ 9621) 
i am sure i am sure it is you know it is just the circles i move in 

Recording: (2458/ 9621) 
um-hum oh yes you you know well you can see it here i mean you uh see so i am nineteen year old or eighteen year old uh b from now see uh difference in the majority you know of of another couple or three different people or whatever uh i do not know whether me coming from like a rural area you know my a and everything uh i think it maybe has something to do with that even to that you know you are more uh family oriented uh uh your your friends are basically you know you count them on your hands which you still can and but uh but he socialized a lot more up here in the city with more people and everything more if you come from like a smaller town you tend to socialize with a certain people you know group or or whatever 

Recording: (2459/ 9621) 
uh i got done out of high school 

Recording: (2460/ 9621) 
i mean he is he is kind of in big trouble they they are wanting to pull the charter on him and everything so that but he is going to try and um keep the school open which is gonna be ridiculous

better so long 

Recording: (2464/ 9621) 
eight my job i am doing at work she ai not 

Recording: (2465/ 9621) 
i do not agree with that at all i think if their parents are unhappy together the only thing that is going to happen is it is going to trick down and you are going to have to listen to them being miserable and and i think it is much more in their fight and then you feel like that your you know people feel it is my fault because this happened and you know and i think for yeah it was easier that they split up when i was younger than i can not imagine being a teenager and having my parents split up i think that that would be probably very difficult um so i do not so that is a totally different perspective to to look at it from from that point of view just because i was a lot younger 

Recording: (2466/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2467/ 9621) 
like while she was studying or something i think we played this homeless simpsons movie she got she got so mad it was so worth it 

Recording: (2468/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2469/ 9621) 
it it might uh it might um i was going to say earlier and i and i forgot to mention it is that one of the best campaigns i have seen in recent years usedizing collegeate students has been clinton is campa both times uh he knew he needed to get a base to increase uh his chances of winning the election and did especially in the first campaign in i believe that was ninety two did a really super job of organized college students because that is when you are at your most um well when you believe even things in your at your most idealistic and you would think that you know kids would automatically be interested in something and he was able to tap into that uh in a in addition to that and is an under current it was not a very good in the clinton campaign but i know when i talked to people uh and you have to be careful where you do this because abortion is not a very a vice of issue in this country and i think it does mobilize people but it also divisions them you know it it <laugh> almost like in vietnam almost like that war to fight okay people um but i would tell many many women that they had to vote for clinton because it was the difference between protecting robvers is weight and not and in protecting choice you know um and i i am starting to see that now even in in the gore campaign or i have seen a couple of editorials in the paper about you know oh the next president will again have an opportunity to point two to three supreme court justices and if that if you want to protect that right you have got to vote with the candidate who is going to put the best justices on the supreme court and i got a lot of people to vote for clinton that way both in ninety two and again in four years at ninety six uh and i think that is going to happen again because the the candidates and i am telling you my politics here are very clearly and early but the candidates have pretty well spoken on that issue already i know which one will protect the right for choice uh and um i i think we need to protect that so yes i think it will but i do not think it is an issue you that if you did overtly and said you know support canada or canada b because they will protect the abortion rate that is going to the fight the country and not keep us together 

Recording: (2470/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2471/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (2472/ 9621)

Recording: (2473/ 9621)

Recording: (2497/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (2498/ 9621) 
really you know i agree i mean none of the above that you go and i think a lot of more people would certainly go out they would vote for none of the above and then we could have some working at it 

Recording: (2499/ 9621) 
yeah i know it is good one of us <laugh> 

Recording: (2500/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2501/ 9621)

Recording: (2503/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2504/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2505/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2506/ 9621) 
obviously it is not something new that is been coming around i mean it is i have been around for a long time 

Recording: (2507/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2508/ 9621) 
well what and what my opinion on our whole penal system is just you know well it goes along we they are kind of neglecting the kids in our schools right now now we are definitely neglecting criminals they need to have be educated and and worked with i mean they need to obviously they some place some point they have uh learned incorrect correct reasoning or whatever you call it and and they need to you uh they need to have psychological help period 

Recording: (2509/ 9621) 
but it did not bother me uh religions basically everybody when i was in their back in the sixties uh i mean everybody was pretty much a christian you know christianity a uh nowadays you know you have the uh uh more outspoken us on muslims and us ones and uh island been uh jeez i just use them and everything so and then there again i do not have a problem with that you know because you you have got a neat yourself you know you have got to make your piece with your makeer you know if you believe in religion you are are here separately for an attorney later on you know 

Recording: (2510/ 9621) 
news have been real helpful you know with uh uh being that support you know my parents are very supportive but you know it was just sickening they i want to i sat down there and they just you know thes starting at a hundred twenty five thousand dollars and actually they offered us twelve thousand dollars and my attorney looked at them and said all right if i can run this this guy had his head split up and and it was your neglect so you know will take that as an assault 

Recording: (2511/ 9621) 
to come in to make came with our neighbors life years ago you knew everybody in in town well the town i grew up from a summer station i do not know if you like oh tenylvania town or not but it is <laugh> a very big town and everybody knew everybody 

Recording: (2512/ 9621) 
i wish i knew the answer uh but the reality you know uh i just feel sorry for the the people that not only feel that they have to do that but and also for the people that are involved in it and the other those victims and everything and their parents and their everything the only one i really had uh i was really upset with uh the kind of mind deal and that was because uh the one kid was making bonds and stuff like that and the base of it and the person knew nothing about it or or they did they did not even think anything about and i do not think that behavior is uh appropriate for uh sixteen seventeen year old kid um 

Recording: (2513/ 9621) 
um because he he likes the you want through the i just hitting spell or you like to hit people and i smack his hands for that and i turn right off the yeah but it is oh i have not even i tried it so often

Recording: (2517/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2518/ 9621) 
nothing serious now 

Recording: (2519/ 9621) 
so i mean basically the entire winter i would either be doing stuff by myself or on the team wrestling with my friends so the whole reason they quit wrestling is because the coach wanted me to cut too much weight um i have i was really starting to feel it physically 

Recording: (2520/ 9621) 
okay so our back ones still there but ultimately as we get traffic uh measurements but we will be able to down size the number of prices we have so streamlining our network work 

Recording: (2521/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2522/ 9621)

Recording: (2523/ 9621) 
whatever you want sure

Recording: (2528/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2529/ 9621)

Recording: (2530/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (2531/ 9621) 
i that is another thing that that we are i am in the office with my parents who that they do not understand the fact that why would i go to college i paid for it myself i work to my way through school i was so proud of the fact that i was like only a quarter late of my actual schedule to graduate which is pretty amazing given the fact that i was paying for it as i went in and and i did not have any loans i was when i was done it was paid for and so um of course tuition was a hundred twenty five dollars a quarter but i was only making you know fifty cents an hour at the bevely across the street on the al avenue so um uh but but anyhow you know they could never understand you know you did not you never got a job with it you know why would you go to school waste all that money i i ever spent this money i ever spent 

Recording: (2532/ 9621) 
you know they are just trying to spread out a little bit and eventually it will be something a little more nationwide but they really just wanted to start off with something easy and um they only take national merit dollars and uh yeah 

Recording: (2533/ 9621) 
turn the turn the music up and it is already blasted you know 

Recording: (2534/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2535/ 9621) 
and they phone a lot and there is a lot of violence and then i swear i have not seen a inney movie that does not have violence in it 

Recording: (2536/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2537/ 9621) 
absolutely 

Recording: (2538/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2539/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (2540/ 9621) 
well it is going to be easier than this you know 

Recording: (2541/ 9621) 
in the world 

Recording: (2542/ 9621) 
yeah exactly exactly 

Recording: (2543/ 9621) 
yeah and just a couple things i remember when i first started going to the unitary church up here on uh well when i was in sunday school we we drove there from reynoldsburg by going up i think reynoldsburg near walley road up to uh more slowed and then over on more slowed to high street so it was it was from the back roads you know <laugh> and that was before the mid sixties when the freeway was built i seventy was built through the town and a lot of a lot of times you do not realize what kind of habit that creates when a free ways built through the middle of the town because you have to take out of lawn houses to do that <laugh> and you you can sort of realize that if you ever go around the area and go to one of those little side streets that dead ends because of the freeways there and see the side street continue on the other side and you think about there must have been twenty or three houses that they had to take out out of here 

Recording: (2544/ 9621) 
but they lived in a beautiful home i mean if you ever to i mean kids like that i can see if they are in poor in harland or whatever but these kids lived in in a nice neighborhood in a beautiful home in colorado i mean you know i just think they were removed from what their children and their son was doing 

Recording: (2545/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2546/ 9621) 
so it is not uh there was a man named sun man who was uh recruitinguting women you know and uh out on the head of sweat naked 

Recording: (2547/ 9621) 
i mean i could practically graduate already i have all their credits but then you have those required classes that you have to take 

Recording: (2548/ 9621) 
i do not say that of all of the kids because i know that some of them were brought up right 

Recording: (2549/ 9621) 
you know my older sister a different case you look better but it it you know as long as you have a good parent it you know i think that is really all that matters because my mom home was my mother and father she she did very well 

Recording: (2550/ 9621) 
medicare type of 

Recording: (2551/ 9621) 
oh wow how would you pick up with that or it you just happened 

Recording: (2552/ 9621) 
yes private homes and um actually where i work there is not a facility 

Recording: (2553/ 9621) 
go out 

Recording: (2554/ 9621) 
but on the way i can get a raise over there where i work at 

Recording: (2555/ 9621) 
he was living at this one family for a while uh and they were noticed and taking him to news camps and stuff like this and uh what do you think they would they never had in contact with us they just let them move in can you imagine letting a fourteen year old friend just move in and not find out why really 

Recording: (2556/ 9621) 
i mean colin powell was pretty close if he would have ran 

Recording: (2557/ 9621) 
her house in india is like it is mentioned and they have servants there i mean it is really impressive just the house they just worth more so you can not getting much houseier but yeah everybody is doing well <laugh> 

Recording: (2558/ 9621) 
it 

Recording: (2559/ 9621) 
to be coming to many games as we can um uh we both golf and um we like hiking swimming um every year we used to go on a trip this year we went to new mexico we would think about moving out there 

Recording: (2560/ 9621) 
we do we develop a lot of software in projects and i control it on the data base side 

Recording: (2561/ 9621) 
and it is been good for my son 

Recording: (2562/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2563/ 9621) 
and you do not we do not to this that so i am trying to stick to that so that is right um 

Recording: (2564/ 9621) 
yeah and and the problem is uh the problem is seeing things in other people i mean actually seeing spirit you know they are people in terms of someone said they eyes the mirror did not solve that is very true you know i could see in certain people is eyes when i was in the hospital the confusion the unsure feelings you know the uh i do not know just something that i could see there that yeah they can not explain it and they still can not explain it i just know what i see and then i go on trying to tell the psychologists psychiatrist for the they want to put me on some kind of antifluis and jennic medication and i said well this is man you know i am not loose in any 

Recording: (2565/ 9621) 
so i keep it was it but then the move well there we go 

Recording: (2566/ 9621) 
right right 

Recording: (2567/ 9621) 
by the eighth grade they are sixth and seventh graders you pretty much know everything and you are the stupid one but by the time they get to eighth grade they are going we are the best teacher i could believe it it is not that to you <laugh> 

Recording: (2568/ 9621) 
now i think uh in my opinion i think mainly mainly uh it is the absence of uh basically parenting you know uh uh my mom was there uh she was a housewife you know and uh so she was she went to work after them i think when i was a junior in high school you know and my brother and all my brothers and sisters are graduated you know so 

Recording: (2569/ 9621) 
she went to nice school she just barely works at all apparently 

Recording: (2570/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2571/ 9621) 
not really he is kind of lay on the floor and watch everybody else go around 

Recording: (2572/ 9621) 
you know you have to be a good example i mean if you if you are just that for your kids then that is all they need you know you might not always do the right things or say the right things but if you are taking care of yourself and you stay positive and do the right things and think that is the best you can do for them 

Recording: (2573/ 9621) 
so he gives them a drug call well future one which is a what else like an in and i depressed type thing that they said works for um eightyd but it really helped him you know concentrate to be able to study 

Recording: (2574/ 9621) 
i am doing different points today i dont know 

Recording: (2575/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (2576/ 9621) 
but it made a lot of people more aware 

Recording: (2577/ 9621) 
well i think they need to do away with a lot of the foster homes uh you know a lot of the you know there is people with good intentions but i just think that it just needs to be rest structured a totally different way and uh you know maybe pull these kids uh into more of a group setting or something and give them more um you know counseling uh professional you know counseling because it is uh you know i i did not have good experiences with foster homes and and i knew uh a lot of kids you know that are saying that i think the parents have too many rates you know in the courts and there is just a lot going on you know that uh it is not going to get better it is going to get worse you know with the way families are torn apart now and uh you know mothers have to work and uh you just can not you know stay home and be that uh you know perfect mom you know so there is just a lot going on uh that needs to be rest structured so 

Recording: (2578/ 9621) 
the 

Recording: (2579/ 9621)

Recording: (2580/ 9621) 
if you were not here well he was the first capital punishment case in ohio in uh twenty or twenty five years or something like that and he he would kills somebody and he was on death row and he wanted to be executed and i thought that is a copout if there ever was one just to get give him a lethal injection and let him go he should have run it in prison for him <laugh> no that is not a putt he was off his rocker there was not anybody who murders who is not insane 

Recording: (2581/ 9621) 
and they had they they went through their own training and everything and we did not ever face with each other or nothing like that you know i mean you might see one walkin or march and somewhere but as far as brotherizing you were not allowed to 

Recording: (2582/ 9621) 
it so corrupt they have two choices to stay in it and try or to come to all the things and ninety percent of them i do not know whether you can see what out in washington have becomeed you know there is i do not i do not hear any of them raising how about what really matters in this country 

Recording: (2583/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (2584/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2585/ 9621) 
um i do not really know i see i mean it is definitely okayless nature and definitely something has to be done to them 

Recording: (2586/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2587/ 9621) 
just a little hard to accept uh you know and it is it is it is hard to know what he is going through or how much of it is um normal teenage rebally and and how much of it is just 

Recording: (2588/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2589/ 9621) 
well yeah when he was i do not remember how many months they went on for like two months where he just cried it might have been kind of like or whatever but he just cried and yep 

Recording: (2590/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (2591/ 9621) 
and because about the um um running director that was here at the time he quit because he did not want to fire them and they over ruled him 

Recording: (2592/ 9621) 
and so i get a lot of you know what from my sisters <laugh>

Recording: (2594/ 9621) 
yeah i was in the sales department through telephone marketing there was actual sales that i was doing i was there for fifteen years 

Recording: (2595/ 9621) 
it is like a double scene i guess we 

Recording: (2596/ 9621) 
and then remember back on it 

Recording: (2597/ 9621) 
like everywhere but uh it is real weird 

Recording: (2598/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2599/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2600/ 9621) 
well i think that my opinion is that if you can go to school and you are not going you know at work and everything you should uh be doing something besides causing problems you know you know a lot of kids that is all they really want to do nowadays is just cause an aggravation opinion 

Recording: (2601/ 9621) 
to the hub uh which of course made down time but with uh that we were not in the position to monitor traffic 

Recording: (2602/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (2603/ 9621) 
and i think um of course we would all hope that abortion would not be that that nobody would have an abortion that would be the perfect world is nobody would ever be in a situation where they would need one um but i also think i you know i i mean yeah they should not be they should not you should not spend six weeks on abortion or six weeks on what to do if you are pregnant uh but but i think the subject has to be mentioned just just in passing in health class maybe and then and then there ought to it should be it it should be known that you can go to your counselor 

Recording: (2604/ 9621) 
yeah i sit there and go you know i tell people i said it would be a clinic and everything they got a homeless thing uh over there and i said you know this guy friend i know you know he said being on debt you guys need to get out to them and help them you know i mean you are in more of a uh situation than i am to be able to go out and and and sit to a but he must be taking like mary aben or something like that and he is been there before and all he does is they throw his over his up and goof back out 

Recording: (2605/ 9621) 
of the medical school class which is two hundred twenty 

Recording: (2606/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (2607/ 9621) 
needs journal all the all the kids went into that just so intensive and they were supposed to be real good guys but i mean uh the visual was pretty miserableable in my opinion they wore these math and hoods and 

Recording: (2608/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2609/ 9621) 
kind of you know we know but it 

Recording: (2610/ 9621) 
that would be great i would do it definitely 

Recording: (2611/ 9621) 
if you got a car it is easy to get there yeah but uh if you if you are right above it sometimes so takes a couple hours 

Recording: (2612/ 9621) 
in some ways i like it and some ways it is not my favorite place but it seems like it is relatively safe place to live although that is coming from i mean i have been robbed a gun point or and i have point about four times i think in columbus yeah maybe five um i drove a taxi cab for a couple of summers and i was robbed i think twice driving the cab and part of it was just being stupid but it was down around the mountain very big area and uh it got very little money but i was not heard it <laugh> 

Recording: (2613/ 9621) 
on tv and in the movie 

Recording: (2614/ 9621) 
i love columbus actually um when i left i was fed up with columbus and but like anything you know after being away for a while and not really you know being i mean i have friends there and everything but you know i miss my friends and i miss really sort of you knowing everything in the city because london is never gonna be like that for me you know and it is just a totally different experience and you know i did miss columbus and i am kind of glad to be back i missed one did not it <laugh> 

Recording: (2615/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2616/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2617/ 9621) 
they tried sampling well our brother rich was one of the families they sampled 

Recording: (2618/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2619/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2620/ 9621) 
instead they pick up on oh so and so it was arrested for drug dealing today he you know so and so age and they sort of give background on him and that what everyone bases their view on it seems to be is that everyone turns to the media to see what is going on when the media is only showing one side of the story i mean there is definitely much more out their that is going on then they are killing you um so i really do not see a big problem with the way the america is going or whatever to the youth uh and like i would not say it is any worse than any past generations to me in other than like i mean obviously say guns and things like that are being around but simply the reason being was because in past generations they were not around for it 

Recording: (2621/ 9621) 
yeah that we did not really get the the video tape they gave us was half informalals and then <laugh> it was going to like things they had to clean the will go quick way i mean that is like that but you you were as far as actual parenting things right there was really nothing 

Recording: (2622/ 9621) 
yeah it actually his dad is mother babysit 

Recording: (2623/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2624/ 9621) 
but the professors seem more centered centered to me they are like you have to balance it which i am sure is the truth you know you can not diminished all your bottom line for you know making your work your feel good but there is still something to it i think 

Recording: (2625/ 9621) 
again gets back to the ten percent tiding and uh uh i think it is something else in the bible where you know she the lady gives gives only a small course compared to large portion but in relation to what her income was they meant a lot more and that we need to get more involved in that we need to promote more of that if we are going pocket things and materialized we need to take more of that but i think right take home and i what would you be doing if you were a third world country did not have choice 

Recording: (2626/ 9621) 
i said this will never work i am not interested to take it back and he said no no no just let us just work with it just work with it so i end up giving him for a higher forty four but it was just funny because i thought i thought they are never gonna get to where i have to be and we are not even gonna play this game back and forth 

Recording: (2627/ 9621) 
i thought it was stupid 

Recording: (2628/ 9621) 
um i mean obviously it is something that happens every day and things like that um it is like i said by no means in my saying yeah go president clinton or anything like that but uh i mean i can not say it hold it against him for doing something like that i mean it is something that threaten the nation or whatever 

Recording: (2629/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (2630/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2631/ 9621) 
uh i think that 

Recording: (2632/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2633/ 9621) 
um-hum um-hum yeah i guess my i guess what i would say mostly is for that that is that the parents are too busy with their own careers and they do not take time to raise their kids and establish the moral and the home and they are just like oh well they will learn it there or whatever and the kids um they are basic where they learn things is their peers they do not get everything in still at home uh that is pretty much what you know i seeing talk it to my husband and you know and there are so many broken homes and single moms and trying trying to do it all and the kids are the ones that are suffering and have them grow up before they are ready 

Recording: (2634/ 9621) 
i think there might be but i think most of them are dying breed they are the older citizens um many in my generation and they there is probably be because i am i am the early baby boom i am i am the first of the baby boom uh and that is when the woman is movement started and many men they are still have not always accepted that so there there might be a problem there but for the the the generations even the later baby boom generations behind me when i talk to them i talk to uh high school students or even young college students um there there is a whole world of difference between their attitudes and a lot of things and you know women is minority issues they just slap in hand to them and they you know it is not like it was for us which was a sea change for them it is normal for and more of those people are in the voting population if they would you know you would have to find a kennedy who would know how to do what clinton did in ninety two and get out that college vote 

Recording: (2635/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2636/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2637/ 9621) 
they just had a baby couple days ago yeah they have a little boy and i got a little sister she is twenty two and she lives with her boyfriend 

Recording: (2638/ 9621) 
uh not as much as i used to be when i was younger must be die hard but not anymore you know umhumum yep by their standards but they still were six or six you know and they probably could afford maybe a couple more games but that is about it you know really 

Recording: (2639/ 9621) 
uh-huh it it was cool <laugh> yeah so i i like pretty much all kinds of music yeah the big sometimes define kind of music i really do not like that much and i like some country music my i guess my favorites are are classical and uh rock rock and roll especially i like some of the so it is coming down now i like oldies the seventies the sixties and uh i guess what is hard for me to listen to is i do not know it used to be wmc i where they part of the reason was they they just played the same songs over and over again yeah 

Recording: (2640/ 9621) 
oh my gosh they do not have any of these like student mattoes especially going up like up like fifty huh <laugh> 

Recording: (2641/ 9621)

Recording: (2643/ 9621) 
to do that 

Recording: (2644/ 9621) 
well that 

Recording: (2645/ 9621) 
i should not be having to clean quite as much as i do now um i would say by ten they should be able to help me prepare a meal or be able to pretty much do most of it by themselves i know i did it and and to be able to do their laundry maybe definitely help out a lot around the house 

Recording: (2646/ 9621) 
hum

Recording: (2663/ 9621) 
you know how to modify like i give in services all the time at my school for the regular red teachers and i show them they go well that is going to make more work for me and i say how is telling the student to do every other problem instead of all forty of them going to make 

Recording: (2664/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (2665/ 9621) 
um-hum

do you know what i mean 

Recording: (2667/ 9621) 
yeah one of my uh friend is cousins went to that for kennedy um i do not remember what the cause was of his death um but i mean like i said i mean they definitely use a dangerous drug to be used and and i mean not to say that they should legalize it or anything i mean obviously that is pretty extreme to do but like i said i mean it is something more that where people should know the risks of it and and i know what goes into it i mean it is sort of like like if you saw something laying on the street and you decided to eat it or whatever 

Recording: (2668/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2669/ 9621)

Recording: (2676/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (2677/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2678/ 9621) 
and it is like a car has a computer but it does not know if it is uh monday or two thousand and fifty it has no idea it it means nothing it not dead sensitive you know so 

Recording: (2679/ 9621) 
no we have been yeah it was the only german flavor so we are uh pro double guys 

Recording: (2680/ 9621) 
and pardon him sounds pretty good so 

Recording: (2681/ 9621) 
i like it better than a magazine 

Recording: (2682/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2683/ 9621) 
uh it was for me and a couple of other people and that was it 

Recording: (2684/ 9621) 
but 

Recording: (2685/ 9621) 
well i am among the people i know i i you know works i i think it is a pretty tolerant city um uh i know a lot of people who live down in old town you know in a very uh diverse environment and uh um uh i am i just do not i do not put es i do not think 

Recording: (2686/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah no there was more uh just getting you know going out uh you know what is the one you doing saturday night nothing going to go out yeah yeah we just go out you know and if you get a kiss or something you know or got ridged up to the old you know i mean you know 

Recording: (2687/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2688/ 9621) 
yeah more yeah or more you know i i do not even know because to start it is just such a huge problem and it is gotten so out of hand it is going to be everybody all together that has to right because it cracks me up because we are so concerned about alien this just poor little kid everybody knows who he is but you know you look at our own kids we do not even care about our own kids as much as we care i mean here is this little kid who still has a living period and and i do not understand that at all i mean that is just so i think the government gets involved in totally you know lay out of line and 

Recording: (2689/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2690/ 9621) 
um this stuff as opposed to like sitting around and playing computer games first of all because it is more interesting it is a lot more practical yeah it is a little more problem solving less right around the shooting things you know um it is like problem solving they you know little puzzles it is not as much sit in front of a tv and be entertained it is you create your own entertainment oh 

Recording: (2691/ 9621) 
oh i do not i do not believe it you can 

Recording: (2692/ 9621) 
yeah i do not see that kind of raise in at all 

Recording: (2693/ 9621) 
it it is interesting too because when she had her other child uh her she had made a range she was at a honorbird now and she was made a range the reason that uh she might have to be in the hospital taking a final with one of her teachers that baby was born in march so i think she got the finals right in or you know it is just too much stress for me to even think about <laugh> 

Recording: (2694/ 9621) 
even though i knew better at the point when i was faced with that at seventeen or whatever i wanted to be loved so bad that it was something that i you know what i mean and i knew better but you just you know and it is like well i was not that strong granted but i was probably the normal team and i think most of the people well i knew at that age were lost it much younger than seventeen you know i <laugh> i have eleven twelve so i can we would look alike <laugh> but for good but um yeah so i think i think birth control would be good and 

Recording: (2695/ 9621) 
end of march i do not have a point to get you know to have a year old pass though 

Recording: (2696/ 9621) 
um-hum he was he did some assistant coach work at uh lsuis u perotas u he really liked that um <laugh> 

Recording: (2697/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2698/ 9621) 
because apparently they apparently they get really fascinated by the fact that the lights are moving around right in front of them so i do that for i do run from the front of my face and they would be like doing the same thing 

Recording: (2699/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2700/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (2701/ 9621) 
i was married but i did not have any kids one sure have kids and not gonna be able to do that kind of a schedule but um yeah so i did not take off anytime and then one when i got my master is i ran into an old friend of mine who teaches in worth and he said oh i am the special ed director up there now we need a resource from teacher one she come up in interview for this position or that position or when i went up and interviewed for that position and got another position but anyway it all worked out 

Recording: (2702/ 9621) 
yeah yeah just sit on the she is not allowed on the couch but we had caught her last winter on the couch you know you come home and it is warm and hey there is a doggy bone up here hum 

Recording: (2703/ 9621) 
even they do not get fax right a lot of the time uh 

Recording: (2704/ 9621) 
and i could not be part of a veterinarian practice that uh did that 

Recording: (2705/ 9621) 
um there were one or two 

Recording: (2706/ 9621) 
oh sure yeah 

Recording: (2707/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2708/ 9621) 
but that is what i 

Recording: (2709/ 9621) 
so it is really weird because uh 

Recording: (2710/ 9621) 
um-hum right right and and it seems to me kind of a questionable thing just how the teacher i am supposed to get an a what is wrong with you <laugh> that is wrong with you 

Recording: (2711/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2712/ 9621) 
huh 

Recording: (2713/ 9621) 
of course that never happened 

Recording: (2714/ 9621) 
so it worked out well 

Recording: (2715/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2716/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2717/ 9621) 
and it is more and more people are getting older and older they will be more neat <laugh> if you feel a lot of things that is going to be more needful as people get over 

Recording: (2718/ 9621) 
oh i feel funny that uh i mean i wish i was married if i was married it would be so much simpler in life but you know it just did not work out you know i was with his father for like nine years until i was sixteen and he just did not grow up once we had him he did not change like i changed and so 

Recording: (2719/ 9621) 
i do not want either of these people 

Recording: (2720/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (2721/ 9621) 
yeah he is a real nice guy 

Recording: (2722/ 9621) 
<laugh> yeah you should be we are all aware because the school has a big impact on the children and sometimes not all that positive right now so you know but you can tell how your child is doing of course 

Recording: (2723/ 9621) 
um seventeen and nineteen 

Recording: (2724/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2725/ 9621)

Recording: (2728/ 9621) 
this is the only society that labels them mentally ill 

Recording: (2729/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (2730/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2731/ 9621) 
but at the same time i mean i do not just like them or anything for it i mean it is it is their choice i mean in fact of the matter is it does not have any effect or anything i got my light so 

Recording: (2732/ 9621) 
i picked up one kid he he had been in uh he was only about fifteen he was adopted and even got away 

Recording: (2733/ 9621) 
no i mean like i said i think little kids are going to be little kids if that stuff was not on tv they are still going to act the same way they are still going to be walk around with toy guns and things like that playing in war or whatever 

Recording: (2734/ 9621) 
i mean i mean that is that is a lot of money for having a good time you know 

Recording: (2735/ 9621)

um i do not i mean there definitely is that image of you know dallas and dimeses i think it is it is worse i think for the the image of the taurus like basically they think anyone who can afford to be over there must be absolutely loaded you know and that was sort of another thing when you know i went to school there is you know i had a scholarship that is how i went there you know and i worked the whole time of theism school in college and all this kind of thing but it was just like you know people just thought oh you are american you are here therefore you must have lots of extra money to throw around and you know you know they just sort of do not grasp the fact that you know you can not have made sacrifices to be there but i do think oh in some you know i remember actually being in bristol that some california with brad pennsylvania at lewis and you know they are on the trail or in everything else and you know their accent and and i remember a bunch of people were sitting in this sort of round room watching this and they said like oh you know something like is that what they talk like or is that what it is like in the south and i thought oh my gosh you know what an image to have of like the south and you know i was just kind of shocked at this but i think that they are you know i went to university of that and things like that there is not necessarily that opinion maybe you know in a certain sector like when all you have or it is the consumption and everything else there might be more of that idea but i think you know most people like me or whatever they they well i should not say like but you know people who have more education sort of not even without having to really think about but you know there is not just that blatant view i mean i think that it is um the consumption thing like i think a lot more to realize now that you know i think americans have this just reputation which is totally true for like spending spending spending and like obviously when you give that a closer look at so many people are in debt i mean i think i just saw something else in the news that said you know across the um and we do not even break even where like negative one or something

Recording: (2803/ 9621)

right 

Recording: (2808/ 9621) 
it is a no it is a uh clinical study where we are seeing how treadmill training affects the same violation and people just about have quite injee 

Recording: (2809/ 9621) 
i appreciate your opinions but were you asking did you have we seen a change in the politicians and through our lifetime was that particularly your point point 

Recording: (2810/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2811/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (2812/ 9621) 
how uh do you think there is a heaven 

Recording: (2813/ 9621) 
i think it is harder on him because he is demanding of my attention and i think that is a little harder because he was an only child for nearly five years so it it is been an investment for him but he loves his baby brother uh it is it is really he he nurses them too so that is neat to watch 

Recording: (2814/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2815/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2816/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2817/ 9621) 
yeah i have i have always lived in columbus yeah 

Recording: (2818/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2819/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2820/ 9621) 
i went to ou for about three months but i was just got out of school you know to 

Recording: (2821/ 9621) 
i would just tell him that is just a feeling he is gone to you he you know i i have went to that where you know you you look at a woman and your she is attractive to you know but that is just something that is going through your mind and i think it is like the devil getting into because i would never sleep with a woman i would never do you even though i might be really would have been real drunk or you know or not drunk and just you know i would just tell them that is something he is going through and that is for him to do that and he you know he is a man and that would tell them god did not put too many men on the earth and if he would still choose to do that that i would not hate them or this own them or anything like that 

Recording: (2822/ 9621) 
the opportunity to serve one another and uh that is the downfall of our society because we are thinking more of ourselves it is they were others and i think as you as we become older you start thinking about how uh much your witnesses are but really your witnesses are the strength you pull from your faith it is not not the o toalistic things that the university here uh professors to be the thing 

Recording: (2823/ 9621) 
i know and you know and the thing is you are going to have a a great time with their kids and it is just it is it is it is almost like if it had to be like that for me to realize that but like this it is worth it 

Recording: (2824/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (2825/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (2826/ 9621) 
i do it so 

Recording: (2827/ 9621) 
he will basic you know he will basically tell you he do not have any father except for me 

Recording: (2828/ 9621) 
well i 

Recording: (2829/ 9621) 
well as it turned out he expected us to play the solo <laugh> but we did not play the whole piece we only played one movement of it and uh i thought it came out pretty well i have it recording of it for a while there i was worried that we did not get recording of it and i was really upset <laugh> 

Recording: (2830/ 9621) 
right you you you can not really ignore i have heard people say i refuse to read it as a matter of the time so you do not know what is going on locally i am sorry but uh 

Recording: (2831/ 9621) 
and so that is a whole different that is real different from the way it used to be even though it looks the same 

Recording: (2832/ 9621) 
yeah up on down the floor of 

Recording: (2833/ 9621) 
if if you did not own let us say on the school i mean you did not you pay taxes i always get because i rent and i always get very upset and i am very angry when people say well you do not have to pay school taxes yes i do because every time a school tax passes my rent goes up it is built into the rent uh at least it it ought to be or i have a pretty dumb landlord <laugh> uh and i i do not i have never lived any place where my rent did not go up after school every past and usually in direct proportion and beyond you know uh of what the levy was uh so that would be the first thing i would say and then i would also say that you know uh because i i a number of reasons that people do not vote for school at least now is because they do not have kids in the schools you know but education is the foundation of a democracy and if you do not have an educated citizenry uh your democracy could go down the drain uh that was why thomas jefferson founded so many schools or you know the the university of virginia and believed in education you know because he said without an educated citizen you will not understand the issues you know but it is very difficult today to get to people um i have talked to some uh almost college age students and they do not see the relationship you can talk of logic to them all you want and it is not like the logic gets to them and you can talk history all you want and it does not mean anything to them and i do not know why i at least they did but they do not know why 

Recording: (2834/ 9621) 
i had considered that yes 

Recording: (2835/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah i well i think basically that goes back to uh you know the parenting and everything you know there is something missinging in the uh uh the child is life you know uh uh that he was not getting perhaps attention uh uh those kids in particular i do not understand how they could be building bonds and been their basement and mom and dad not know what were going on i i mean uh it is just a trying i had a friend when i was a kid too that uh uh we were like i do not know uh two years old or something like that well they are accidental shooting and then and then uh uh another friend of mine from the same same class you know uh he poured gun shot him you know and did not know that the anything was lived at but and they were talking about another thing about that you know where some kid i guess that happened just here in town a couple of them that we could give or something to that you know or a guy shot another guy but i mean those things are just senseless crimes really uh and who is really he is a fault and he is really he is guilty i do not know uh i would like to have uh been not today they ever would have but if they one of the two that you uh could long find you know if they would have survived i do not like to see them that was going through their heads you know but that is something we have never know 

Recording: (2836/ 9621) 
she did not she did not say anything i mean they would not let her 

Recording: (2837/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2838/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (2839/ 9621) 
yeah well there is too many situations out there to have everybody fit into certain ones it is just everyone of them is different 

Recording: (2840/ 9621) 
what is different uh my old neighborhood is just exactly the same and so from that angle was i mean still is my elementary school sitting there i went to for nine years and then north is not being used as a high school but it is there a block away oh and ten she believe i am right in where i always sweat i mean i am i was raised on cuomo avenue you and i live two blocks away from there now so i made a full full circle there but columbus has changed in the downtown area and it is really neat you know there to any other cities of course i am i loved oregon i was very rural for eighteen years 

Recording: (2841/ 9621) 
oh uh-huh 

Recording: (2842/ 9621) 
it is in in education it is it is top they produce a lot of graduate and undergraduate uh education business schools coming up like they are building a new building but by i i will be gone by the time if i decide to stay so it it will be so as far as uh education like for small school and they just open up with their phd for government education and they are also known for political science but it is a real conservative political science and they it is a real conservative school and that does not really match my my views on a lot of things uh the it is dry they have a real strict visitation policies things like that and my son is if you are in the if you are if you are considered adult all enough to move away then you should not have that many restrictions i can understand some because i remember in as a freshman in college it was we did crazy things but still 

Recording: (2843/ 9621) 
the south pacific yeah 

Recording: (2844/ 9621) 
you need you on the way around 

Recording: (2845/ 9621) 
um i think that i do not think the divorce is the bad thing i think that it is if your married and you will by the size that you get to a point where you and this other person are are not an positive relationship for each other or for anybody else in your family that it is better to just a this is not working we both deserve to be happy and we and and and go your own separate ways um i think that i think for me personally i would certainly i would certainly try very hard to be in a situation where i would not end up getting divorced just because i think it makes so i am a little bit more difficult as far as like <laugh> because i know that sounds kind of petty but just um but i i i i mean i do not think it is i do not think it is bad but i think that that if you can find a way obviously to continue to make a relationship work that you should but my parents are very different 

Recording: (2846/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2847/ 9621) 
everyone loses their funding 

Recording: (2848/ 9621) 
and then they said well since you are getting that they would well we will cut cut your pay back to what you would normally throw well i know of the print of some program 

Recording: (2849/ 9621) 
i think yeah especially the seasons

Recording: (2855/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (2856/ 9621) 
and you notice how they keep changing packages of your favorite article they have gone down then um i suppose when you get down to the meat of it it is the same thing and they said and that is where it comes down to the cafeteria church for example they can put all you can a folk masses so you can go all this superficial stuff on the thing to make get more attracted and they do every every religion that makes it more attracted for oh is using weather come from oh yeah but the bomb line is you are trying to still if you are a christian focus back to the bible 

Recording: (2857/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2858/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (2859/ 9621)

Recording: (2875/ 9621) 
you know what i mean 

Recording: (2876/ 9621) 
to some extent yeah but to some extent now because see what i was in the service it was a different 

Recording: (2877/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2878/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2879/ 9621) 
<laugh> really

um-hum 

Recording: (2882/ 9621) 
yeah well 

Recording: (2883/ 9621) 
i do believe i do believe and i think maybe uh last year was you one of the younger generation have not you had as you have grown older have not you looked back sometimes at boy mom was right about that dave was right about that i think the older a child gets and that includes us too now that we are our age because we are i am almost as old as my mother was and she died i am older than my father was when he died i do believe i see now where just living life you keep your eyes and ears open in your mind you are going to have your mind open to receive what you are watching your is going to be uh you learn things that you cannot possibly learn in a book in school they help they help you to teach it you should always keep your mind open in school but you there is a lot of things you are just not going to learn except by actually experience and living life and i believe that that is a lot of her activities i know i started to say well you know i do not think i finished it i myself have these ones getting only what i need versus all these little once and des hours because i grew up in depression and did not have these things consequently i have got a dog collection that had a very collection an angel collection record collection you would not believe uh a whole one whole wall of my room with books and books in another room the the books i started them when the kids were little because they did read at home and the light breeds where they are not near as easy to get to as they are nowadays and consequently i have kept the books and it is amazing but some of those grandchildren almost all of them can order the house and they get bored so they will go back to that book cajunal humn for something to read so it is good to have it available for them in the home to a certain extent however my one son is going to you have he is got one room he is completely in with books and a hall way part of it is just books and i do not know if the kids ever go and pick those up or not because they are always doing to the library so you see it is what it is taught bought at home that really counts but we do not need all those material things and now i am sitting back and thinking well which one of my kids which one of my grandchildren are going to keep this or shall i have an auction and spend the money on travel <laugh> you see what i mean you change your opinion is changed as you get older and you begin to look back i do not think i was ever a spendthirt to the point that i did things foolishly some things i did do foolish but i mean you know on a overall basis 

Recording: (2884/ 9621) 
can you up and light feed them and 

Recording: (2885/ 9621)

Recording: (2909/ 9621) 
no it it is in uh it is in the ag college but uh while it is there i do not know it is been a of how they fit it in there but it is doing construction management 

Recording: (2910/ 9621) 
but uh but even so uh we were on this and uh germans were up on the mountains all around just where they could again look right down at us but we we did not go out in the day light morning at all 

Recording: (2911/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (2912/ 9621)

Recording: (2913/ 9621) 
clumbus um-hum i went to it i end up in an alternative school system all along i always i got into the lottery they used i i made it into every school i applied for 

Recording: (2914/ 9621) 
i mean we went in there one day and you know i explain the whole thing to her and then she puts off some kind of an excuse the administrator she says well we do not need problem students like yourself although i said what problem 

Recording: (2915/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2916/ 9621) 
oh no never have 

Recording: (2917/ 9621) 
the right 

Recording: (2918/ 9621) 
<laugh> yeah 

Recording: (2919/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (2920/ 9621) 
i mean to mind no 

Recording: (2921/ 9621) 
yeah that is what i am saying 

Recording: (2922/ 9621) 
been to do that 

Recording: (2923/ 9621) 
you are allowed to have guests on the same side so they could say like i do not live in the dorm so the feeling i did if i were not if i would a girl come from home to visit me i would have to either sneakers or in <laugh> and like just hope we did not get caught or have her stay at a friends 

Recording: (2924/ 9621) 
my roommate 

Recording: (2925/ 9621) 
the ultimate would probably be a part type thing you know but neither one of our positions offer any type of part time work we have some friends that do that where or they only go two days a week or something which is they get a little bit of both the world so 

Recording: (2926/ 9621) 
all right she is always trying to recruit people to come and visit but it is like a two hour drive and then everybody is busy you know that is four hours of driving and um i do not know it is just too hard to keep everybody in touch that way but 

Recording: (2927/ 9621) 
humum i was at u fifteen and i was not even in u fifteen it was hundred thousand you know and uh i loved that but i then i came back can i live in ohentown she village which is right on the river and it is very uh very scenic very beautiful 

Recording: (2928/ 9621) 
yes um-hum yeah i do miss that but at the same time i have you know i had a lot of opportunity to be there and and to do those things though and i mean they are they are you know it is obviously you can not compare it but you know they are cultural things to doing columbus and it that is sort of makes me mad when you know people are kind of like oh climbers you know there is nothing to do there i find myself defending columbus a lot more now than 

Recording: (2929/ 9621) 
home back um yeah i am sure that was useful for people that did not cook or do anything showed them how to turn the oven on or 

Recording: (2930/ 9621) 
um-hum that was in sixty nine is when i went in so you know you can kind of figure that it was the 

Recording: (2931/ 9621) 
oh <laugh> 

Recording: (2932/ 9621) 
because there is no fear being caught by the parents there is 

Recording: (2933/ 9621) 
um so they sort of send them on their way or whatever and she did have the opportunity to come back 

Recording: (2934/ 9621) 
it is 

Recording: (2935/ 9621) 
hm 

Recording: (2936/ 9621) 
exactly exactly 

Recording: (2937/ 9621) 
there is no issue 

Recording: (2938/ 9621) 
and to me that is considered suburban so and to me ashe is considered the sticks i mean there is people there is onish buggy is that go by 

Recording: (2939/ 9621) 
ah i can not i can not believe it they came back 

Recording: (2940/ 9621) 
um-hum um-hum 

Recording: (2941/ 9621) 
i talk to her every day 

Recording: (2942/ 9621) 
well i am lucky in that way because um i get to travel a lot and it and so you know if there is something i really want to see chicago is not that far washington is not that far um new york and you know i do not get to new york that often but uh you know i mean i i still have access to a lot of stuff if i want to go to the trouble 

Recording: (2943/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2944/ 9621) 
so that is that is frustrating for me when you look at both of the candidates and you think i do not want either one of these people there should be another thing above you know if there is that option i am sure a lot more 

Recording: (2945/ 9621) 
be in turn to way 

Recording: (2946/ 9621) 
uh his daughter is twelve 

Recording: (2947/ 9621) 
ah probably 

Recording: (2948/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2949/ 9621) 
but now it seems like people are just they i do not know why that is a trend i mean my dad said uh he grew up in the bronx 

Recording: (2950/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (2951/ 9621) 
that is 

Recording: (2952/ 9621) 
so i almost bought one um oh black couple weeks ago in fact i went i went into contract on it with this guy this dear old man who is it was for his mother who was near nineties and uh retirement it was on the world forest which is north and i made this this slow offer and i never thought that they would i did not want it was kind of like i feel like i had to do this because i if i was going to get this house i should get it but i did not really want now because i the baby coming and we are going to be busy and i did not want to get involved in and so i made this offer and then he turned her back you know i offered him ninety two and he was asking ninety nine so he came back in ninety six and i said uh you know i said well i am going to have to worry about him he is never going to come to so i wrote back and said you know i appreciate your over by ninety two i ninety two is is almost not feasible for me and ninety two five was really the only thing i could i could do and i did not even give him the time to to respond because i just assumed i was just bowing out of it 

Recording: (2953/ 9621) 
um i think it is probably some of both i think it is probably more social but i mean obviously they are going to have different views on how things work um but i mean for the most part i can not see that as being too big of a problem um obviously there are more like violent guys out there and things like that than there are women but at the same time i would not say there is anything too overpower so far as the number of guys being out there or by on i mean it is something that unfortunately does happen but i mean it is more higher brought up whether you can control it or not 

Recording: (2954/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2955/ 9621) 
oh that is almost as bad as rosy becausey i have a 

Recording: (2956/ 9621) 
um yeah 

Recording: (2957/ 9621) 
oh just it was going down like 

Recording: (2958/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2959/ 9621) 
um and you kind of knew everybody around the neighborhood but i think that that still that is still the same for the neighborhood that my family lives on um so i do not i me personally other than other than the fact that maybe there is a couple more things to do there is bigger and more comfortable movie theaters and and that kind of stuff it has not really 

Recording: (2960/ 9621) 
but usually she is looking for something to eat you know 

Recording: (2961/ 9621) 
sometimes i think it is been a very bad influence on certain aspects of life on others i think it is been very good because at least let us us know what is going on in the rest of the world and and if it were not for that some of the things we would not know and i think that is you increase your knowledge you are far better off <laugh> than to stay in this little hole here and this is all i want to know about 

Recording: (2962/ 9621) 
yeah they do 

Recording: (2963/ 9621) 
um-hum parties did not change at all 

Recording: (2964/ 9621) 
well uh the first the first thing is clintonville 

Recording: (2965/ 9621) 
i just really think he is 

Recording: (2966/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (2967/ 9621) 
surely cool yeah yeah 

Recording: (2968/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2969/ 9621) 
um i think they can help but i think it has to be something that society in general our family 

Recording: (2970/ 9621) 
put bathrooms and kitchens and stuff 

Recording: (2971/ 9621) 
i think columbus is really interesting how how it developed compared to uh like i do not know just like how indianapolis like how columbus is different it is it is a or a real standard midwest city just how it is designed and made out compared to like philadelphia you know or just like when it was settled and and when it was made just out like more the streets or more where it is all like planned out more as opposed to like in in phillie where places like that more east coast it is like the roads far it is of them are real small and like and other parts are all hilly and curving around and stuff and so it is kind of interesting i mean i think it is also i like the urban for all of the colmous house um this is just the suburbs develop up in that it is more of a metropolitan area as opposed to a centralized area that is really big like our like corner downtown is is really uh ah two i mean i mean there is nothing to do down there it is all businesses and like the couple of shops that are down there close at like six i mean there is like a couple of restaurants just or something but i mean it is it is different when you think of other cities you know it is more of like a downtown is where you go to hang out but here it is like campus and it is more and more of uh 

Recording: (2972/ 9621) 
but i mean it was nothing too serious or violent i mean 

Recording: (2973/ 9621) 
so everybody is trying to be like everyone else 

Recording: (2974/ 9621) 
oh you do not ask it easy one do you <laugh> that is that is really 

Recording: (2975/ 9621) 
and they do not wear like the lot of the way in shirts and and you know the shorts and the camera is that that they do they do they say they um do they 

Recording: (2976/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2977/ 9621) 
yeah not that they could have stopped it but they they should have known what was going on uh i really think if they were close with their children they would have known something was wrong especially to these kids they are so removed and do not talk to their parents and start dressing certain way you know that they are you know going uh turning i do not i just i blame them them 

Recording: (2978/ 9621) 
yeah i hear 

Recording: (2979/ 9621) 
yeah which is good to make it i do not ever give it or anything so 

Recording: (2980/ 9621) 
and you do not have to worry if she writes her name backwards like a mirror image 

Recording: (2981/ 9621) 
and then once a month we have a leadership module which is uh the business ethic part and you know say goal setting and that type thing and then once a month on today just how late tonight is the pizza and like just just general things like events coming up we had we planed the far neerfield last weekend in the weekend before i do not know i can not wait for it to start just because i wanna watch it on tv and i point it do not <laugh> you see that the jack nicholas golfs do not you in front of the club house i planted the flowers around that no i i do not want to watch it but golf at all i just want to turn it on and see it occasionally 

Recording: (2982/ 9621) 
nobody around not in atlanta yeah there is one she has and there is still like that so i know ah my car is not like that 

Recording: (2983/ 9621) 
i would not 

Recording: (2984/ 9621) 
yeah i do i really do i mean these kids are getting guns a lot of them is from their parents but um it is amazing how many guns and they say that the police are selling guns to people and they do not realize you know their old guns that theydustate and they do not realize where they are going i mean that amazes me um but there is a always going to be under world in different ways that kids and people can get guns and it is that i do not know how we could ever limit that but there is so many billions of guns in the world that you know you are wondering where are they all coming from um i think but i think laws can help especially with children and they have these new guns that um not just the safety lock but you know you it is like identification thing you know 

Recording: (2985/ 9621) 
oh really 

Recording: (2986/ 9621) 
oh how is the football game deal 

Recording: (2987/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2988/ 9621) 
and yet we sit down and negotiate for it and then on top of the those people that participate in the um sponsors are not just as bad 

Recording: (2989/ 9621) 
excuse me well typically what i have is they are they are conflict you know with mom in those uh i am uh well i think a lot of times when there is a stepfather involved you know that becomes a problem for some of them but they said you know you might run into a case where you know the family is abusing uh the child you know but i did not run into that 

Recording: (2990/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2991/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (2992/ 9621) 
that is why it is mainly appealing to people you they pay you to go to school 

Recording: (2993/ 9621) 
you know and they did want the children 

Recording: (2994/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (2995/ 9621) 
this falls the first time i will be so many people you know 

Recording: (2996/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (2997/ 9621) 
<laugh> uh no i do really believe that they it they would have something like that instead of some of the even the oh shows they are not good even for older people to watch they aggravate me sometimes i turn them off for some the stupid things they do 

Recording: (2998/ 9621) 
great yeah it was like oh just makes sense and you might have these other wonderful things that i am used to but he is got all of this so i will get that little slice and big grass so that worked out 

Recording: (2999/ 9621) 
to watching it for a while period and then since dspay is last they needed a little star trek fix every once in a while so i started watching it i also do not have cable so uh it is on upn and fifty three does not come in terribly well so it uh i mean sometimes it is like i do not want to kind of see what is going on but

yeah yeah because if she was they are charging her two bucks down there and i told her i said you need to really not get twenty dollars out of the time because i said you need to get like six get eighty because as you get eighty bucks out you are going to pay eight dollars for it twenty bucks at a time but if you get eighty bucks out you are going to get two bucks and she goes but if i have eighty dollars i will spend it and i says well you have the football for the lock on it put seventy dollars in there and have ten and she is like oh and i said the only reason i know that is because that is what dad is got to do <laugh> i said i i can not carry money or i spend it you know 

Recording: (3008/ 9621) 
they he remembers he he he remembers the stepfather is and and that kind of thing and just not a good stepfather

like there would be kids saying yes maam yes maam yes maam in class and then they are out there smoking at the cars or catch school and stuff uh <laugh> 

Recording: (3033/ 9621)

um-hum life skills <laugh> 

Recording: (3036/ 9621)

and i have no idea where he was uh and at the time my motherinlaw was in a nursing home had alzheimer is and my fatherinlaw was in the hospital 

Recording: (3043/ 9621) 
um-hum uh they have a whole listening of numbers of reasons why you do not want to do it and most usually i just put location i do not want to go certain places uh 

Recording: (3044/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3045/ 9621) 
i i think it is because uh when i was a sophomore in high school before it done done me that toby and flat b in the relation to this stuff that we were learning which it starts from the diagram and uh but i think kids are a lot more aware now from because of what they are exposed to you know in movies and everything and you know just tv daily life um they are a lot more aware they they have i they they go into it with a lot of of uh myths and misapprend inions but they definitely have thoughts about it and and i think they i think they need to know 

Recording: (3046/ 9621) 
yeah like when i need things and i call them up i need diapers and a wife is eight twenty dollars yeah he is there for me the for that financially uh he is always been there for me 

Recording: (3047/ 9621) 
with her eye or the car actually 

Recording: (3048/ 9621) 
like on the fair they regular basis even 

Recording: (3049/ 9621) 
yeah it is well basically it is like a it is about the size of a small hotel room and then it is got separate back yard with like a big back tub and there is like these are like oh it is a room in the little box in the wall about this bag that has like some smelly stuff coming out of it but i mean there is no enough room where people can come in sit down there is like a full out couch bad for whoever in there with you and then they have got the baby they keep the baby right there in the room with you after it is born 

Recording: (3050/ 9621) 
it was during school um you would go there you would went there for two years you would junior and senior year and um like your junior go in the morning and you are seeing it go in the afternoon but it took up pretty much your whole day half of your day actually you are at the cruise center then you go 

Recording: (3051/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (3052/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3053/ 9621) 
just because you know it was more like they seem like they wanted to be there as opposed to i am just doing this because i do not know why or whatever and it seems like too they they i hate it when people it is obvious that if they did not have the tax book they would not know how to do it you know like where if people did not have their notes like they would not be able to do it themselves you know it is kind of like um so i think it it is it when people have real enthusiasm like you know or and put a lot of effort into making it not the same everyday and not just like a lecture and then we do homework and turn it in like you know it is like we do like i guess history class we do like role role playing things and like 

Recording: (3054/ 9621) 
yeah exactly which is one of the things that ran to our architecture where i mean we only had you know one or two papers we had to write 

Recording: (3055/ 9621)

Recording: (3060/ 9621) 
they just can not think of out what i should attend to and what i should screen out so they attend to everything we equally the train going by out here the teacher talking up here the kid over here shuffing up his pencil and so they get a little bit of everything and they do not learn anything 

Recording: (3061/ 9621) 
and there is people who are like that today still you know but i think people should go to uh retirement centers uh uh and uh sit down and make a visit to them every week make a part of their life and give up a friendship 

Recording: (3062/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3063/ 9621)

Recording: (3102/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3103/ 9621) 
that is a big growing period you know from junior high to high school is when you really learn and try to decide what you want to do with your life um my mother was always home she was um which was good to come home to because i had friends this parent mother is worth there and they had to clean they had to start dinner and they hated it you know i mean and they feel that they kind of missed out on things um but i think you know kids a lot of them who have when they parents have money and um both parents work i am not sure if the combined of both parents work but i do not think just the mother being home there would have totally help you know 

Recording: (3104/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3105/ 9621)

Recording: (3108/ 9621) 
and it really is not though because once because i think it is actually it is really free not to have to drink and all these things so you just kind of i feel like i can go along with any people and so it does not really exclude you from anyone unless you would let it i guess and they will be perfect i mean everybody has their prejudices i guess and fears so getting over that part of life <laugh> for every one 

Recording: (3109/ 9621)

Recording: (3113/ 9621) 
anyly 

Recording: (3114/ 9621) 
and uh it does not hurt maintenance you know uh i think it just depends upon like i said a lot of factors you know what your neighborhood your neighbors uh those kids do not have nothing to do in their neighborhood even you know how many amy lives do you see nowadays it still comes back to like when i was a kid we had go cards we had many by we had all that kind of stuff

Recording: (3119/ 9621) 
i do not think you read about it for it myself but uh it is interesting uh uh you know when they when they first one day uh we are time began you know of course in life uh what i believe and then everything you know is man on one and got married you know and the reason they got married is because of proagreeation you know keep the keep the uh population going uh i think that is the way it was set up originally so i had an no problem with the man being with the man or one of being with the woman but uh it if that was the relationship for everybody 

Recording: (3120/ 9621) 
letterly instinct you know and they are like oh very nice you should have one and you know and he knows on the cut up one um i just knew at a young age i have always loved the animal

Recording: (3123/ 9621) 
you know so i figure it is it is much better to be nice to them because there is also times when you know everybody makes errors and you know maybe one of these times you make an error and i tell you to turn one and you go uh you know there is an airplane over there and i tell you to turn that way and i really meant for you to turn left instead of right and you may come back go and you you need me left or right there and i go he gets that is a direct turn left you know you know so you know everybody helps everybody out you know i i feel kind of goes a long way and the pilots the same way they most often they are yeah pretty decent 

Recording: (3124/ 9621) 
well i used to 

Recording: (3125/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (3126/ 9621) 
yeah uh it to to me that sort of a slap on the wrist and you tell the parents what you have done it that the kid did and you do not want him to do it again and let it go they suspended it i do not know i i would probably say this i got this version of this story from the columbus this page so it is probably not the whole story yeah it it

Recording: (3135/ 9621) 
which i feel has been completely divorced in america because of the effects of the cold war uh uh where am i going with this <laugh> um i mean the generation before us had like vietnam they protest against it i mean they were in many ways participating into the generation before but and when it came down to it i mean the what was the protest really about you know and i am not been clear because i am not exactly sure where i am going but i am very cynical up uh about the about the world i have inherited uh because i see a world in which my political views have been s is silence by fifty years of of you know like international politics uh in sort of like propaganda uh um that says you know like to be left of a certain point is bad i i do not know like among conservative circles the word liberal is is like <laugh> almost like calling so and a communist in in the forties um where it i am very cynical about that because they they feel that it was not it it is been a cultural see is completely unfair i mean i think the reason that our generation is the reason i am cynical is because we are handed a world in which we see the injusticeices of the past or not the the bidickor city i mean it gets in justice it also applies in terms of things like the cold war and stuff but that is why i am cynical i hope that answers your question in at least a little bit i do not know i feel kind of pretty cheap <laugh> like this is life as a matter of life 

Recording: (3136/ 9621)

Recording: (3141/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (3142/ 9621) 
have <laugh> well personally i voted that the thirty thirty three should have happened they should have way back on the yeah way of worrying there is this general average of the bush they he under something i said you know if you know and i and uh analyze you are saying that they are teeling only it was half i think four or two years ago it was allowing it was not done up around the floor of your area and you have not even rose and then that and i do not know i have a very general uh opposition to this kind the thing uh no matter where it is anymore uh my being seventy six years of age has a major bearing because i see the total restriction of our center is cities uh and i say when i speak of center cities i do not necessarily mean just cities the size of columbuswood is the largest one that is able oh i do not know but i am talking places like washington corehouse which may be have fifteen thousand or uh uh wadsworth which may be have eighteen thousand uh this kind of thing is being developed on the peripheral of the cities is just totally destroying those and of consequence i feel it is breaking our society down out down to the point where we do not do not know our neighbors at all anymore the it is quite common anymore that if you go three houses down you have no idea who those folks are how they feel what they might do for you or you can do for them uh and that all applies to the ped glass question as i see it and i think also that uh it it is a very very major financial uh gain for the developer who are doing it and it is going to therefore harm uh the many many areas that are affected such as north north north north north north north <laugh> <laugh> which is the name of the shop uh northwest northland yeah northern and i can not even they say that okay

Recording: (3179/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3180/ 9621) 
well i do not think they should be responsible but i think um kids go to school and they need role models good teachers um and i think schools have gotten a lot better about that it seemed like in the late eighties early nineties you know the schools a lot of them were really bad um i think finally the education department or whatever is realizing that parents need help with their kids they can not do everything and you know they just need really acr is good things when they do go to school and you know i think teachers are a big part of it i really do you know you remember when you have a good teacher and that he is learned a lot um and i think you know through education because it is hard all these schools and so many rural areas and everything trying to get good teachers and then you know it is the way it is going to have to do with money and then uh making enough money which the teachers do not make enough money and they are over work in all these big large classroom and it just seems to me one kid start dressing and getting it click together you know it would be hard for them to intervene and say oh what is going on in your life what is your what is the problem you know that that is not really she would be their role but uh if they care enough they should call the parents and they would look for word about your son he misses a lot of school or he starts the dress really you know i sometimes they should not be the dress has a lot to do with them but it seems when kids go a different way it does involve dress and just you know turning against the norm of the society you know and if they do not want to be in sports that is fine there is so many different things that they can do in in school and learn about arts and music and you know but um unfortunately i think a lot more pressure is on schools to more or less pick up this lack of what the parents can not do but in some ways it is always kind of been like that i mean it was like he went to school and they took care of me until he got home you know i mean 

Recording: (3181/ 9621) 
getting so ingested that is one i do not like

Recording: (3183/ 9621) 
and it is like i i like how check i thought about going to anyork but it it was really expensive and like um i do not know but just because it is that and and schools more of uh nonsraditional uh type where they give you like evaluation and you do not get grades like and so so then it let that is what that is what i heard is they get in there of where the professor rates uh like a couple of page paper on your like performance on the quarter and that that really shows that i mean that is a lot of work for the professor but like that really shows that he is really involved and noticing what you are doing and supposed to just like uh some kid in his class you know 

Recording: (3184/ 9621) 
well there is been quite a change in the attitude of general public i think as far as right women working away from home is concerned and uh uh i do not know i am glad that my wife was able to work there at home well actually she worked in an office when our first boy was just small

Recording: (3255/ 9621) 
i do not know uh maybe it i think if teachers just their status in society is not real high when it should be um that is more like i mean i have heard that like garbage men get paid more than teachers you know and how but it um so it is just like people always talk about you know education for that you know we have got like think about our child is future or whatever but really teachers are paid crap and like do not really get a lot of respect from anybody like professors and stuff get get like more of a respect but it is just like the like the teachers that you have especially in elementary school like in critical periods in in your life like in especially in out of lessons too like really the influence like how you are as a person and like people do not like take that for granted a lot like if you have bad teachers in one subject you are gonna hate that subject you know unless you have good teachers you are gonna love it i mean there are the only influences too like how like what you want to do with your life and and people is do not really have knowledge of that too much

Recording: (3281/ 9621) 
in most in most area and most school districts it is comparable to any other job now it used to always be low but like a beginning teacher and worthinton starts i think twenty six eight or something course warrington is one of the three highest paid districts in ohio um but used to be that teachers just got paid lower than a starting fireman or starting policeman and you know in a sense you are out there risks your your life everyday too 

Recording: (3282/ 9621) 
uh-huh in the watch those yeah you kind of like you know look it up and says you know it does not even you know got their sites on me yeah because that is uh so i can only you know that is like the world or two stuff you know there is like the remains i am sure it is like you get to see the wall it is like they are i mean i am sure they just like this there it is like you know you know so you know caustinina wire and bob wire and all those like a big big got brick wall and whatever he could actually you know still see it unless they tore it down okay just like to put to the history of it okay so you actually it is right it is neat it is like because you we are like a part of that history at least when you are over there you feel like wow it must be you know something to tell your daughter it was like i was there and one of the cool one of the cool uh usedly air as well uh because it works a lot more full than she goes to scotland see now i am going to like i am like depressed <laugh> because i man i guess they uh i gave a few months here and i wanted to go you know it is like when it gets like though be like a you you can even like do uh teaching over there like teaching english or you can be a nanny it is like so you know it is like if i have you know the right right right position opens up and stuff <laugh> i may not be becoming back anytime soon <laugh> <laugh> but you talking about fleas like like in asia oh okay yeah apparently people is down there today just lost their name just lost their name <laugh> and then they could then after that you know the many ways out they come back and then start up teaching him wow it is fantastic so i so that is not that is not the thing that makes sense i would like to like you have to have the like you know like like a doctor or any like sort of credentials whatsoever as long as you can you know talk the talk um-hum right usually get them after the english teaching costs a lot of money uh but uh but they will hire people as long to teach english really they they will not teach you the like you too and you will pay d e a person like you are today <laugh> um that would be a challenge but that would be a challenge oh yeah i just want to oh i know i i never i never looked into that but that is a good suggestion they yeah like like being because they are gonna be like you know the like spanish instructors now i i never thought of that onto just just uh just just that so yeah or like teaching english as a second language i know they teach those classes here so i was thinking well you know maybe i should start looking at any of the teaching classes but i was like well i did not know that was like true or not they can actually teach around the world because i have heard i have heard stories you know yeah you can you can it they that people people like that why <laugh> but but it is like yeah if you say it is true i can do it is that okay do you well they are learning the line is better than the whole lot from the from any speaker they are getting their real language from it rather than i think so you you um we were in the o r o like forty out a week we we be okay okay see you think of it just like one on one way just like you sit like like you know it is like if it costs you the cost of money you just have like a group conversation okay okay so they definitely work out available if you want to eat it per se wow did you did you visit spainley today i because that is one of the places on the

Recording: (3493/ 9621) 
<laugh> um and that just sound like a broken record but i really think it is our uh back slide on on family in it i think it is too easy this day i and i have been married and divorced so i have unfortunately had that experience to me um that it is too easy to get divorced um people do not really go into marriage with commitment in lifetime and have that i do not want to say old fashionsed value just the value of this is very important uh because let us face it to me love is a choice because there is times when i do not love my she is been i want to smack him and he is being a little barney but i would used to be in love with him because i made that choice and then that passes and lomba hold a hour later a week later well i think that is too easy to get divorced i i do not believe in staying in a marriage for the sake of with just children but i think if you really make that commitment and actually work on it you can have a great relationship you can have kids and bring them up in a more stable environment uh unfortunately i think that is the problem parents um or eight or getting divorced and then they get caught up in their petty little things and start putting the kids against each other you know using the kidism binium um or their two television do not listen to their kids or they did not um i do not wanna see yourself let us face it like we said you know even having a dog takes some time out of your your your schedule and um and not spending enough time with the kids you know they work in wet and on it and it takes a lot of effort to raise kids these days and actually listen to them and get to know them and let them growing things like that uh and i do not think enough families are doing that

from our friends have gone yeah what is their discipline is explaining the child from school well they are explaining them to a home where the parents work working where they are just getting three days a free play i mean pretty much to get in trouble and cause them our trouble they really are learning from that

Recording: (3689/ 9621) 
theory is oh man this needs to be helped not just you know uh well stick them in a place where they can just concentrate them on it even more so we have got a long ways to go there 

Recording: (3690/ 9621) 
um-hum

i did have a job like that one i work full time

Recording: (3748/ 9621) 
green bay packers 

Recording: (3749/ 9621) 
how am i going to tell her who is you know trying to butter me up by raising their hand in in asking questions um 

Recording: (3750/ 9621) 
perfect example you know or your computer can not tell you that you spelled o and e when you meant to spell w o n 

Recording: (3751/ 9621) 
right that is true 

Recording: (3752/ 9621) 
just like there is a lot of different uh like influences and everything and like there is just a lot of places you can go with it so it is real good 

Recording: (3753/ 9621) 
that and i heard i kind of like the change they are talking about they are talking about putting underground power lines and taking the pulls out 

Recording: (3754/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3755/ 9621) 
yeah i so that is what i am going to do just yeah 

Recording: (3756/ 9621) 
yeah i mean maybe breakins are down we are holding up seven elevens they are down but then you hear these you know murders 

Recording: (3757/ 9621) 
oh oh <laugh> 

Recording: (3758/ 9621) 
that would just be too scary for me 

Recording: (3759/ 9621) 
as back into in to high school 

Recording: (3760/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (3761/ 9621) 
yeah well uh west of them yeah so that is difficult for us to deal with 

Recording: (3762/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3763/ 9621) 
that is where we are in our evolution <laugh> 

Recording: (3764/ 9621) 
but definitely as it happened to me when i was in the third grade uh a friend of uh two of our friends were uh uh when i home after school we were playing with a gun and everything and and uh one of them will kill the other one you know accidently uh it just goes to it you know my dad always had the gun he did not have it locked up all the time but you know it was not necessarily in the same place all the time either you know i mean so if you were not really look and forth you know you have to happen to stand just happen to stand onto it or something you know uh uh i believe nowadays you know that perhaps with the uh with the guns you know they they will be able to be in more people having guns that do not know do not should not have them apparently uh you know they should be uh lock and key uh as for the you know the parents somebody is responsible in the world you know but see then you get into catch twenty two as of the legislation i mean you can not require i do not see how you you require a a a guy who buys a gun to buy a lock and then buy a say pour the for the gun and and and do all that stuff because that in case if a bird or comes into your house which is why why you have a gun anyway you have some pure or something like that half other ways you should not have one unless you are a sportsman then uh then you know you are it is not going to be worth it to have the gun in the first place so 

Recording: (3765/ 9621) 
so it is not stressful at all right i it is really easy it is not challenging 

Recording: (3766/ 9621) 
yeah he is yeah he is twenty six 

Recording: (3767/ 9621) 
probably it is you are right i i asked him what language did he have to learn to cook 

Recording: (3768/ 9621) 
um i am a great employer and i i got hired in one of the oakland interview conversations with high on and in this particular month i am going to europe but i remember when i come back he said sure let us keep talking he said okay and then we continue talking so um it is up in the air 

Recording: (3769/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3770/ 9621) 
he was always like really red face and the kids would say you know he went out at lunch and got drunk and came back and that was one of the better schools in columbus and and you know i just saw a lot of that i just saw a lot of um uh principals driving big fabulous cars and 

Recording: (3771/ 9621) 
my dad act for time and being its not gonna be able to eat it of course i have beaten it you know 

Recording: (3772/ 9621)

Recording: (3774/ 9621)

Recording: (3776/ 9621) 
oh yes i did but <laugh> 

Recording: (3777/ 9621) 
and uh i do not know i think having just having the word honors gives it some kids enough prestige they do not totally freak about it i am not going i deal <laugh> 

Recording: (3778/ 9621) 
boy i do not know i am thinking you know the the divorce people i know had children in involved and uh boy it always seems to me by the time they get to that step it is already you know they have already been to counseling they have already tried a lot of other things and that they are i do not know whether some kind of court ordered thinking about it <laugh> can be thinking we would uh 

Recording: (3779/ 9621) 
that is true book for him well i think it is in the or you are like reading magazine did you know what this guy did you know look at a have to do you know this guy did 

Recording: (3780/ 9621) 
and it is really sort of interesting 

Recording: (3781/ 9621) 
yeah <laugh> and then but you you know i mean that that is that is <laugh> 

Recording: (3782/ 9621) 
oh well 

Recording: (3783/ 9621) 
and uh eventually he he was all right with it he got used to it 

Recording: (3784/ 9621) 
a lot of them they do not want any but they will not want anything different that is all they want 

Recording: (3785/ 9621) 
but uh you know i knew that uh they had already made that from us and there is a lot of businesses that could move out of that area you know and half of those taxes come to columbus even if the business is in west orville half the tax the employees tax went to um west end of the half or coming to columbus 

Recording: (3786/ 9621) 
gun boxuries and picking break in anything uh but when i was a kid too we used to go out to turkey shoots and i would go hunting all the time so i was pretty familiar what in fact hewett guns my kid uh he grew up he was familiar with guns but he all of a sudden you know they touch him 

Recording: (3787/ 9621)

Recording: (3788/ 9621) 
i am trying to work on my license for skayaving though um-hum 

Recording: (3789/ 9621) 
that you would need uh like in the old days you know to melt metal they used uh air dumping it through 

Recording: (3790/ 9621) 
not not yet not i mean he he will pull himself up on to have a different he will like turn around like hey 

Recording: (3791/ 9621) 
yeah i i hope to uh met forty nine you know i i have learned a heck of a lot uh lot of things i would not want to know you know but so i think uh i think uh they have been for a good as long as they he turn them around them then they come upon the sentencing for you but that is why they are all right to have uh uh a book store just like down around campus you know people can come in and go there and relax you know and um-hum 

Recording: (3792/ 9621) 
well uh when i came uh back from oregon my father was very ill and so i did not want full time work and i started substituting out in uh in which paid terribly low there is all these little districts that have uh super and ten it well no they have two elementaries one middle school and one high school and a super and ten that which they do not need you know so they are hard straight out of college choice and they are they are it is a law they uh you have to pay for your accumulated time so i could not get a job out there because i had about six years experience they had to pay me four so i came i am back into columbus and it is a lot harder to work in columbus public but but uh i i know that territory i know where i am going <laugh> 

Recording: (3793/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3794/ 9621) 
well basically it is the same thing here but some of your management is real good i have seen people that that you know are super but i have seen people that are bad the problem is you get a bad management and it can make your life hell i do not care who you are 

Recording: (3795/ 9621) 
um so he he is learning about the computer now and it is gonna be kind of a hobby so i have at least it is not a work thing but i know we can do a lot of things for a house 

Recording: (3796/ 9621) 
do you and i hate hearing myself on tape <laugh> 

Recording: (3797/ 9621) 
i you know maybe i am oblivious to things but i mean i mean it seems like there is a lot of worst places 

Recording: (3798/ 9621) 
i do not know i do not know if i could trust them you know 

Recording: (3799/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3800/ 9621)

Recording: (3802/ 9621) 
see it they can they can be dupping them you know seventy seven years old they can not imagine being hurt by them you know 

Recording: (3803/ 9621) 
you know you can not say and now and it is always going to be orange and it is going to be slippery you know i mean language is so much more abstract than math and science so the abstract area is like history and english and reading and literature that is where these kids have their problems because their disability is usually rooted in somewhere in the languages they either can not write can not read can not spell can not do all three or are not very good at any of them once in a while you will see a good speer because he can remember the order in which letters come but he might be a horrible reader in a horrible right or even though he can spell yeah and his comprehension of the words of other kids is age would not be what it should be generally speaking my kids are two to four three years behind 

Recording: (3804/ 9621) 
um-hum his culture it must be it would be on the way of the situation if he had a white cat then they would end their life and they if they would only it is 

Recording: (3805/ 9621) 
no i did not really start out as a teacher i started out as a speech s hearing therapist but they kept giving me these kids that i could not keep them in the chair long enough to do the speech there to be with them so i got interested in the high for activity and so i started taking classes about any kids was eighty h d and stuff and little by little person you know i had my masters in learning disabilities and it was mostly just so i could learn how to keep the kids in their seat long enough to do the speech therapy and then when i found out the so many openingsings and special ed so and then i found out later that speech therapy is a very good background for ld because a lot of these ld the kids have language deficits and language problems they they can not you know like express themselves on paper or they do not process things correctly auburnly so that is the perfect background to work with ld kids i did not know i was doing that at the time but 

Recording: (3806/ 9621) 
sure well that and they like tuesday when we were blessed with the turn of the sense of weather there she came in and i did i was reading a book and i let her out and i let her i can i started reading again and i am looking around and here is mud so it is kind of good in a way because it kind of well you know uh you live here so that big of a deal you know because i know my sister would freak <laugh> i am

um-hum 

Recording: (3808/ 9621) 
well is it it it just communication was not there 

Recording: (3809/ 9621)

Recording: (3938/ 9621)

Recording: (3939/ 9621) 
oh i am i am sure the fact that my parents um my mother tries real it tries really hard but my my father was an alcoholic he was a working alcoholic so they you know he he could drink on the weekends and never miss work et cetera yeah there was no problem and uh um but the biggest problem i mean is the fact that you know i i um i i i have always expected to have some sort of a respect from them and be because they always wanted me to grow up and be independent and thing for myself and so i am exactly what they always said they wanted it is just that they can not handle that and and so when i was in seventh grade and i got a lot in a lot of trouble about on the whole racial thing because uh i remember them in school where i was in med sleep white students 

Recording: (3940/ 9621) 
but you can make them aware if somebody has an adult steps over that line or makes them uncomfortable you know there should be some kind of a uh system to where these girls are the latest bit you know it is enormous it is you know

Recording: (3944/ 9621) 
to tell you the truth the school i went to was that it i mean 

Recording: (3945/ 9621) 
would be would be interested in i mean i mean not just for the kids sakes but would be interested on their own be half in in teaching the child what uh 

Recording: (3946/ 9621) 
he 

Recording: (3947/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (3948/ 9621) 
she was but i admire her more <laugh> because um uh until the moderates get control of the republican party again that is going the bit of litigious test it was just like back in in the sixties and the seventies when the extreme left wing had control of democratic party they would nominationate such people as uh mcgyvering who had you know who i voted for but had no chance of winning over the years i have moderated my hard line left of center liberal stance for more of a moderate middle of the road because it is easier to get that sold to the american public um so uh wild i think door was correct uh i think she uh she shot herself on the foot i do not she would have never gotten the nomination and as long as the party remains the way that it is being controlled by the extreme right wing which is a problem for the republicans they moved they need to move towards the middle which i think forgetable is trying to do uh uh whenever anybody tells me that i go tell them i tell them yes and i am an in uh an indifferent liberal 

Recording: (3949/ 9621) 
and they have met the couple that is going to adopt the baby which seems kind of odd to me but 

Recording: (3950/ 9621)

Recording: (3951/ 9621) 
i keep thinking about that all the time but i am like i want something where i can be off during the summer so i can take my kids and we can go out west or you know because my wife is in the same boat she will retire two years after i do and our kids you know will be young i have five year old and i only have six years to go so we are talking eleven years oh

i have heard it and it has not been as i have heard it from less reputable sources 

Recording: (3955/ 9621) 
okay i think if you are able to cook two back pick up pretty cool you know 

Recording: (3956/ 9621) 
i do not think forcinging fair on somebody if they do not believe in it i do not think that is the right thing to do but 

Recording: (3957/ 9621) 
no because they are going to learn that on their own um i i personally think it at the choice i do not think you are born that way because i i have friends that are homosexual and um you know i do not believe in what they are doing but i do not do everything right every day so i still love them and they are my friends and love them a lot because but i have also known people that were that way and now are homosexual and are much happier and they realized that it was just the choice they made and things like you like that um so it is in today is day and age they are going to learn about it quickly 

Recording: (3958/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3959/ 9621) 
um-hum that is just one of those myths <laugh> i think beds to make people so guilty or something 

Recording: (3960/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3961/ 9621) 
yeah well i think it would be good if it expanded out a little bit more i mean it is smaller compared to most downtown i mean you you know it seems like you just drive through in two minutes and so i do not think it that would hurt anything and then to live there if they made it more affordable that would be nice so

Recording: (4025/ 9621) 
and and she is very determined uh she has said that having this being pregnant and having this baby is made her focus on things a lot differently she does not she does not want to go back to being the way she was before she does not want to go back to the the drugs and the smoking and the drinking

most of them at our site now we have more of a distributed system where we can actually go out and connect others people connect us and then go out and there is a gate way to other places you know we are getting more into that now but that was not easy so easy before either the you know the way it began 

Recording: (4080/ 9621) 
huh 

Recording: (4081/ 9621) 
the parents have so much responsibility but the kid has so much responsibility and then society has so much responsibility so you know what i mean basically all all i have ever seen is well these kids are getting the house they go to the house they find a gun then they want to hold the parents responsible yes and no on that if the parents had the gun in in the house they had uh ammunition locked up say in the trunk of the car one of the kid bought the ammunition from somewhere else and picked the gunlock off the gun 

Recording: (4082/ 9621) 
or i got a drive you know further north so there is not any like really good businesses right around where i love that is the only thing so i think they need to come in you know you know get the downtown going when i was a kid i would love to go to downtown

Recording: (4085/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4086/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4087/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4088/ 9621) 
like a little fapoo is 

Recording: (4089/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (4090/ 9621) 
they were all around the same age you know and going to college hum i am sorry you are on the phone in just doing that i am just doing the phone okay you are on the phone okay you are on the phone okay you are on the phone oh my daughter julie does uh is very active though and uh not necessarily that she has adopted to her two children so she is become very active in the adoption procedure in tulsa and uh 

Recording: (4091/ 9621) 
but our belief is that it did not it it needed to be restored and we believe um i do not know if you have heard about jose smith or 

Recording: (4092/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4093/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4094/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4095/ 9621) 
that would be fine but again i do not it is just another person with a different life style it is like they are they are they are just seam as me it is just 

Recording: (4096/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4097/ 9621) 
no i just uh basically got out of a a a relationship it was like a rebound type thing uh i was in a relationship for like three years and uh he was cheating on me and so i felt really bad and why did you pick her in the the and then i met this guy who seemed wonderful and then turned out to be not so wonderful 

Recording: (4098/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4099/ 9621) 
uh and work the fourth 

Recording: (4100/ 9621) 
they should have on the news most people keep the house five to seven years before they still wanna move on 

Recording: (4101/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4102/ 9621) 
uh i would either go back in uh languages or actually i am a psychology undergraduate so <laugh> yeah 

Recording: (4103/ 9621) 
because like i think it is archy griffin that went to a really crummy school in in in columbus and to me no matter how bad of an area you live in and about bad school you think you are going to if you want to do it you can because that and really in public schools if you have a learning disability or you know that if you have problems reading or you have problems at home there is a psychologist or a tutor or something to help you and and in uh like worthinton in west ofville to upland you know they do not have the money to threw away in like ethnic schools they do not have the money to put on those programs so some of those people kind of get pushed aside and so you know as you can see i am staying my soapbox i do like coming to the soapbox school oh but you know i i i hate when people say you know look at these test scores because it really does not reflect what is there because it is like saying all kids carry guns to school they do not you no uh the media says well what has there been like maybe five or six people who have taken onto school and killed people what about the uh millions and millions of kids that go to school everyday do their homework and you know do community service and stuff well oh it is just too boring they do not want to hear that stuff you know like that that irritates me um-hum 

Recording: (4104/ 9621) 
yeah we have done a lot of searching when we bought our house and it is hard to find what you want in the house and get the school system too you get into arlington you get in gour back story and the price range we were in you were gonna have to dump fifty thousand into the house it is just uh get them up you know we had a list of what we wanted in a house and our house was only seventeen years old when we bought it but it had had everything we wanted fire place off drive basically you know two and a half car garages you know all the stuff that we wanted when a lot of the older houses went basement it is garages down right you know the lot bots were packed so we live on a golf course and have a creek in the backyard and so it is really yeah they do not yeah they play in the creek i do not play golf yet but oh he is um he is um he is um you know they do not even wanna put it in the air 

Recording: (4105/ 9621) 
i do not know you know climates and foots hundred with golf courses and my parents all through growing up they played golf and i really was interested in it um i just think enough to up though i yeah uh there is so many but 

Recording: (4106/ 9621) 
i mean you could cut paper with this kind of rain <laugh> it is just coming down all over the place hale and lightning 

Recording: (4107/ 9621) 
yeah i take organic i have to take um biology chemistry physics and then um i have to complete a major if it is i do not i meant see twenty nine hours of it 

Recording: (4108/ 9621)

Recording: (4109/ 9621) 
she has now she has it right since my sister megan was born in a megan i twenty so she but the thing is i have got another i have got a a sister my sister bagin um joe is my brother he is fifteen and a half and then i have a sister van sierra who is twelve 

Recording: (4110/ 9621) 
a cleanest position on it well he sort of backed down from what it was going to be and then just hope that it would drop and i mean it went which you are hearing again is that everybody has not changed much uh and that but again that is i think part of that too is society is not ready is some level to accept but in case in the military it is one thing but then people are talking about getting rid of each person 

Recording: (4111/ 9621) 
three 

Recording: (4112/ 9621) 
as of the mass people you got to find out and figure out what needs they are going to roll into like when they get older you know you get into the wheel chair companies or something so it is just going to be massive 

Recording: (4113/ 9621) 
probably a little bit 

Recording: (4114/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4115/ 9621) 
and and what they say that we have done to the language and everything else and and you are not a typical american but you know and then the next hour and a half they just say how had americans are and you kind of think like well thanks for the execution but you still have been insulted me for an hour now 

Recording: (4116/ 9621) 
yeah well it is gotten a lot worse uh when i say a lot worse because if you know you say you do not have kids i have got a kid twenty three years old and it was in the place for him to play 

Recording: (4117/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (4118/ 9621) 
well and it is not just in the schools it is in society uh the environment seems to be an answer to a lot of things and uh it is yeah i just can not it it is hard to imagine that there is an easy fix or there is a fix i do not know it is kind of frustrating because you can not point to one the thing is say this is what needs to be fixed again this pervasive uh it is like the i do not know if you heard about this in the news a woman too even around me in an argument one a one of them set aside at the other one 

Recording: (4119/ 9621) 
did he really 

Recording: (4120/ 9621) 
oh okay i thought well my you mean because like some 

Recording: (4121/ 9621) 
he uh told he never said much about it except he told about one time when he was in uh hospital up in japan after he was burned he said that he is not uh warred with a bunch of other burden patients and and he said uh some of them an human coulded were able to get up and walk around so the and i can see the philosophy the meddys had the guys that could walk help wait on the guys that work mid ground and uh he was had been helping one guy that was pretty bad off in this guy passed way did not make it and so they it is hard to put on and get on to do something else while some of the other guys i am sure of them do not working any more with them he told him and it is where yes you are what are you going to do send me back over to vietnam <laugh> but they sent him home but he was he he was uh not a very enthusiastic exposure i do not think at any time and especially after he came home um-hum 

Recording: (4122/ 9621) 
and that was very stressful 

Recording: (4123/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4124/ 9621) 
and so but certainly after he was held enough to go back to work they were married 

Recording: (4125/ 9621) 
um yeah 

Recording: (4126/ 9621)

Recording: (4127/ 9621)

Recording: (4206/ 9621) 
bye 

Recording: (4207/ 9621) 
i was going to be able to relate to a comment that she made about i believe in the electric chair i believe in uh capital punishment uh but that was one comment she was talking about but then on the very very opposite extreme uh extreme opposite we talked about the love of the child from the day of birth and this may seem to be contradictory and i am not quite sure how to dress that because in and it is um some people would say now wait a minute you are talking out of that both sides of your mouth that especially is how can you say over here you must have the love of this child in your arms and and then over here you are saying you believe in capital punishment and electric yeah 

Recording: (4208/ 9621) 
i think example is probably the best uh they see that you care and they learn to care i think my son john he is the youngest i think he is a very compassionateated school uh very spiritual young man uh more so than his brother that is and they always have to tap away that you know they say that sometimes you give because it makes you you feel better better to give and i sometime try to weigh that if that is part of why i i can not believe it is an attention getting attention for the work you do but uh but maybe just within maybe one feels uh and i think i think it it is a matter of being conscientious to you know conscientious that there are 

Recording: (4209/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (4210/ 9621) 
uh it is quite possible but we picked the day care that i thought was close to well the one that was open that had the closest value so we had uh um oh personally would like a church base program but there are not any well there were not any open when we were looking for one um we did have the option of going here to always you to their day care and it has a wonderful reputation and everybody that i have talked to that has had children there is very pleased with the program but what i did and like was so that they were not um imparting values on the children they do not celebration any holidays at all so they just kind of ignore everything where he is now i still like getting my mother is day card and i mean they are doing trick or treat thing on thursday they are going to the door they get a dress up or he would not have gotten any of that that always you and they are pros and cons to to both of those but

and getting back to the profality and stuff that was another one was in the favor some of the parents are not leading the children right and it was about this mother and father was doing something almost they are little kids maybe six or seven rate walked in there and said what the h you done four letter words is this four and the father is standing looks at the front end after the kid is water out off says a matter of fact where in the east do they all learn to talk like that these things came so away right away see see it is the ones it is the ones that are teaching the kids and it it is all those things that i have mentioned before but i think that really goes back to that and what can we do to change it i think as i said it basically everybody has to learn to think of the other person and what is good for everybody for money not just me me me 

Recording: (4217/ 9621)

i have become visual decentized to like the violence that i see in movies and on tv but i still see a distinct difference between that and real violence um i mean in studying history i am exposed to a number of like rather worse events in history that still are very i still find disturbing um and also hang out in little life bars and every once in a while they will be a fight and it it still i i mean it still is disturbing to me i i i have a distinct difference in my that between reality and fiction and maybe kids like are not making that at that distinctions but i i do not think so and i think if if someone is not making that distant it is i do not know that that they are not uh i i do not know i do not have any evidence to uh to support it i just know that i have it i feel that i have it distinct they just uh very clear distinction between what is uh back in what is fiction what is true the way it is a big way and uh to me i do not think that television has affected me in that way um i mean one of way that like television has affected me is i am full of media references when i speak you know when i am hanging out with friends so and mentioned is a a subject and i am like hey simpsons made fun of that you know at some point uh that is the effecting season i mean i do not think that is too big and in fact people are always used to you know like quote used to be or something i guess that is ten times more elevator so to like oh but uh references to shakes spiel line or something but i mean it it is a part of our culture and i am a part of it and

and i think probably eighty four 

Recording: (4372/ 9621) 
i uh group into is this is this registering it slipped since i 

Recording: (4373/ 9621) 
at the way of the year you know it would be great if somebody you know they would want to pump all this money into it but unfortunately whatever the government puts money into the area you know that tends to be like a uh foreign country gets it you know in 

Recording: (4374/ 9621) 
yeah i figure right now i might as well take advantage of it 

Recording: (4375/ 9621) 
um i would say it does not really matter either way honestly i mean in fact the matters they are so deal with it i mean get over it i mean 

Recording: (4376/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4377/ 9621) 
yeah teach one person one thing and not teach the other person that kind of let me see here give you an example there is a the school that they showed on twenty twenty somewhere out west i believe it is nevada or somewhere and they said that these uh teachers have the highest rating among many other teachers in the nation because of they are actual sitting down the hands on were seeking these children like uh ex girlfriend of mine she was pretty much i would not put her border line in a literate but she did not know how to read or write 

Recording: (4378/ 9621) 
a could i could it might take me a uh a year or two

caring could seal up in their little slot you know in the arm 

Recording: (4384/ 9621)

Recording: (4385/ 9621) 
something to think about 

Recording: (4386/ 9621) 
yeah it just but i can not understand is some people live in up for arlington and some of them get to private school

Recording: (4403/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (4404/ 9621) 
yeah that is kind of subjective although there is a paper that we hand talk to our kids that tells exactly what is supposed to be in every part of the process like the the first the irreography paragraphs is supposed to consist a reader is attention it is supposed to supply background information it is supposed to stay state of your thesis statement which tells mainly what the paper is going to be about and then you are supposed to end the fairly i by listening three ideas about your thesis that you are going to to develop in figure after that too three and four so i mean it is

Recording: (4446/ 9621) 
again with the news with uh um different bombings and uh i think the jewish school caught my attention and now that he is in day care i mean we did a pretty good screening but he still always kind of wondering what is going on he is done quite well he is i mean he learned at his so he is always out of color he is socially learning how to play with other kids those raw things he was not doing home potty training it is been a big deal because all the other kids in class are doing it and

Recording: (4451/ 9621) 
anyway and uh i am not saying in general but with the experiences that i have had um certain families where they do not uh socioe economically just not as well off yeah 

Recording: (4452/ 9621)

Recording: (4474/ 9621) 
for people to read i think there is enough other resources out there if somebody is interested in getting that kind of information that they can do that um i know for for me just because i have so many the younger brothers and sisters and and my family <laugh> and everything i know how i have got some some some pretty what i feel are pretty good opinions about how to handle different things and i knew that my mom always concerns me you know like my sister you know she is kind of the being in front which have been asked so and she she just goes almost creepy she is still bright i mean she really is i mean it is one of those things where she just does not turn in her stuff you know and it is she is twelve

Recording: (4581/ 9621) 
mothers he used to be a principal of mine in elementary school so uh he is like i i think we should talk i was like okay great because i do not like uh boy you are way too serious okay so i know we knew at the time the laws were coming to the door so i i um at this point i um point out that the paper that i went downstairs for i do not know where that is i never found it never saw it never it it is anyway not relevant at all of the story but it bugs me every time i told the story because it does not exist anyway so now we come back inside and it is like well i have got some bad news and my sister is like what yeah oh okay go ahead and he is like no i i think your should sit down huh oh my god all right

Recording: (4585/ 9621) 
i used to when i was driving though uh especially when i was going through the uh going to two seventy things you know that people flip me off and stuff like that i had a funny thing one time a guy is flipping me off because he was going slow and uh i do not know i will test off about him running around him and everything you know and i go to the work pointed to ask some chemical and it pulls in beside me but then i look already and it looks at me like oh you know they 

Recording: (4586/ 9621) 
yeah it is supposed to be an alternative type to the public schools where they can hopefully get a little bit more of the discipline that they may have not 

Recording: (4587/ 9621) 
i think more what they need to do is restrict or uh just make stiffer penalties to people that carry the guns or that are involved buburb shootings and things like that um because i mean in the most part i mean people really do not get too badly punished for things i mean if you look at other countries i mean like people like the asian countries places like that i mean they have really strict laws i mean if you even get caught for like vandalism you still serving jail time and you get you get pretty badly punished for it i mean some cases they even change you up and beat you in public for it um i think not to sound too ventual but i think if more things went that way that there would be a much less problem with it uh i think just the fact that the jails are so overcrowded i do not know that they know that they can get good time in parole and all sorts of stuff that if you shoot someone you are you are not even going to get thirty days in jail and you can be you can like oh i mean that is an awfully small price to pay for 

Recording: (4588/ 9621) 
i am just more of a conservative person i mean i am not sure exactly what his platform is but i have seen him speak a couple of times and i do not know he just impresses me more than al gore

Recording: (4590/ 9621) 
man it was rough 

Recording: (4591/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4592/ 9621) 
that is probably what i do i ignore to them till like august starts are just lying and starts paying attention 

Recording: (4593/ 9621) 
i mean there is always been the nerves and uh i do not know when i was growing up in the seventies there really was not punk or anything like that and i think uh unfortunately i mean there is always going to be all different kinds of people to make the world but it they have just pushed it to an extreme certain kinds of kids and you know they want to i saw you know i watch all these shows day line and 2020 all those reforming on shows and how one was in texas run over one of the punk was run over by uh um a jog 

Recording: (4594/ 9621) 
and decided to pursue the matter to the extent of marriage so that is where they meant no huhuh i i come down here two or three times like you know just trips through going to the airport and other miscellaneous things but um when i moved to the city i mean it it was a real big change because i you know used to living in the country and then i am moving to smackab and the middle of the downtown area 

Recording: (4595/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4596/ 9621)

it is that is weird <laugh> 

Recording: (4598/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4599/ 9621) 
well i mean to me the whole thing is wrong regardless of if you are guilty or innocent to me there is worse than worse things i would think than than dying you know the you you like i know an just the guy who kills etsacrobeen he got locked up and he is not allowed to see it because it um under jewish law you can not kill 

Recording: (4600/ 9621) 
and i have a wife been married thirteen years have two kids age five and seven both of them one is in second grade and the other one is still in day care at oh high state university 

Recording: (4601/ 9621) 
right and if he if he is open minded enough to do it eventually he will see the light and say well this is making it a lot easier but there are people who are like i will not do this so so those are the ones that have to be drug screaming and kicking 

Recording: (4602/ 9621) 
it is salt water fish 

Recording: (4603/ 9621) 
um i mean at that point i i certainly did not have any real knowledge about any of the that sort of thing um you know they covered the basics um they did talk about condom is and on a i am in a they i remember we watched a film which everyone was very embarrassed but um i mean i do not really they i they did sometimes i will pack it to the parents because i remember being really upset and i do not want to my mom to talk with me about it 

Recording: (4604/ 9621)

and she run a fork lifting to a pole <laugh> in from <laugh> most of her nose and chipped her two she is a dangerous woman and uh so uh she gets a lot of ticket sometimes as long as she is not getting her yeah so she is not running in the pool but uh and you know we will use them because they do not they normally go to the movie store and just get a movie in break home we do that all not too but 

Recording: (4606/ 9621) 
yeah the same thing you were talking about and uh we were only the third people to live in it and so it needed everything you know and it had gold car now gold back but in those days everything was like golden you know and green it was horrible and uh it was great fun we had we had a lot of fun we we took the back porch and made a part of the k kitchen and had another back porch put on the finished the third floor and added a family room and another bedroom we put an in their ground pool and so i always joke because what i paid for it i know all three times that amount on it 

Recording: (4607/ 9621) 
and the is doing expression of the expression on that phase can be equally effective as the smack of on the bottom uh with a bare hand or a switch or whatever it may be i know the money the most effective penalty for me was my mother uh would uh go out near a tree and she would break a twig uh off and she would smack me across the shoulder and you know it left mark oh but it it sure it hurts i mean it was staying and i understood exactly what was meant now i think i grew up in a been it up being i think a quite successful person and i think my mother had uh uh thirteen of the fifteen children who lived uh all pretty doggone dishing kids kids and none of us were injured and none of them were hurt uh and that was a basic method of penalty it it was not something that truly for inured uh now today however uh i suspect my mom could usually be could have been charged with abuse of child abuse goes yet left a mark across my shoulder where is that uh green switch it is always a green switch because uh these old ones they would break you do not want them to break <laugh>

Recording: (4617/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah but but many people especially the kids that young may not know what that really means and may it to be part of the group and part of the you know be cool may go along with it when really they do not like it i do not i have not made up my mind about him whether he is telling the truth or whether he has not or whether who was it 

Recording: (4618/ 9621)

um 

Recording: (4708/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4709/ 9621) 
and come back in 

Recording: (4710/ 9621) 
uh a little bit north of north broadway right along the freeway there but it did not used to be a bad neighborhood but now it is just kind of you get the little kids growing up and doing shit that you know <laugh> you picture yourself going as a child one way or another you know now you throw rocks around and stuff and actually break the window right away <laugh> 

Recording: (4711/ 9621) 
that is true sometimes we have trouble finding enough the oldest or something you know an instrument like that a but they they usually get enough to play a concert sometimes we have to bring in a couple of instrumentalists for less feweralsals so we sort of have stringers i guess you would call them <laugh> yeah we have actually been on b was u also uh radio on music in mid ohio uh our recording last year yeah of beethoven is night on on music in mid ohio <laugh> yeah the beat daughter behind college choir 

Recording: (4712/ 9621) 
well i would i would sit down and talk to her like you know if you want to have sex if you really want to have sex you should get on some kind of birth control 

Recording: (4713/ 9621) 
yeah well like i play i play music and stuff with all my friends i do not know basically just like standard teenage stuff sitting around off the tv and like i do not know just running around or whatever but like um high school is always feel like like you know you put in like a tiny little bit of effort and you get like a beat and that is it and it is good enough i guess 

Recording: (4714/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4715/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4716/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4717/ 9621) 
so from a year again and ended up getting there right after i finished my masters 

Recording: (4718/ 9621) 
not yet <laugh> 

Recording: (4719/ 9621) 
during school but at the same time i mean as long as the parents love the kids it does not really matter what sex they are and they treat them well um so i mean that is kind of a tough question to answer i mean it is almost it is something that they almost need to ask the kids but obviously at the age i am just going to be adopting them they obviously would not know how to answer that question yeah 

Recording: (4720/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4721/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4722/ 9621) 
bustbader got there she started out somewhere 

Recording: (4723/ 9621) 
yeah yeah she probably got uh i do not know maybe even she sold drugs or you know whatever kind of way she made her money but it would not have been enough welfare wise to get a car in 

Recording: (4724/ 9621) 
but it is mind boggling that is because i came from a small community there were only two hundred people in my senior class and you knew everybody and now you are talking to whole high schools two football teams you know it is just mind boggling all these people you know you graduate with you know and know a half a half of people and do not know anybody else you know a lot more of uh tightening group as a child so we had three elementary schools and one high school and that was it 

Recording: (4725/ 9621) 
because considerable they wanted uh what was it a two dollar raise or something but and then they also get free tuition but only as i understand it only of very small percentage get that free tuition or like 

Recording: (4726/ 9621) 
well but see i think if you really try to tell kids and especially women that you know you should sex is something that should be between two people that love each other and unless you really feel love and really think it is loved and you know you should not do it 

Recording: (4727/ 9621) 
right well let me ask you uh about somebody else he is not that well know do you know john cork uh have you heard of him he is really worth looking into two he is he is funny he has good songs he is a folks singer really uh along the lines of uh maybe our little got three or somebody i mean he he does electric sometimes but he also does it too thick and um he writes most of his own songs yeah and that if you ever see something by him you should get it or if you see it in a friend is collection they ask to listen to it it is funny funny some of the songs that really funny and some of them are the saddledings you have ever heard yeah yeah <laugh> just just tragic things <laugh> uh let us see funny ones or examples of funny ones are winter cows <laugh> um let us see uh oh i can not think too much of them right now but uh yeah 

Recording: (4728/ 9621) 
but just that freedom you know to do what you want to get some sleep to eat take care of yourself to do a little investigation on your own to pray about it what night and then and it is really clear but if you do not get that and you are always thrused back into it i do not think you can break free 

Recording: (4729/ 9621) 
i think 

Recording: (4730/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4731/ 9621) 
they have just gotten a lot worse like um my niece they my sister have moved in with me for a little bit when her husband was down problem then my niece is eight well she was in fifth grade and there is elementary school that we went to when we are kids and she just said they were bursing smoking cigarettes and everything and i just some like oh my gosh 

Recording: (4732/ 9621) 
all of creation into religion all of what spirituality is into one word religion you you can not um but when you say it is a spirit of spiritual nature that is you know that is still leaving the door wide open that it is it is abroad it is bigger than you ever may uh but that uh that whole the people that they did not have a specific instructions of how to do things and i am not saying they were perfect either there are a lot of indians people and there are a lot of indians people out there that are crook it as adults on the light it is just the way it is they are corrupt the money is corrupt and the lack of money is corrupt to them power has cropped them uh they want to be a spiritual leader why i do not know um uh to me it is an ego thing and uh this rain bookie the guy had some kind of buffalo uh uh what did he call it a buffalo oh saramony they charge everybody they people do not do that i mean just you know native people that you you do not charge people that want to come learn about god there is some people in california that say certain be where our their thing and they bury a woman in the ground with a straw daughter was some ritual of proving and overcoming fear yet the lady was an asthmatic and she was bustrofoam in lost the straw in her mouth and he could not breath and brief and all this hand and died and so the first thing they put in the paper is that another needed uh spirit of how native american spiritualities should be outlawed and if you look at any kind of uh spiritually religion that is out there native americans all they ones that have legislation actually saying what you can and can not have that there is blood quantum saying that if you have a fourth or half 

Recording: (4733/ 9621) 
the local one is more than anything uh 

Recording: (4734/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (4735/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (4736/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4737/ 9621)

but he just did not have a very high opinion of the ori 

Recording: (4746/ 9621) 
everybody is 

Recording: (4747/ 9621) 
so um it seems the picture is kind of hard to deal with people that are in to capitalism have a pretty good lives and they have what they want and they do not seem to have such serious problems of people who try to go against that currentism has made the united states go i mean it just worked uh and we are ahead of the world there is no question about that in what the individual people persons have and how their lives go much better on the other hand um you know i am i am actually well i would like for uh if it would just spread all over the world true communism 

Recording: (4748/ 9621)

Recording: (4753/ 9621) 
he had a variety uh eighth grade is when is probably in some ways his better year uh he was taking a had taken computer class for grade the teaching period and uh it was not going while they were teaching keyboard any more he learned that when he was in third grade so we were talking to the teacher i says well he is disruptive he is supposed to be doing keyboarding exercises and he is writing programs so it was and he said i knew the first reason he knew every thing that i was going to teach this going to for any period while that kind of flew up a red fly to me and he said can you give him other assignments i do not know he is going to do whatever else is doing so we went to the principal and i was president of the the parents advisory committee at the time so my easy access to the principal he took them out of the class immediately put him in the library the library and worked with him one on one teaching data base and spreadsheet at applications to him but then if he had another they are teaching in the ninth grade who contacts us this english teacher and he he is it is told us to say he does everything i will not teach so i want your permission she did she he was using reading books like invisible man by all of them element ellison ralph ellison and element i guess it is anyway um and writing papers on he is reading like three books by an author named trying to write short strain the author is style and she still tested him with the other kids just to be sure she had not missed he had not missed anything and she he was using her grad school in the store to write papers and stuff like this and uh it was he loved it and that is what he needed but we got to high school and we would talk to teachers about this and no they could not do that uh it was very frustrated it is frightening 

Recording: (4754/ 9621) 
or american literature or you know anything you know 

Recording: (4755/ 9621)

Recording: (4756/ 9621) 
probably going to write them again you know and uh then a lot of them i do not think are capable while in their present condition i know like that part of mine i am talking about there is no way in how they get on down the job 

Recording: (4757/ 9621) 
yeah it is great you know and they like it they say so long they you know interact with other kids and learn to use the library you know nowadays you know people do not i do not go to the library as much either on the get your information off the other night or you buy books or you know you you know so i just we have felt that if we did not even interview some now that hopefully this will lead on later and this way you can monitor their television we let them run a couple of luby is here and there but we see what they rent or you know take out compared to you know the cartoon network and all these great you know just cartoons just seems worthless nowadays but actually you watch some of the older cartoons that we watched and they seem more violent than some of the new ones you know daffy dunk in the road around or at least i have seen all boy one of them would kill the folks you know they they just so we are just like wow we we do not know if we wanna let them watch that either so yeah they run and disney and disney is pretty strong i mean you know you think of disney and you think of kids which is still a lot of the stuff they put out this pretty hard core for five here a lot of the dinosaurs and all kinds of stuff it is it is a violent nature so but you got to if you balance that i think you will be all right oh yeah absolutely yeah it is tough sometimes <laugh> to read the paper <laugh> yeah that is like this five year old is addicted to the taurus a and he likes taurus a and movie that was out so yeah he wants to <laugh> i would be kind of boy coming in the daughter would not throw it away <laugh> never do not have to watch that again 

Recording: (4758/ 9621) 
and it she is kind of big test that she is my height but the baby is like oh under and you do not see it i mean unless you push your shirt down 

Recording: (4759/ 9621) 
but they just do not get any of that 

Recording: (4760/ 9621) 
uh i plan at this point to pursue history to the phd level uh anything of course can happen 

Recording: (4761/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (4762/ 9621) 
well i know but you know it it struck me as funny at the time because that is the way it was worded <laugh> 

Recording: (4763/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (4764/ 9621) 
um yeah well it was like i kind of just like stopped going to class and and like and then i just like ended up with john because i would of like failed everything anyway so but um and i was living with my friend for a while um but and then like you know i no mean her and my other friend live in down meanered 

Recording: (4765/ 9621) 
so you are 

Recording: (4766/ 9621) 
you have to go to dances you have to do that whole thing so i really do not know how how how they would go about doing that perhaps like i know we used to have like uh we had like the administrators actually allowed us to have uh a day where everyone like the whole class as a class could go have a picnic like in the practice football field and that was cool because everyone got along those days because you did not have to go to class you know you spend it in the second half of the day just hanging out so everyone got along that way and i think that would be a start you know but then that helps the the the administrators in the sense that they are they are providing education so it would be rough and like my high school they they put up cameras and they had like they locked bathrooms like at certain times you could not go in on and they it was getting and they had like we had like we were on the front page of the act and we could in turnal because they had a lock down where no one was allowed to leave their classroom and then they brought this the dog is threw and they found i was surprised they found a lot of trouble bugs 

Recording: (4767/ 9621) 
they prevent it from doing much yeah yeah i just do not think that they can do much and i i am sure it is very frustrating for them well and and i know it is i uh we have a friend who is was a teacher she just retired a couple of years ago she went to our age and uh it seems very different though uh you know it is she said it is scary going into the classroom sometimes uh and before it was not that you knew that if you had a problem you could make a you know go and get something down with it now you can not get backing on it 

Recording: (4768/ 9621) 
so he would not have to pay for it 

Recording: (4769/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (4770/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4771/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4772/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4773/ 9621) 
oh exactly i am planning on just staying in the house if i can or what night yeah oh yeah yeah i know i mean we are going to get some water in what night because you do not know people like you said 

Recording: (4774/ 9621) 
i wish they could work on tech 

Recording: (4775/ 9621) 
yeah and and never got any better then they got in marching band and they run that for four years and sometimes we noticed they march and sometimes they did not because they did not learn their music but they stayed with it and they said then they like volunteer down at coast to eye they did not get paid a dime for this but they did it because they enjoyed helping and definitely it is like they go we want that over there said you as a straight a student have proved nothing to us and you over there as a b student have proved that by gosh you know you will try out for something and if you do not do well you go but i like doing it and i am going to keep with it you know and to me the straight a students who does nothing it is like the kids who go to school and shoot people they have nothing in their right at all and the other one has you know activities and they are giving themselves to the community you know you know like my both my daughters have like volunteered for the library a reading program and then they went on and they volunteer at coast eye and and my oldest one was in key club and they would have like easter egg hunts for that school is uh green school and it is a tax to columbus alternative high school so uh you know i i read them um a uh resume that she put in for a scholarship and it was explaining how the the closest she got to crying at school was when she would uh do these projects because she says there were kids there that she knew had no easter candy and it was just they were just so excited that the kids went out and bought like a dollar or two so it was like a candy and hit it out and they would have an easter egg hunt for them at school and she says you know those are the things that were important to her and you know to me that makes you feel like you are worth something but the kids that go you know the ones that went to school i you know i do not see any community service or i do not know about i i am not a big gunwho have to be religious person i mean i i feel i am a christian but i am not a church goer and i do not think you have to go there to be a religious person you know but uh you know i think religion and community service and feeling like you have given something to the community and you know you are just not asking continuously for uh and and trying things and feeling at them and going okay well but i still like to play basketball i am terrible but i like to play and i can not make the teams so what do i do i know i will go to the y and play there you know that that is what keeps kids out of trouble and those that go to school and come home and either sit on the computer and you know uh do the check room stuff or the eat mail stuff or sit around the a playing with video games i think those are the big problem in children because that you know mom and dad go how can and i get them to do something instead of my hair oh i know i will buy them and then tend to i will buy them this they get i will buy them this look they are out of my way you know because you know 

Recording: (4776/ 9621) 
oh yeah fine now i comes back to your statement what do they tell us we need well now what you need you need a refrigerator you need frost free you need all these things and you know what you go down the street see them at garage sales you have and then you ask people why did you buy them oh we thought we needed them

Recording: (4879/ 9621) 
some of the really hard questions um why are bad things happening to good people people can not people can not just accept that that bad thing just happening to good people they want to know why i am not i mean yeah i have a personal relationship with my with my god but we are not on you know we are not on on a conversation you know i am on the side of the table you are on the that so the table why did this happen he he does not see fit to tell me why something happens unless it pertains to me um um see it was another really hard one um is the is um apologetic uh for apologetic which is going out and saying your sender except price everybody on this campus is sort of brother jet he runs around on he runs around on the other end of the you know flat horror and got a idea a and that is just you know i mean there are a lot of there are a lot of people within the community of of christians who can not stand that and we do not like what he is doing because yeah i am one of them because we have to go back anyone who has been influenced by him we have to go back and we have undue all the damage he is done before we can really start in on them and and and helping them to understand what we are trying to tell them we have to undo what brother jetet has done because he he is just i mean yeah maybe his heart is in the right place but he is doing it the wrong way but uh one of the big things is right after we are done doing all of the spiel about you know why you think they should accept price in their life they say okay that is good for you and and that is the general that is the general feeling among people our age our generation i mean which generation or i mean anyways i am i am in i am twenty so there is like the generation x they are the generation right after me and then there is generation y two k they are generation right before me so we are stuck right in the middle i do not even think we have generation

Recording: (4891/ 9621) 
uh well the problem is is uh like say every airline wants to go to new york city and they want all their businessmen there at a m well an airport has so many runways and so many tax you ways and you know like say ten airplanes every ten minutes can come in and out of those airport well they end up shooting like thirty there so instead of letting them all get in the air and stay up there on hold while they are you know shooting them in what they do is they like uh say a going to over here they will you have to call for release times to these different airport and they will say well he can not go right now but he can go like it twenty seven passes they are so he they know oh by looking at the entire picture of how many airplanes are coming to that airport when he will fit in so it is not so much air traffic delays it is airlines that cause it to himself it is like uh you and i and five hundred people want to get to this room uh ten oclock today well rather than say why do not some of you come at ten and another group come at ten fifteen and another group and then we are all trying to do the same thing at once and it does not work you know you you can not get you can not get so many people through that door and if you say well i am going to take five of it at time well they can get in but if you say i am taking five hundred at time it does not work and so the airplane airlines always go well it is the government in regulations and above so that is why we are delayed and it is really them themselves because they are

Recording: (4972/ 9621) 
so you know down there there is five different sector so they split the uh area up into five different areas and uh you know there are some sector down there that get extremely busy see and then sometimes it is just like you know your twirling your thumb it it is like useder from it you know it is not like steady like if you are working at wire running the cash register it is just kind of like deaddy it is like you look at you know you it would be like sitting at my yard and there is no one in your line and then you turn your back and turn back around and there is like seventy five

Recording: (4981/ 9621) 
um well the opinion kind of like the general consensus around upper arlington is that oh see there is not a good enough school 

Recording: (4982/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4983/ 9621) 
this is there is there is no faulting in it this folks but still there is nothing else to do and there is nothing creative or responsible to say that this experience so you end up with your kidding again and again and you had two individuals you said you are kidding and then and never mind a person they never send back 

Recording: (4984/ 9621)

Recording: (4999/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (5000/ 9621) 
right right well it is sort of a problem as well but you know those i mean i it seems you know from what i have read if you want it to make the bomb is fairly uncomfortableicated you know so 

Recording: (5001/ 9621) 
that is right and in other words it is so much me anymore instead of us and we 

Recording: (5002/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5003/ 9621) 
yeah it does not it is not like a skilled profession to me i 

Recording: (5004/ 9621) 
but see that is because i do not think americans travel as much as as like that the europeans do i think i guess because europeans they have like more i guess public transportation accessible they get the trainings that the world trains and the buses and and and just say the first just by personal car you can go you know across just going across the border you can then go visit uh you know country is like like it is so condense but here it is like we have got our ozians and it is like we have got a like fly so so i i think that is why like i think in europeans i am more i am much more cooler in that respect they they they it is like it is no big deal for like somebody and you have to speak like seven languages my here it is like you know you get somebody over here they used to connect actually who actually loves english <laugh> you know it is like so that that is i think that is i think that is what i will find i oh sweet 

Recording: (5005/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5006/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5007/ 9621) 
yeah i think it is further east and where i went i was right in the year old mountains so it is like the border of europe and isia 

Recording: (5008/ 9621) 
so they are close but i try to avoid seeing them except my grandfather who is uh a nice terribly and everything the others are on nice and sweet and stuff but do not have enough of worth in characteristics to me people have been around to um 

Recording: (5009/ 9621) 
<laugh> it is and it was world war two that brought them together <laugh> um my my dad was uh you know at the end of the war he was an army airport and he never had to go overseas but he was stationed in louisiana 

Recording: (5010/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5011/ 9621) 
not so much old star trek uh i like deep space nine of the new ones um i mean i used it back when it was new i liked the next generation but when deer space nine came out and had a gr itier darker story that was not so cookie cutter in fashion there was uh a greater degree of continueity from episode to episode and more character development it was not like these perfect people on the ship going and facing bad people the the characters themselves that flawss and that costs for better drama so i like that do not like voyager so much i i see that it when it first came out i had high hopes because i saw it the thing that would be even grittyier they they had the potential for for excellent inter character conflict but they gloss over all those and pedly was in the first season uh and that really bothered me and then it ultimately this story you know they are trapped but they do not really pursue like the issues of being separated from home in two factions that had 

Recording: (5012/ 9621) 
they set up on springfield ohio and said my mom met my father um he was from potasco they met here at always she was there going to college and they setled columbus

Recording: (5015/ 9621) 
and i would definitely keep an eye out and you know figure out what is going on you know 

Recording: (5016/ 9621) 
i hang out like i do not know it is more of like a like a suburban town as opposed to like a centralized downtown yeah it is just like um you know like a half an hour i i mean twenty minutes outside and you know you can get to double on or fifteen minutes to double or something like that and i mean that is still like a part of of columbus as opposed to yeah uh so where do you hang to use those around in the office or yeah 

Recording: (5017/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5018/ 9621) 
yeah they have uh book okay they do have sales tax but it is added into the price before see i have seen it they are trying to figure out what it is 

Recording: (5019/ 9621)

Recording: (5020/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5021/ 9621) 
right and you know all the babies in the hospital become under my son is insurance and she is covered under her father is insurance so their medical expenses are not going to be very big 

Recording: (5022/ 9621) 
yeah you go to you go to class in one building and you go across the yard to another and then you get another line and then you come across another you know locker and all that uh she is just like a mini campus 

Recording: (5023/ 9621)

so i do not know she likes it 

Recording: (5025/ 9621) 
yeah man i do not wanna be over in the next county you know driving in the middle of the sky gone huh yeah a couple of people down there floating around under me 

Recording: (5026/ 9621) 
and it is a very it seems to be a fairly conservative uh university as well so 

Recording: (5027/ 9621) 
i mean not that i i do not want to be on welfare it is like it is like it it down when i want to go up you know 

Recording: (5028/ 9621) 
uh actually when i was at a house state i worked for the newspaper 

Recording: (5029/ 9621) 
oh gee that is to me <laugh> 

Recording: (5030/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5031/ 9621) 
but that is because i am not home a lot and like i said my wife is here now her mom is just moved to texas so she is living down to texas and she is got brothers and sisters all over the united states 

Recording: (5032/ 9621) 
um it is probably a bit worse i mean actually just waiting for my last experiment they are a couple of people talking about it they were talking about it 

Recording: (5033/ 9621) 
not this job no 

Recording: (5034/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5035/ 9621) 
right they and that is it they have not had a challenge you need to have a challenge just put to you every day every day because they have more meaningfulness and that so that would you be ahead down the is not uh thankless of what i did uh my gosh i am still coming to you i need more help at tomorrow because with our something intangible there is going to be a motivation factor some of the guy give you a drillin will get up tomorrow morning and say hey i am going to do a better job today than it yesterday but when we as a society say oh gee he struggles i guess they say well let us lower this thing in bought let us sort of bar little more that is what you know gosh start hey <laugh> scooney he did not make that last shot last night and they came out let us get a few more minutes you minute and listen they they are going to shoot you get two more minutes to try it 

Recording: (5036/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5037/ 9621) 
i do not know uh in i do not and for a while we got it stopped the thing that is uh confusing to me is that sometimes we will get something stopped for twenty five or thirty years or ten or fifteen and then we go back just like hey we have got moved ourselves solid that why are we going back to it now uh and and i think you know that papers keep saying that our uh crime rate is going down and everything and so uh i think that is because we some people are you know trying to make it deal with these people as people who are ill or sick and and try to help them with their you you know it took us a long time to figure out that alcoholism is amaz of disease okay and it is so now we try to help alcoholics well uh certainly murdering it 

Recording: (5038/ 9621) 
no this all started along before that actually just recently he seems to have accepted the idea that guess the baby is going to be born right i think he just kind of tried to ignore it for a long time but he is off of your hobbies now uh and she is she is great

Recording: (5097/ 9621) 
right if she could have become the candidate she might have been able to beat i i think almost anybody can be poor right now but you know in in election and times of the weekend is a couple of centuries uh a year is an eon you know so anything could happen between now and then but i think a door had a good chance of being elected because most americans are moderate will go with the moderate candidate uh which is basically where clinton placed himself off in the two elections he ran in uh most real democrats the warren beaties of the world many you know congressmen and and senators just like clinton because they they did not think he was democratic enough uh i like clinton because as i said over the years i have learned that extremes in either party you do not get elected and that if you want someone that has your general interest at heart you have to find someone who is a moderate and can appeal to everybody i used to tell school districts when i went in to tell them how to to put together a school every campaign that basically you had the rule of thirties and that had nothing to do with my age but that there was about thirty percent of the people who are for you with the yes votes thirty percent who are automatically against you the no votes and thirty percent in between i told them at northern no votes you know just just do not get them upset with you you do not want them you know working actively against you lock up your your thirty that are with you and make sure that you know you do something with them but this group the the middle thirties i called them you had amazogdo them and that is what clinton did so well and that is what dole could have done i am not sure if george w is going to be able to uh because to get the the nomination eventually he is going to come out and have to make his hard statements to those people which is i am antiabortion i am pro gun he is already said the pro gun and that going against what most americans are saying door i think represented where most americans are if you look at opinion polls uh um so you know you have to find a way to to moderate that stance uh whether you are a republican or a democrat 

Recording: (5098/ 9621) 
yeah if i had um if i had stayed for the i i did not graduate so if i would stayed for the fourth year uh when we did a lot we would do a lot of um uh uh making up a port fully or that kind of thing uh i probably then i would have started going to interviews and i i would have i probably would have stayed but it was

Recording: (5119/ 9621) 
yeah i think the population uh in a way but i think it also leaves it open for all the things of having too many people in one area uh i do not i do not know i think the main thing that affects me now and since i have been home i have been reading the paper a lot more and you know more aware of what going on and i really am going to be some kind of red for uh i do not know a lot of the places that are coming up the gentleman is clubs and things like that i just i think that is going to be really bad for the kids and and everybody around um there is one off of uh beathel or i know itself of henderson tooth and then there is the red hot peppers or something i saw the other day and i could not even believe they are like right across the street from each other you know and it is funny because you read the paper and and it seems like so many people are concerned about kids and education and all that but then they i think it really affects it yeah try to go around <laugh> and until they make a woman is club so they will not be real equal <laugh> yeah <laugh> 

Recording: (5120/ 9621)

Recording: (5148/ 9621) 
i do not know i mean i was actually looking at that raiser military and they started poping up all this abuse stuff and i was like man darn it right my

Recording: (5169/ 9621) 
because they are they have enough money to buy new things and they do not want to necessarily send it down i do not think to the dedalmatian army or the i i do not know but i think that they think that there is a better way of giving away and like good will they resell in south asia and army they resell well we we

Recording: (5179/ 9621) 
well we believe that uh that regulation that was there on earth was actually restored again in through joe smith because he had is desire and it is hard to know what was true and he prayed and he actually had a vision where he saw god in jesus christ and i know this is all really i mean this is like deep doctor and stuff but and uh and he was told that there were not none of the churches on the earth were true that some of them had good things but they they are um they were not exactly hitting the mark 

Recording: (5180/ 9621) 
i i 

Recording: (5181/ 9621) 
yeah yeah

Recording: (5193/ 9621) 
i i will that is a that is a tough one uh i liked that but they were like to borrow their boys and stuff you know or those put them in the still of the hall the fake anyway you know but and to me that is fake you know uh and i never really thought about while i was growing up as it was what was around and everything i always knew that by i gar again you by my dad being a hunter and everything you know i knew it when you shot something that that died it was not that was not a game you know uh and i would hate to think that would cause some kid to go off his rock or i mean that does not i i do not even know why they should be any concerned for it i guess in the long run 

Recording: (5194/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5195/ 9621) 
yeah i do not think that women should be on the front line uh some women are are physically able to do but you needed some definitely are not of course there is uh same by the same token to talking to some men so it is it is support goopes i think that is all right 

Recording: (5196/ 9621) 
yeah i mean he 

Recording: (5197/ 9621) 
she is very bright she is very she comes from an extremely dysfunctional family her uh parents divorced and she is about four her mother is in alcohol like her father said that he would take her with him and then after it comes to the mind so she is pretty much raised herself it it is a big it it is terrible thing as what she said to go through and she is made it very clear that she will not live with an alcoholic and that is helped straightening him out so and our feeling was never that the alcoholism or the the drugs was not the problem and we dealt with several counselors and that is all they wanted to deal with our crime of always been at the same and took psychologist a year and a half but he finally of course charley is he is very into his and even as a it is on the talkinger he could do this he he seemed to be able to give adults what they needed from here 

Recording: (5198/ 9621) 
that was real close to my home <laugh> 

Recording: (5199/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5200/ 9621) 
but he would bring in nutrients list or whatever to explain to the parents blah blah blah 

Recording: (5201/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5202/ 9621) 
okay so they it seems like an independent contract for them 

Recording: (5203/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5204/ 9621) 
um i think i think through education that is it is just going to only help kids because a lot of times maybe they do not get that at home so they are really looking to choose the right thing to do 

Recording: (5205/ 9621) 
yeah oh my uh i am in this uh venturing crew which is their boy scouts our leader has this like society totally planned out 

Recording: (5206/ 9621)

Recording: (5207/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5208/ 9621) 
crime and stuff uh i mean a lot of it is just a strong economy now that we have started during the republican years in straight over uh but people have been better off financially overall uh so he is many he is major mistakes policy wise well if you say his personal life <laugh> just in his he is yeah yeah <laugh> 

Recording: (5209/ 9621) 
i mean it goes back more towards a curious nature of kids where i mean i can not say there is anything really different 

Recording: (5210/ 9621) 
no that 

Recording: (5211/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5212/ 9621) 
i mean that is not to say that i do not like being catholic or whatever 

Recording: (5213/ 9621) 
uh it is just there we go again who is right and who is wrong i have no idea 

Recording: (5214/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5215/ 9621) 
but you had to you had to work you had to you had to migrant they they started supporting the family up by saying sir if you want a job we are expecting to los angeles we are so they split the family uh

anything else is a hard way failure you need to be fixed somewhere else anyway so if you know how to put an operating system on your machine you can start over if you can start over there is no reason to be scared of anything that you do problem number one in playing with computers for most people is being afraid that they are going to break something 

Recording: (5422/ 9621) 
well i believe me i know 

Recording: (5423/ 9621) 
yeah you can hide a lot of that and get away with it for a long time which you know i am sure she did i do not know i always thought um i always thought it would be neat to have uh system like the police have if you do not pay a speeding to get there is a warrant for your rest and they come after you 

Recording: (5424/ 9621) 
like uh oh from mormons well our basic uh real fundamentalist is that the church that uh russians believe in it one time was the true church and it was um the the same church that craze set up when he was on the earth with the total possibles and but after christ died that the authority was taken from the earth to um have those a possibles and to have the the church set up the way it was and it must have been really strong because it still lasted all the same catholic and and or all there was the doctor is churches still carried all these beliefs 

Recording: (5425/ 9621) 
um no children so it was quite easy for us 

Recording: (5426/ 9621)

Recording: (5428/ 9621) 
and until the consumer becomes on the equal knowledge level as the uh it is always going to be an equitable and you are going to have a problem in our society because we do not need these large houses and so forth because as you progress an age it becomes a liability but then the developer i said well let us see well we can make condos down size let me was just want to make this we want to make this margin of profit yeah we do but what about for society is best interests 

Recording: (5429/ 9621)

yeah when i first went to auburn i was a performance major in the french horn and looking back on it i wished i would maybe thought to major in music education or at least have a little bit of background in that because i am thinking it would have given me a little more dimension in terms of my my teaching possibilities and uh although i am certified to teach now in chemistry and uh nurse science um it might be nice to have the option of teaching music also 

Recording: (5441/ 9621) 
um-hum

Recording: (5453/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5454/ 9621) 
yeah i start early and she starts late so she gets the one daughter on the bus to go to school and then then she can take the boy over to the day care and then they are only there five hours and uh 

Recording: (5455/ 9621) 
yeah and i am close to the ones that that feel the same way i do about things my oldest sister you know i could stay on the phone so long but we have such different opinions about things that yeah i do not stay on very long with her 

Recording: (5456/ 9621)

<laugh> 

Recording: (5459/ 9621) 
there is some kind of tax program 

Recording: (5460/ 9621) 
ah it is kind of like um you go to the private school and you get there maybe seven years old one that is uh fifteen sixteen and at sixteen they can actually determine give you a test and sit down with you and ask you about different things and sixteen fifteen sixteen year old kid actually graduate from college you know being yeah they have they have shut that study already i mean i think it is i think it is amazing yeah i mean when i first heard about it i said uh some doogie how they are hitting you know um-hum but now it is just you know now it is kind of reality you know because i know pretty much a lot of skills the trades i know how to cook pretty much know how to handle myself out in the wilderness <laugh> i mean you know go up on nature hikes and good fishing all that stuff just combined into one it is all about being an individual and if those teachers can not study with that individual know what that individual wants young then older kids are not going to know what to do into practicing well and out like and going to that school for it 

Recording: (5461/ 9621) 
<laugh> but it was interesting uh they did have uh assembleies where they they had religious some beliefs um religion was not uh all in it was not all in the base of in the school but they did have some blesses and uh for religious holidays and that kind of thing and i remember thinking uh it is it is interesting the concept of eating somebody isly in blood <laugh> it is almost cold like <laugh> and i am thinking i am starting to think well what really separation uh a religion from a colt <laugh> and that i think it is just that this social acceptance of it really almost um you know how many people are in it probably a lot of number divisions them i am not really sure <laugh> <laugh> yeah yeah yeah well i i like uh i was i have been very politically actively right sevenies and early eighties i was very active in uh um alternative energy fighting against nuclear power and uh they have been active at various times in animal rights movements and uh political campaigns uh foreign policy kinds of debates that kind of that kind of thing and one thing that i have noticed uh a lot is there a lot of there well there there is a wide spectrum but in the uh there are a lot of liberals in the catholic church too <laugh> you know 

Recording: (5462/ 9621)

mixed and just keep an eye on what is going on 

Recording: (5475/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5476/ 9621) 
but the writing they give you one point for each paragraph so you have to get five points to pass now you might get four out of five and on close by it and then you have to really take that one part 

Recording: (5477/ 9621) 
yeah we uh you have to concentrate on what is important or just flies by and you do not even see it yeah 

Recording: (5478/ 9621) 
and uh the other one is um a uh working cut at the student goahio uh

Recording: (5484/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5485/ 9621) 
the real service now 

Recording: (5486/ 9621) 
well and do not you think too the that the more they have found out psychological speaking about children and the placement of children in the family and the uh throws of not having enough or or being sorely neglected because you were one of so many i mean janet and i both know the that experience from being one of eleven children raised so you know you did not have the advantages that 

Recording: (5487/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5488/ 9621) 
well i did not know if you give them my name or if you can

Recording: (5490/ 9621) 
hm 

Recording: (5491/ 9621) 
which kids 

Recording: (5492/ 9621) 
probably 

Recording: (5493/ 9621) 
i was about to see now on the record off the 

Recording: (5494/ 9621) 
i am from columbus so i uh was born and raised in columbus uh i grew up on the east side of columbus i graduated from high school i have been there for twenty four years 

Recording: (5495/ 9621) 
yeah they are 

Recording: (5496/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5497/ 9621) 
and and that is what a lot of people are telling me you know just you know life just struggle 

Recording: (5498/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5499/ 9621) 
it it was not easy and at first it was probably a lot harder then after you have been there for about six months and you start to just get used to things but i i took for granted coming to amer going back here was 

Recording: (5500/ 9621) 
because you know the sun itself already plays all these adding games and subtracts games and leather games and you know at least the day care all this stuff they had have on their computer as all education stuff it is not game game it it has a game theme to it but 

Recording: (5501/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5502/ 9621) 
i think that uh it would have been better for me if we had lived in new york 

Recording: (5503/ 9621) 
boy it would have to be um something that i actually enjoy um what happened was ever since i came to columbus almost every company i work for was bought out and sold and moved to a different state and i was not interested in that uh because my husband works for the state so obviously he is not going anywhere uh so i got tired that and that is why i kind of went to dumping and stuff so it would be one with a variety um i am unfortunately i say unfortunately good of the counting and stuff but that does not get to express my creative side as much so it would be um my favorite job was one where i did the accounting but i dealt with people as well and like we do presentations at seminar and stuff like that occasionally too so right 

Recording: (5504/ 9621) 
and it is you know my mom is she always says well what should i you know what do you think i should do about this and we always talk about different things so i think i think it is kind of neat that i have been involved in a lot of a lot of the other kids that way 

Recording: (5505/ 9621) 
out of our dad is we had terminal that connected to us this to 

Recording: (5506/ 9621) 
now i just like it anyway and i like their culture a lot 

Recording: (5507/ 9621) 
fruits yeah and it is like what is the difference you know besides the price 

Recording: (5508/ 9621) 
but there are those that are out there that are willing to do that 

Recording: (5509/ 9621) 
you know they should not know where the keys are if they were keys to the gun cabinet or whatever i mean the fact that you know how do you explain your way out of your kids taking guns ines in school 

Recording: (5510/ 9621) 
which was scheduled in the evenings when i was working and i could not even go to therapy 

Recording: (5511/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (5512/ 9621) 
actually it is probably the closest place 

Recording: (5513/ 9621) 
oh okay <laugh> 

Recording: (5514/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (5515/ 9621) 
my boyfriend went love to mess with us i just wanted to know he he take it out of part putting it back together 

Recording: (5516/ 9621) 
according to that and so uh i can not think what some of their observationsations were but they are sort of religious one are two lines of 

Recording: (5517/ 9621) 
she that is a grandmother she lets the kids pretty much you know 

Recording: (5518/ 9621) 
and they go she is got it and they go to the next guy and then all of a sudden you are going off this and they go uh this is nice julia uh where are you going and you are like uh uh he uh told me to and then they go home brother you know so now you know the attention is diverted to use though that is usually what the problem is because most pilots are they are real professional you know um 

Recording: (5519/ 9621) 
i have given you plenty of opinions have not i i have just loaded them on you okay i i just have a question is do is this a research project for or private organization or is it 

Recording: (5520/ 9621) 
you know my parents never did because uh they knew i was always levelheaded i always had a lot of boyfriends you know that i always i always felt like i am just waiting for the right one 

Recording: (5521/ 9621) 
is that right 

Recording: (5522/ 9621) 
i mean instead of a doctor 

Recording: (5523/ 9621) 
humum 

Recording: (5524/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5525/ 9621) 
i can see i have been here twenty five years and i seen a lot of weird stuff the fact is when i was a bigger i seen a manager that had nothing to do for ten years 

Recording: (5526/ 9621) 
from the day one 

Recording: (5527/ 9621) 
he has to but that the more that has primarily because of necessity uh more often than not uh uh maybe even today it is less than that because it is been because of the loss of up parent their children so yes do those things do again and they always have some but that is a very small percentage that has got 

Recording: (5528/ 9621) 
no matter how much money they are giving for their education they 

Recording: (5529/ 9621) 
when you think that our major resource is is our children in our off spring then we better not you know 

Recording: (5530/ 9621) 
uh we are plano moving in the spring 

Recording: (5531/ 9621) 
on number one it is a little bit smaller more controlled area quiet and oh less and uh give them a mom clisters this sister you know my sister lives up there she moved there from uh down in west virginia so you know with mom having on oh the piece of peace and quiet she wants yeah plus in uh place that is only year old 

Recording: (5532/ 9621)

Recording: (5533/ 9621) 
um just to get into the school there is about thirty people applying they let three in 

Recording: (5534/ 9621) 
yeah they could be wrong yeah 

Recording: (5535/ 9621) 
yes to some degree they should but they will go again it is just like the people when i worked in bars they would always want to hold the bargehander responsible but see you could come up i give you a beer and you could give it somebody else 

Recording: (5536/ 9621) 
all the cool apartments are on one sixty one all the great restaurants and everything so that is where i live 

Recording: (5537/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5538/ 9621) 
um well actually it is sort of all happening in a certain area you know with you know very high unemployment like council council states um you know this sort of stereotypes you know kind of bad family environment you know parents have lots of boyfriend and girlfriend drugs everything else and you know a lot of these girls that have been interviewed you know say oh you know i wanted something to love or you know we were bored so we decided to have sex and i mean i find it just totally appalling and you know thirteen year old boy who was interviewed with saying oh you know he would you know slept with like ten girls or something i am thinking oh my gosh you know and he is thirteen and you know had a few kids and that was it but in my opinion the main problem there is they get more port even at that age when they have they you know they get unemployment because once they have had a kid even if they are not of working age they get like at an a certain amount of money and then once they reach i think uh fifteen or sixteen if they have a baby they are provided they are the top of the list for a council house so they get there on there was actually a long document around before i left um you know of this girl who was constantly fighting with her parents and you know our parents were at the end of the there hope she got pregnant and she was like well you know hey this is my ticket to move out because she gets her own place she gets money for herself money for the baby she does not have to pay any utilities or anything and you know one more could she want you know was basically what she was saying i have got my own place i can do whatever right now i am getting money and i do not have to work and and so that i think is a very bad situation because they are almost rewarded for you know um-hum 

Recording: (5539/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5540/ 9621) 
because i add a lot of frustration build up <laugh> get a whole list there

so they do not want toyork 

Recording: (5542/ 9621)

Recording: (5543/ 9621) 
you know and without a health insurance that will cost a few hundred dollars and they have no means to help themselves at least if you assume you are eighteen you could get a job like in try and pay for your health insurance i mean it i am not saying it would be easy but still 

Recording: (5544/ 9621)

Recording: (5602/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (5603/ 9621) 
yeah i i you know i think you know i would apologize to my oldest daughter almost every day about of the poor thing all i put her through one we were trying to grow up together and i was twenty four which was born so i was not a child but it is like you do not have realistic expectations of what what children are capable over what they can do because if they are really verbal and they can it is always have been really horrible because i have talked to them from the moment they were born even you know when they could not talk to me that was their relevant i was talking to them the whole time obviously see i do not i so i would talk to them the whole time and so they would always be really fairable and so it would seem like they had a much better understanding and could do things better than they really could like when my daughter was about five we got a hamster and i said well you know you make sure you give up food and water and when it died and i was so surprised that she had not get and then they have been giving him food and water because she did it occasionally but to a five year old you know yeah they do not get that stuff together our wind she was eleven we sold her bedroom furniture and i gave her the money she could wait to keep so she could wait to buy something else within three or four months it was gone you know and so then the next year and a half she only had a address on the floor in the room because but i mean now they are bizarre now with my other kids first of all i would have better sense than to do those things there i i would take more responsibility rather than expecting them to have it and couldly 

Recording: (5604/ 9621)

Recording: (5738/ 9621) 
like that like salt area but like on the limited south area that does not seem right either but 

Recording: (5739/ 9621) 
hm 

Recording: (5740/ 9621) 
that is parents could pick them up and everybody was annoy my husband said i would not let her stay i do not understand why you are doing this i do not care i wanted to come home the other well the bottom line i was buperical because she and this little boy they are outside and they are jumping and he is jumping on the trampoline and i go out to them and i introduced myself and i say you know honey i said really sorry about the plans but i just you can i just could not let you have got her stay there that long he goes well that is okay my mom would never let me do that so i was not thinking you know here is on everybody is activelyly come the bad guy and i am i am the right and so the i said they were very saying it was funny because um there was something that she wanted to skip a play needless but i would not let her skip because it was for a party that her friends were having i understand it was important to her but when you have commitment you you keep a commitment and so was saying he agreed with me and i said look even your dad thinks that in this case he so what is the reason he is he never has an opinion how come all of a sudden he allowed to have an opinion tell me what i could do you know it was really funny <laugh> we laughed about it and i let her um i let her skimped <laugh> because i decided that it was so important to her 

Recording: (5741/ 9621) 
yeah i mean but i mean uh we are not in a depression and and you know the employment rate is fine and health cares we have got some improvements there and like i said that it is hm you know but i just i mean so i was not saying he is done a a horrible horrible job but i mean i think that you just spend so much time sing on other things and looking at all the money that we wasted the money on something else you know and you end up doing that 

Recording: (5742/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5743/ 9621) 
i think they do well 

Recording: (5744/ 9621) 
is that the way jesus christ would have brought that here well some people have an opinion and they say no no i said you you wear that you do something about that if you do not then i realize what a sponless person you are but you will never find me in your church again so i have done what i have done but and there is a lot of people out there that will read a book on native american spirit of quality and they will become selfproclaimed spiritualators uh they will learn about the sweats there is some people that uh take them pictures of sweat lodges which you are not supposed to do well they show step by step how to build one and tell you you with some kind of wood to build it out of and ninety percent of the time they tell you the wrong kind of wood um there is a way to do it there is a way to do it but uh it has to be done that way traditionally and there was a reason for that um because the people that is land or giving specific instructions from the creative divisions through uh woman called the black white buffalo and cat woman that came to the people and brought them dcary monies like so large they brought in the shaker pipe it is not a it is not a belief thing it is a way of life and it is a way of life that is still endangering being snuffed out but it will not be it is just it will not be it is just we have got to be careful about uh how what you do and if you look you know native american spirit quality or or religion for the heck of a better word uh because our people believe in religion you can not uh you can not accomplish one word everything that is in the one word 

Recording: (5745/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (5746/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5747/ 9621) 
no not at all i think in the united states it is driving force by of our of our government and and even like because without without a revenue base from the taxes of corporations they could not have nearly the things that we have had and i think to a degree they become fairly powerful but i do not think that is abs necessarily a bad thing uh when the unions were really strong i thought like we were i was reading about it i thought that was a good thing as well because that supports to supporting the person but you could if you have good relations with your labor you do not necessarily need a union 

Recording: (5748/ 9621)

Recording: (5853/ 9621) 
i think for the most part people can handle it uh obviously i think probably more the older generations would be the ones that have the bigger problem with that the ones that grew up like during the whole black rights movement and things like that um i could see them having a problem with it but i mean more like like more of the generations today or whatever like basically anyone down to the age of about forty or fifty so i think that they could they could probably deal with it i mean i do not think it could cause any cuteous problems or anything like that

Recording: (5878/ 9621) 
um well actually i wanted to learn more about it i felt like the guy i really have no passion towards it but i thought this would be a good way to learn about it maybe pick up like uh 

Recording: (5879/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (5880/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (5881/ 9621) 
uh which which the the as far as the the 

Recording: (5882/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5883/ 9621) 
who who 

Recording: (5884/ 9621)

Recording: (5885/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (5886/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5887/ 9621) 
i experienced it well uh in some of our saramunies you know uh this is a potential right no one else is going to see this because i do not want to um i do not want to have a uh just printed or anything you know on to 

Recording: (5888/ 9621) 
yeah got into a situation where you really were there was no wind situation from the good go and uh uh i think that had we been able to do what we you went over there to do it initially it would have worked out okay but we were not so so the capital political war is everybody knows anything about it 

Recording: (5889/ 9621) 
not in my lifetime he would have to probably be a classic a 

Recording: (5890/ 9621) 
well that is just it that is part of it because like i see my parents would not come my mother used to try to come to things at school with i would be in different things and and i have really did a but my father would not he just he would say well you know he just does not like that kind of thing i mean i would be in the sun a spelling i would be in the he he does not well too it and a bag been your butt down there and pretend like you like it and so you know was our field and my husband is the same way his family was his father die when he was nine he was like the adult in the family gam from a buffalo new our working class he left he never looked back either and so it is kind of like you know i have both people i say they say you know how we are such i i do not know we go the schools are always so grateful to us because we organize the state check tournaments he started the baseball league for this building you know he he does a lot of stuff i do a lot of stuff and it is simply because we are so grateful to have this family to be able to be a part of these kids is lives and to go oh to uh i mean coach is baseball he has this you know um basketball we do not miss anything you know it does not matter what it is 

Recording: (5891/ 9621) 
when 

Recording: (5892/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5893/ 9621) 
oh yeah it is 

Recording: (5894/ 9621) 
no because them kids still stop at my house 

Recording: (5895/ 9621) 
she does a really wonderful job because she has a fair for interior design and so that you know presents itself and her the way she sets everything up in the stores it is very attractive 

Recording: (5896/ 9621) 
yeah i have been three i did not really know anything heart attack had too much that good stuff 

Recording: (5897/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5898/ 9621) 
uh basically what you need more is like recreation centers or something in their own neighborhood 

Recording: (5899/ 9621) 
kids because a lot of times maybe they do not get that at home so they are really looking to choose the right thing to do and through school and through education that is their avenue to go in there 

Recording: (5900/ 9621) 
so that like it is just the sheer numbers of it i think 

Recording: (5901/ 9621) 
first year uh finishing it up oh yeah <laugh> oh it is definitely the the beginning <laugh> 

Recording: (5902/ 9621) 
and so uh my parents retired here let us see they have been here i do not know four or five years maybe 

Recording: (5903/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5904/ 9621) 
<laugh> um and sure i feel like uh it is just different than i thought so if i come happy in a place like i should not stay and just be miserable about it 

Recording: (5905/ 9621) 
jerry i mean jerry springer 

Recording: (5906/ 9621) 
thinking um design 

Recording: (5907/ 9621) 
my god 

Recording: (5908/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5909/ 9621) 
my sisterinlaw is one of them she is just too stupid 

Recording: (5910/ 9621) 
because of each you know that he will need that someday i would never have done it 

Recording: (5911/ 9621) 
tied up to you know i think they deserve to die because the prisons and the overcrowding that is a whole another subject you know that just amazing to mean to somebody people in there that should be dead i feel because we are just paying for them to live in there 

Recording: (5912/ 9621) 
wow yeah 

Recording: (5913/ 9621) 
i do not i do not know if that is what perpetates it is very different in the public schools and the public school and the public school you have all the problems in society in the school you have the drive just to have the absentee parents just to see if the delinquent see on the catholic school they just you do not have that for one thing and you know it is oriented around the church even though we are not catholic it is still oriented that says it is on values the permitates everything well they do not do that in the public school because if you do that somebody is gonna get tick off its the wrong value and why are you doing this to my kid uh so i think that is missing and that is a problem within the school the public schools uh so it is this seems to be more you are not less action from the educational process you know when you are in the cadillacs going you are in classroom they deal with the discipline if they need to of course probably the way they deal with them they take the real problems and send them back to the public schools <laugh> uh but in the public schools you just have to deal with this all the time and i think it if it is harder for the teachers to teach because there is too much stuff in the way of what they are when they can relate they are there to do 

Recording: (5914/ 9621) 
um i went to let us see i applied to amory harvard duke university of chicago and washington university so i got into three of those um 

Recording: (5915/ 9621) 
yeah there was you know there was no property 

Recording: (5916/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (5917/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5918/ 9621) 
and by the end of the first week or two they were no longer scale to the magic box than could continue to operating systems um the gullible operating systems is real simple if you are anyway computer and you screw something up the worst thing you can possibly do is screw it up so badly that you have to start over 

Recording: (5919/ 9621) 
i do not even know what their holidays are i i do not know 

Recording: (5920/ 9621) 
i would think so but it was like it is too close to my north or at least 

Recording: (5921/ 9621) 
i mean i think that is the best way to address it and as far as the home as actual i think there is kids who say well maybe i am okay i do not know if i am care right well hopefully do not know their trueident eventually 

Recording: (5922/ 9621) 
oh which is most of it is horrible and they have always find some way to misre present like uh khrush 

Recording: (5923/ 9621) 
directly yes 

Recording: (5924/ 9621) 
there must be something good to get on your tape and they have got people over there where i work at that they will give them the days off as their cats are sick 

Recording: (5925/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5926/ 9621) 
no i do not think it was because i grew up just basic not even really christian just really not no religious religious i had been going to the preterian church as i was about nineteen years old looking for something at church i just had a feeling that i wanted to have that my life because i never had that before and so i just look around and i was open to anything i would listen to in the i have listened to the joe was witnesses and and and then when i read in the book more it is just i i just feel in like like i felt like i had heard it before and it made sense to me and and so that is why i really about at home with us and that i guess i 

Recording: (5927/ 9621) 
oh yeah <laugh> 

Recording: (5928/ 9621) 
so that is probably the roof right that uh 

Recording: (5929/ 9621) 
with thebacp 

Recording: (5930/ 9621) 
<laugh> i figure when the time comes i just have to figure it out <laugh> 

Recording: (5931/ 9621) 
and makes her look good 

Recording: (5932/ 9621) 
oh do you want to run over those are running over 

Recording: (5933/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (5934/ 9621) 
i think 

Recording: (5935/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5936/ 9621) 
well now my young gets on the way to catch that girl who is from a large catholic family and they are kids who are going to the cast these schools 

Recording: (5937/ 9621) 
whoa that is a pretty heat movie 

Recording: (5938/ 9621) 
great <laugh> because he is having his back <laugh> oh yeah that is what everyone says you think <laugh> 

Recording: (5939/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5940/ 9621) 
but uh then there is a lot you know that they could do without them all too that might not be easy to go i do not wanna go there more 

Recording: (5941/ 9621) 
um-hum um-hum 

Recording: (5942/ 9621) 
um i have it personally good but i have seen uh i would personally research it if i was president uh documentaries and what not and things on twenty twenty which i do not wholeheartedly believe just because it is on tv and they say it is so but if it is true and it probably is just because because a lot of people will research it once it is on tv um that three strikes in your out has really seemed to work in california because most of the the people that are committing the violent crimes with guns or rapes or what not um are doing most of the crime so once they are locked up yeah it costs more money to house them for life but they are saving so much because crime has gone down because these people are in jail now on the streets anymore so you do not have to catch them and you do not have to process them et cetera um so i would really like to see that and plus i think once that really is in the work and really working and we really do we are going to say we are doing instead of like little parents no i did not do that no i did not do that you know what i mean because i think that is part of what our problem too 

Recording: (5943/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5944/ 9621) 
what is the deal today when i was a kid you did not want to be barred of the police you are actually scared of the police nowadays what is the kid scared of nothing 

Recording: (5945/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (5946/ 9621) 
i would not know that is why i would not do the hiking things i do not like great i can get like a visa because that is so expensive they will work at least oh 

Recording: (5947/ 9621) 
no i have not 

Recording: (5948/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5949/ 9621) 
they they 

Recording: (5950/ 9621) 
play with them take them in on the kitchen floor so we can room around because our kitchen is like open 

Recording: (5951/ 9621) 
just carrying around the gun and shooting someone 

Recording: (5952/ 9621) 
you know it is a real worry did not you really have to think about it when you start getting there because it was tough dropping them off when they were six weeks old and you are going oh jeez are we doing the right that you know but you know some of this stuff they do and some of this stuff they learn and come home with and we sit down and talk about it and we are just like i do not think we could have ever dreamed t up all this stuff you know and you know kept them entertained all day long by ourselves you know there is no kids in the neighborhood like it was when we were kids you know they are all that day so they you know uh they just are not around anymore it is not the same anymore where you know every other house had some kids and mom was home and stuff so you know they have made i got a lot of friends through there and they still the daughter who is in a different school still associated with friends that are in other school systems that she met at the day care so 

Recording: (5953/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (5954/ 9621) 
uh it counts if you are touching the ground or something that you are sitting on the touching 

Recording: (5955/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5956/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5957/ 9621) 
oh yeah her 

Recording: (5958/ 9621) 
oh we have um dustoh little oftenbredge 

Recording: (5959/ 9621) 
all right 

Recording: (5960/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5961/ 9621) 
it would be nice but now um so 

Recording: (5962/ 9621) 
i i do not care about like how many do it like my mom even wants me to do hers over summer but okay you know i do not 

Recording: (5963/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5964/ 9621) 
and uh oh did they 

Recording: (5965/ 9621) 
right right 

Recording: (5966/ 9621) 
yeah and you know i i would i would have a another job but i would i would love i know you will say this is really stupid but i would love to have a monday through a friday eight to five job never working another evening a saturday or sunday if if can be now i know i will probably not be able to do that because i wish you wants me to come back there so as a contractor so i do not know you know oh 

Recording: (5967/ 9621) 
and finally i do not know whether they are we had a paper of cut of television plain and i do not know whether he so am or who but anyway they find a it is a good to put us in a a a is a back a back of the railroad 

Recording: (5968/ 9621)

Recording: (5969/ 9621)

Recording: (5975/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (5976/ 9621) 
i do not nobody is worth that you know so that is what i am saying it is so retarded uh with i do not mean to use that word in the back yard but it is ridiculous and but uh that that would be that is a better word uh that that people have to are uh have to throw out a case that they may have a legitimate case because they can not afford the legal help so i think that is wrong in this country the land of the free and the home of the brave yeah right you know the land of the free our right and it is a free country but it will cost you 

Recording: (5977/ 9621) 
and you know just sometimes it is just like they are like oh well she could not understand or something like that but for the most part i they are you know no weirdness he is had he had a few cousins you know makes some little comments but 

Recording: (5978/ 9621) 
going to be a really busy day and i would the same thing in poor columbus you know i i would see all these cars but it would be just about the same traffic and i am like and i mentioned somebody go where are the extra the they go they can not add extra airplanes it is they have certain routes they can do they just have to put bigger airplanes on but said you know you will see larger airplanes when it is day time so they can put more people on so 

Recording: (5979/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5980/ 9621) 
it is better in terms of the uh city government seems to the people seem to be more aware of what they are doing and it is not oh well just do this it is kind of like you know there is some brains down there <laugh> 

Recording: (5981/ 9621)

Recording: (5983/ 9621) 
uh i was over there for a couple of weeks in the harbor i never sat foot on the land 

Recording: (5984/ 9621) 
um-hum um 

Recording: (5985/ 9621) 
little house for the bunch of guys on that yeah so fully different um one of the things that i really enjoyed that was different as the traffic and that really no that really that really became really became uh interesting in different for me when i started working for a career the service winter quarter i took off i took all classes off winter quarter and worked for career service and i need some money and i love driving and let me tell you it is really really different driving around out in the big city compared down the country man i mean you are flying down seventy one or seventy three through town and you go as fast as everybody else is going in if they are going eighty you are going eighty <laugh> and if they are going two you are going two you know i mean my dad i brought him down to columbus a few times because my dad and i are real close and um i am driving around and you know they have been between cars and he is like i forgot what it is like living in the city because he used to live in chicago but uh that is one of the things i really enjoy one of the things that do not like about living in the big city is is like but i have gotten used to but i i do not like in fact that every time you look up in the nice sky all these he sees is like or in the dorms <laugh> you can not see stars very well uh the noise i mean there is always noise i remember last year living in the dorms every morning at two thirty in the morning there was a trash truck that picked up some trash from a bar right behind where we lived and i lived in taylor so it is this it is it is in a t shape and the the side of the b building all the sounds just rolls right up the wall and this trash truck made so much stinking noise it is ridiculous every single morning at two thirty yeah i did not i i developed uh i developed the the the ability to sleep through anything which is and that is that is uh one of the fascinating things when i go home dead silence dead silence and that is now where i have a problem sleeping because because there is no noise there is no noise i am so used to like turning my radio on and draining out all the back ground sounds that i have to like have music on in the room so um yeah everything in in high thirty ten oclock and it all starts up at nine thirty ten oclock here in columbus and that is so oh other than that i love going out been that like two oclock in the morning <laugh> um redsone redsone we usually they open up at nine or ten oclock depending on got a special show coming in or not but that is the place i really like on um they uh they are open till usually two thirty two oclock all depends um um i uh came to columbus and you know raised and it is really really really conservative extremely christian religious unity of asheland and i came to columbus and i started meeting you know i started meeting the extremely taboo group of homosexuals and i have found some of those fascinating people i am on this planet our homosexuals um and they are not nearly they they are not the the the evil people that that everybody back home and our community always said they were you know it is just like these are not normal people you know i may not agree with what they are doing but they are not normal people and i have got some really cool people who are who are on the especiallyals and that leave where that um we went to access which is uh one of the home it is one of the gay um uh dance clubs in columbus it is um it is on high street it is down in uh it is down in a german building now it sounds like the movie it is down 

Recording: (5986/ 9621) 
i am 

Recording: (5987/ 9621) 
you know they want to be judge is like everybody else but i you know i think um deither one of them is right but still um i i think there is always going to barrier their their just kids who are just not all kids are going to get along you know i mean 

Recording: (5988/ 9621) 
back ground 

Recording: (5989/ 9621) 
and you know you have a hard thing there but then if you teach the teachers that they are not going to be quite and they are not going to you know um look at this flatterie 

Recording: (5990/ 9621) 
we have not been there in a while but i mean we do go 

Recording: (5991/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5992/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5993/ 9621) 
and so it it is the thing is though it is almost like i am really glad that i am willing to say i just can not make this he let he let my daughter who is thirty he loved loved her the movies one night they went to movies they was no uh the movie they went to see was sold out the next one was not going to start until nine thirty which means just gets twelve years old so that would have been boy and although this tom boy who is just amazing but anyhow he leaves her there with one of her friends some boy and although this tom boy who is just amazing but so anyhow he leaves her there and uh they said they called me but i did not i was running the sleepers so i did not go to the phone so after there and he said that she was going to call back you know at a certain time and i was going to tell her what she could or could not do so i said you know we are going to have to come here at home you know he is gonna have to come and get you all coming home and i said i know we are gonna do that i you know you can not be his plate so he went back down and picked him and i said let the kid come to our house he can come here until eleven 

Recording: (5994/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (5995/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5996/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5997/ 9621) 
yeah <laugh> yeah <laugh> 

Recording: (5998/ 9621) 
you know you know i mean 

Recording: (5999/ 9621) 
the bad plays of television things that they have on that programs they have on and i think that they have had a lot to do with changing our younger generation and the way they think the way they act what their morals are and i think that is why they are having more shootings in schools and uh i the programs are terrible i think that they need to really redo them there is too much for vanity there is too much sex there is too much just doing what i want i got to do my own thing that is why the when the i want to do my own thing he starts he says with the women is feminine this movement <laugh> <laugh> and it probably did and it probably did have something to do with it uh because as i said there is so much speaking up and they want to do things with mine oh oh being across you was no um 

Recording: (6000/ 9621) 
there is the ones that will get out there with their pickup signs they will raise how okay 

Recording: (6001/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (6002/ 9621) 
yeah exactly and it is just uh it is just ridiculous but so many people do not seem to think that way i do think you access it would help us access where we are or at least if they were more careful about it i mean it seems like even the laws that they are on place now are not necessarily followed and you know that kind of thing um-hum 

Recording: (6003/ 9621) 
because they are so styly 

Recording: (6004/ 9621) 
it is difficult you feel alone a lot of the time uh and i am not as liberal as i used to be uh so i think some of a is it gets tempered a little bit but still tend to be a little more liberal and uh you know it is just a matter who i vote for they are going to lose uh and i just stay out a lot of discussions it was interesting to me uh our mother raised us in a way that we were always allowed to discuss politics and religion anything we wanted to uh but you know she would stop if we got to the point where we were getting physical or name calling or something like that and it was after i left home actually before i realized that not everybody is that way not everybody wants to hear your views uh so i uh particularly around my inlaws they are very conservative of southern ohio uh raised during the depression uh in a depressed area so uh i learned my motherinlaw took anytime she disagreed with her his a personal attack on her so i just learned just about to see anything yeah uh my fatherinlaw was not that way but my motherinlaw was 

Recording: (6005/ 9621) 
very different uh just been a lot of invasions 

Recording: (6006/ 9621) 
um i mean in fact of the matter is if being a is a genetic disorder then that should have no effect on the kids because they should still be uh normal i guess or whatever you want to say 

Recording: (6007/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (6008/ 9621) 
um well because my cousins and uh they all have uh they are very you know everybody is all educated and they are more affluent and i think that uh maybe there would have been more opportunity for my dad there 

Recording: (6009/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (6010/ 9621)

Recording: (6019/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (6020/ 9621) 
you know how far they held responsible i do not know you would have to go on a case by case basis 

Recording: (6021/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6022/ 9621) 
yeah uh 

Recording: (6023/ 9621) 
and i did have a very serious relationship in florida uh he was quite a bit younger than i was and i knew he wanted children and i never wanted children unfortunately i i love animals and things but i just never decided i never wanted children and i knew he eventually would so uh i was engaged in them but i decided to 

Recording: (6024/ 9621) 
wow i am getting i am getting it to a <laugh> 

Recording: (6025/ 9621) 
humum humum 

Recording: (6026/ 9621) 
to the most part yeah i mean obviously like they said they came out and said the catholic church was against it but at the same time like research things like that where they are i am saying that it could be a mental disorder or some sorts where i mean they could not can not so much really condem it to to the point anymore that they used to 

Recording: (6027/ 9621) 
but it is because most people would have sold it and moved to a more expensive home and had a bigger mortgage so it is just that kind of thing 

Recording: (6028/ 9621) 
i do not know actually probably if i went up there now i would like it but you know but it is not uh uh i do not like it as well as columbus at all mainly i suppose because of the university anyway yeah 

Recording: (6029/ 9621) 
just you know 

Recording: (6030/ 9621) 
the world uh really i am talking about that but my exwife got family here so uh you know she comes in about two or three weeks at least of the summer 

Recording: (6031/ 9621) 
i heard about that but the same principle applies but i am talking about just everyday things uh that uh people is when we were going to talk to talk to children primarily uh there is no penalty anymore uh parents are scared to death to to pick uh one up and spank um come uh even with their bare hands or or to make them stand in the corner because they consider them and and going back to the word harassment child abuse and our harassment of consequence uh and uh uh and penalty can be a very very simple thing a mother can simply look at jail in tin tin jeny you should not do that 

Recording: (6032/ 9621) 
oh yeah um 

Recording: (6033/ 9621) 
well yeah i think it is real important to really get a good uh feel for how you are and all your beliefs and all that they have to really match and uh and if they do not um then it is not ever going to work because there is always going to be conflict in friction and all that kind of thing so i think it is real important and there is no age limit on that to when you really feel good about yourself when you really know what you want to do then that is the only time that you can really commit and say yeah we do have a mutual being and young people they are you know there is so many different inf actuallyations to start with that they get blinded and they get you know off course and everything else and and then it does not stay the same i mean it is all exciting and and all that and then you know i think it is kind of <laugh> 

Recording: (6034/ 9621) 
uh blue diskout 

Recording: (6035/ 9621)

when he died um i was about thirty 

Recording: (6039/ 9621)

Recording: (6040/ 9621) 
i know the valedictorian of harvard lake in the junior class 

Recording: (6041/ 9621) 
yeah much too fast for me uh uh 

Recording: (6042/ 9621) 
connexting some wires across up here or something and they are so they become very distrustful of adults because all their life people have been saying 

Recording: (6043/ 9621) 
yeah yeah <laugh> 

Recording: (6044/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6045/ 9621) 
that uh encompasses the uh theory that all things happen for a reason even though it seems like it is a accident uh there is a flow of spirit in this world on things or moving at a pace that they are supposed to move that and things happen and death is part of life physical death and that is one of the things that i also learn to that so that you do not die you do not physically maybe you know there is you know deny that but spiritually not even physical death can break that at once 

Recording: (6046/ 9621) 
right i think that is pretty neat 

Recording: (6047/ 9621) 
and um 

Recording: (6048/ 9621)

Recording: (6056/ 9621) 
uh i think i think it is i think it is fair i think it should be that domestic partners should be should be covered i think there should probably be some uh some down to some repsome 

Recording: (6057/ 9621) 
yeah we had a my mom has a friend that does ultra sounds 

Recording: (6058/ 9621) 
do they think that we would be ready 

Recording: (6059/ 9621) 
you know he had he had 

Recording: (6060/ 9621) 
and it is not 

Recording: (6061/ 9621) 
you know when he is up at night i i have to do it for my responsibility you know and i mean people think that you know oh you get a lot help in there <laugh> they have their lives i do not mind <laugh> 

Recording: (6062/ 9621) 
did not have it done through saramony nothing like that and even the man that he followed for a while is sitting in a rust home over in south dakota now because he is old he is on his way out and he was a road man gave his life you know for eighty nine tribes they helped him find and refine their connection with their spirit drive that they would lost um because of the missionaries bringing christianity i mean uh 

Recording: (6063/ 9621) 
yeah my my best friend lives in on outside campground and she has a lot of medical problems but uh 

Recording: (6064/ 9621) 
uh i was exposed to a lot of men who were not brought up as as i was but there were a lot of them that were 

Recording: (6065/ 9621) 
the name i uh actually read a story in some book about this black lady that was having like her ninth and tenth kid and she she did not know what she had twins and she did not know what to name them and she would run out of names that she likes so they brought her um lunch into her and the nurse joggingly said or the aid or something well he is picking a couple of names off the menu so she named them lamongello and ir and lemon jhe lemon and orange jello she picks lemon and lemon and orange and orange and turned them into limongello and orange the niece and the nephew <laugh> 

Recording: (6066/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6067/ 9621) 
you know technically there is insanity and there is an insanity but in my opinion there is nobody whoever kills anybody who is an insane and uh just to to to knock them out is is not appropriate they need to be we need to try to save them i mean kind of in the terms of the christian saving but uh to make them work that off and uh face it and come in their own mind to their own so i have got two sites to that once they need to work because they did it and other right is if we keep uh i i believe in the uh uh uh reincarination the law costsin effect and if a person murders somebody they need though they will pay for that later there is no question about that in the next life but also i think that they should be made to face their um they are guilt in what they have done and and a lot of them do not they say that hardened criminals real hard criminals will not ever admit that they did anything wrong and they have to they need to 

Recording: (6068/ 9621) 
get them thinking about it and then they will start going notice it in their real life and once they start noticing it they will start getting more and more into it 

Recording: (6069/ 9621) 
they will say oh well this sounds is going to be he is two right now that is you know you know changes his so it so it does not come out to be be a problem or whatever but i mean i think they need to leave that to the decision of the people 

Recording: (6070/ 9621) 
it is 

Recording: (6071/ 9621) 
you can not you can not be mad at somebody for choosing life style you just can not life is too short you know i mean you can love them either way it does not make any difference 

Recording: (6072/ 9621) 
right the same way with kids if you have a penalty for them they will learn their lesson but it is also the parent that has to set the example and there is too many older pokes right now i do not think because of two people have to work outside the house they get home they are aggravated they are upset somebody else is having their kids all day and it is it is it is terrible to be situationations got that way but i do believe that the older people including our government people and everybody that is at the top has to set the example and stick with it 

Recording: (6073/ 9621) 
and she was speaking and and she started to speak i realized you know another thing that i really feel has a tremendous impression on how we as people are doing here but how the politicians are because the world world in essence it is getting smaller because the communication has gotten better and all these other countries and us there is just like all one country anymore or something and i think that is had a tremendous influence also on in our politics and on we as the people 

Recording: (6074/ 9621) 
oh uh-huh 

Recording: (6075/ 9621) 
now that was up to age eight came to where they are about too i think that the you should get back to the very beginning of the bird we are setting up to kindergarten so forth with i that is that is the family uh i think that we in our educational program we really you need to start teaching uh what i call the older values but but good values i do not look at any whether they are older or new but good values and i think we really need to have that established within our educational system uh starting in the elementary right on up through college i think there ought to be a number of college uh courses uh that uh devoted exclusively for this so that those students can go back and uh uh assist in teaching but i think that many of the courses other courses to have elements within them that are teaching value family values uh i could even still go so far as to see any chemistry or botany or psychology uh any one of those those are specialized subject and and but i think there are elements that they can have within each one of those talking about family value family value uh and i would well help then permit the interest of anybody anybody that is got to you start back here on the first and i think 

Recording: (6076/ 9621) 
and sooner or later you know all the people that have gotten into political offices and public service a guarantee they went in it with the ideal of wanting to help hope them make a difference but but once they get in there it is such a bureaucracy 

Recording: (6077/ 9621) 
and it is not just like one group of people 

Recording: (6078/ 9621) 
that that is what making these kids think they they can do it i just really think 

Recording: (6079/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6080/ 9621) 
oh you do now 

Recording: (6081/ 9621) 
<laugh> yeah 

Recording: (6082/ 9621) 
in english um-hum 

Recording: (6083/ 9621) 
yeah so i i have experience in that and i i am thankful that it was always a peaceful sort of thing <laugh> it is going on inside your head and your body is not that peaceful yeah 

Recording: (6084/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (6085/ 9621) 
for example so you should name her camera 

Recording: (6086/ 9621) 
so i have just the same opinion i think most people have it as as tv 

Recording: (6087/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6088/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6089/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (6090/ 9621) 
pots never been uh never been associated with any kind of a crime that was some a violent crime 

Recording: (6091/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6092/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (6093/ 9621) 
then you have a choice there you would not necessarily uh have you should have had more self control and i had the child expect me to pay for your uh lack of uh will power that that is a selfish attitude that is stealing as well 

Recording: (6094/ 9621) 
i see no i mean it 

Recording: (6095/ 9621) 
in a way yeah i think that would be good yeah movie a new name 

Recording: (6096/ 9621) 
well i you know the crime you can not really stop and other things that happen just you know too much partying around i mean that is why el left full of avenue because they could not you know but you know just everybody other than neighbors being allowed and everything my mom is older so she can not really put up with any of that and 

Recording: (6097/ 9621) 
i have just kind of appalled what they put on the news anyway it is not usually what i consider news it is a lot of human interest stories and things like that which 

Recording: (6098/ 9621) 
i really and it is bizarre 

Recording: (6099/ 9621) 
um i do not know i mean i i like florida just because it is not cold and it is it is really nice but it rains a lot i mean and i do not i mean i i would rather live out out west because it is like a dry heat as opposed to being i mean it is nice that it is ninety degrees but it is not ninety percent humidity i mean that is kind of that kind of but um it is just different to live in florida and how you think of florida being is real different like um i like because it kind of the the drivers are not some insane like they are here like people are a little bit more laid back just because like um i do not know in parts it is really insane but like sometimes it is just people are just like because it is because it is nice weather people do not get so like aggravated by like here it is like cold and and gray and you just want to like yellow people in their car and stuff for something i do not know i do not know what people feel is 

Recording: (6100/ 9621) 
basically because of plans which the utilities had for our location they could not provide to us because of the uh the best of our rules so we had to go out and uh doing their own surveys becomes self educated through uh of course uh through att and through purdue university it was and they told you had some of course and and uh ultimately the university here now has i think a major in telecommunication group but uh the projects basically we were going from a uh network itself and uh we had uh you think of a pay line system where they used to call uh daisy chain in the industry uh you had to wait and wait for you turn to get on on to uh data network and uh we got down to the point where in fact we went to a spook network where everyone has dedicated pipe 

Recording: (6101/ 9621) 
uh been yeah i was not much i my being here and my daughter being here i did not really have the uh time with her than i wish i would have had you know but uh uh from other you know did they are all right and everything but i wish i would have been more involved in their growing up and i think two people then would these are generally better you know for not necessarily living and being you know uh being married and everything but 

Recording: (6102/ 9621) 
sure we can do that <laugh> 

Recording: (6103/ 9621) 
yeah my brother is well he is the oldest oldest but two sisters pretty much all the ones that i really care about two sisters and their husbands 

Recording: (6104/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6105/ 9621) 
yeah it was not anything too huge i think it had about twelve hundred people in it or so 

Recording: (6106/ 9621) 
yeah they got a lot of people i do not i do not know why a lot of people go but like with a lot of people i know it is like good is not really good music like it is amazing like what happens you know like people together and like people dancing together you look at everybody is dancing you know and like the music is really good everybody is really into it and working 

Recording: (6107/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6108/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6109/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6110/ 9621) 
most people i associate with and this and that are a lot more involved in there with their kids than say our parents where as kids you know 

Recording: (6111/ 9621) 
i 

Recording: (6112/ 9621) 
but neither that they are into goes back to uh you know the quality or the corner or anything i mean obviously just poor kid you know apparently was from this point of his life that he was going down the stairs in the you know to figure out some way of uh reaching his neir van or whatever you know and uh and his parents never close ooh or if they did it did not care you know 

Recording: (6113/ 9621) 
but at the same time it is not like they had the intent to do it so i can not see anything too incredibly severe um but i mean i was thinking it should be consider basically child neglect things like that um basically the same penalties that you run into for that um but but i mean they obviously do need to make it more severe because obviously your kids has the opportunity to kill themselves with a gun 

Recording: (6114/ 9621) 
oh yes definitely in england too 

Recording: (6115/ 9621) 
that he did not 

Recording: (6116/ 9621) 
yeah so and a lot of people turn eighteen when they are in high school so i am sure they can go get one there 

Recording: (6117/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (6118/ 9621) 
yes i do uh about i try to visit at least uh at least two every two years we either we go to new york or we meet offway a couple years ago we met at penn state and uh so you know the older ones are all dying also so 

Recording: (6119/ 9621) 
yeah <laugh> 

Recording: (6120/ 9621) 
yeah eighty four 

Recording: (6121/ 9621) 
oh it is just so every the environment of course is incredibly beautiful uh and everybody is more uh i think more open or more receptive to relationships and um you know i think it is a friend much friendly or a place and then i i i just think the vibration are higher up there you just do not have poverty well if anybody is in poverty in oregon it is because they have chosen to live as simple life it is not a you know because they can not get jobs and things like that although the economy in oregon is not that great but you know they say in using and even the dishwasher is to have phd <laugh> well the the uh the level of the years of education sheper cabinets probably the highest in the country 

Recording: (6122/ 9621) 
i thought other important roles where would you be where would your mother possibly she went to catholic school i take it where would she have been is it one for the nun why are we putting on this down hey they work lot less in your mind is not gonna come say a four and they have a very important role for your development even though your generation is removed 

Recording: (6123/ 9621) 
yeah yeah <laugh> and the funny thing about that is if i heard one of those songs once i might not be that turned off by it <laugh> but if you are gonna play it at me you know six times in three hours <laugh> 

Recording: (6124/ 9621) 
i heard something the other day that really it really upset me i was at um this convention downtown convention center and i wanted a l ladies that was presenting one of the work shops is a college professor in english at one of the ohio colleges and she said when she started teaching in nineteen eighty five they would always she teaches writing technical writing for people to do when they get out into the industry world reports and stuff she said they used to say gear your you are writing to a person who is in the aids grade 

Recording: (6125/ 9621) 
that is great 

Recording: (6126/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6127/ 9621) 
well actually i have picked up a part time job just in the past month or two so i am i am working for a research firm just for the venience of the hours i i wanna go back into the nursing field but right now i just can not take that much time away because it would be at least an eight hour shift and uh i do not think that we are ready for that yet he is a teacher um-hum he works at high school yeah he teaches ninth and tenth graders <laugh> <laugh> no <laugh> i do not think that i oh i would be deceiving myself i think i i guess when i i hear about them i am just like oh my gosh i can not believe all of the the things that these kids are experiencing i did not know about whatever until i was much much older i did not worry about bought that when i was by age and it is kind of scary 

Recording: (6128/ 9621) 
and uh and they are not the kind that would go out and just shoot me and i am going to be shoot it they would use it food they sometimes they i know one time that they gave it to a family that was uh did not have any money and did not have any food they when it kills so many animals and gave it to them they do not have a problem with that uh but my brotherinlaw is very much opposed to any kind of gun control he he believes whatever charles h withst in tells it 

Recording: (6129/ 9621) 
i think my grand pago is at church 

Recording: (6130/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6131/ 9621)

Recording: (6132/ 9621) 
and he troubles all over the state of ohio 

Recording: (6133/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (6134/ 9621)

Recording: (6135/ 9621) 
and unfortunately uh they did not really prove anything except that they that death is falling on them 

Recording: (6136/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (6137/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6138/ 9621) 
you you why are you doing eight children now 

Recording: (6139/ 9621) 
i think it would probably i i think it would be certainly interesting 

Recording: (6140/ 9621) 
um yes and no like i said i think the average person is pretty decent person i mean i do not think there is anything involved on or there is anything wrong with them but at the same time it is just the media of folks that are out of control and makes a big deals of the ones that are are out of control and i think that is sort of what people pick up the perception to be i mean they do not they do not show about like when people are helping people out or things like that when the local high schools like volunteering at like the local senior citizen so or something like that 

Recording: (6141/ 9621) 
but i am like it test scores are identical and they had the exact same experience you know objective ways 

Recording: (6142/ 9621) 
because i do not know it just was like if i get pregnant i get pregnant they you do not know of what you really have to go through of having a baby you know because i guess i really did not care it and if i got pregnant i got pregnant it did not it did not really you know register my mind that this will you know not run but it will it will change your whole life 

Recording: (6143/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6144/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6145/ 9621) 
yeah and it just did not work 

Recording: (6146/ 9621)

<laugh> 

Recording: (6152/ 9621) 
um they more or less buy a dog for a token 

Recording: (6153/ 9621) 
well i guess i would have to say i do not necessarily like middle school but see when you get a specialized certificate you are sort of five kindergarten to twelve so i did several years in high school when i was first out of college i did high school first and then i went to elementary well kids from elementary so i could kind of keep in touch with what they were supposed to be learning you know and then six years ago i went to the middle school and i have decided that i am too old to give up with these kids not only are they learning disability in eighty d but they are middle schoolers and they have like hormones runs rampant all over the outside of their bodies you can tell which is the hormones and which is the cd and which is the learning disability but like i said i only have two more years to go well i guess i can live through that 

Recording: (6154/ 9621) 
i think it is better probably at the do not know i can say anything about it you know and most of the people you know like when you get to i lived in the barroaks all the time but i mean you know a lot of people you know they get their own places on base you know and it cares when i say i do not i do not care you know like you say i have a case run you know i do not care what they doing i mean this they are old enough to do whatever act they are talking to you know

Recording: (6171/ 9621) 
i you know from my perspective which is skewed of course to me i think it just seems that way i mean it was we are only talking about ten cases that is not very many you know i mean you could by coincidence have them all be african american um if i were african american i think i would have a different perspective and i you know i do not do not live in the neighborhood where we see a lot of police so uh you know i just do not i am i am not in touch with it with that brighted

Recording: (6178/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (6179/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (6180/ 9621) 
we have definitely made some progress in that direction i still think that there is considerable progress that needs to be made uh i was just talking to someone a couple of weeks ago who is a fellow history major and her actually her brother is a fellow history history major too and a friend of mine i do not know them all that well at least apparently her family i mean she is she is double major history and chemistry she plans to go to med school her parents her family supports are in this but they have made it painfully clear that when that she should not plan on having a career because then she is going to have to raise children at some point which is uh that is not the way things should work in my belief and in the fact that it is like the meals telling the daughter like this is how things need to be yeah i think i mean you know i think an individual individual should have the choice but i feel i mean i i am concerned about a a uh like this push to the rain that is sort of going on hoping it is sort of dying out but i mean it seemed a little scary here back in like ninety four ninety five then uh i think we have reached a point where because not all of the advances have been one hundred percent successful the the often sition is criticize the advance 

Recording: (6181/ 9621) 
but when he did have something to do with them it was kind of strange they would go out and wh is at girls and stuff like that 

Recording: (6182/ 9621)

Recording: (6265/ 9621) 
um-hum um-hum 

Recording: (6266/ 9621) 
oh there always has been there always has been i think a lot of people feel that kids a lot of kids are on medication today that should not be but uh i think that is the fault of the school or the parents or some doctor that like for example and we have refer kids in arlington to a doctor we have a list of three doctors that we work with and we know is that they will not just give this kid a pill if he does not have eight out of the twelve systems or whatever so we refer them to those doctors and then if this doctor is those doctors are pretty conservative too and if they put them on med that is usually just for the school day not during the summer not over vacation not after five oclock not on the weekends and it is just to help them focus and then these doctors also ask for reports back from the teachers and if you do not see any maerable difference in two or three weeks then you take the kid off and you try something else and some kids the medication is like the between between that and day you go back and observe the kid you can not believe it the same kid other kids might not be doinging a glass of water well since they have side effects dougar grows and they subdo your appetite and some of the other you know some kids get headache from getcadrein and adderall so i say you know if it were makes use it if it if it does not work just forget it but you know a lot of people feel that too many kids are on this stuff because there may be just not a able to pay attention a little bit but they are not really ad and the parents are taking them in and going johnny is not getting straight a way he is putting one something <laugh> so i guess 

Recording: (6267/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (6268/ 9621)

Recording: (6272/ 9621)

Recording: (6277/ 9621)

Recording: (6278/ 9621) 
which was the going thing 

Recording: (6279/ 9621) 
um i have a class at um high school that it is called bread and it is like um you know all the kids in there are people that have kids and 

Recording: (6280/ 9621) 
i have got nothing against christianity but i got something against the way it was brought here 

Recording: (6281/ 9621) 
yeah exactly 

Recording: (6282/ 9621) 
well they needed to strike do not get me wrong that is not the stupid part but the part was uh the majority of them saying that they were here for ten years and they made that much money most people would move on 

Recording: (6283/ 9621) 
yeah well the white man would probably win but the black man also has a he has a better chance than the woman i would think 

Recording: (6284/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6285/ 9621) 
that 

Recording: (6286/ 9621) 
you know what um actually i do not believe they have anything book so far a lot of times i think this year people are more going out rather than having people come into their homes and things i have usually i have worked for different hotels where i have always worked on new year is eve and my husband this year is like you know but we do not even have any plans we were gonna maybe do something with some friends and i am going to california so i am not sure even exactly what i am going to do but uh right now there is not an even events scheduled 

Recording: (6287/ 9621) 
no really i mean different cultures and everything uh uh i i went to school with blacks so i mean that was not that big a thing except prove it and plus of the you know i never in the real age how many were being drafted or being in listening to the service at the time and everything or how many actually were even in the in the country you know 

Recording: (6288/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6289/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6290/ 9621) 
and i mean yes they find the cause of it whatever you know that is good but at the same time the the cause of it does not really matter i mean the fact of the matter is it there they have to deal with it so 

Recording: (6291/ 9621) 
um media has a lot of control over people but i believe that sometimes people just need a kick like that 

Recording: (6292/ 9621) 
they did 

Recording: (6293/ 9621) 
see so see i would rather if i were going to buy house than clintonville to hold them and rent them my problem is i do not have any money so i that down payment it has to be ten percent down and so that means that i would have that tied up while it was being rented like we bought a couple condos over on bevelled road for my kids to live in so my oldest girl when she was getting ready to move out she was like twenty four and they could not find any place to live that i thought was that that i felt was safe and that was acceptable so i finally decided i did well we will find something and i will buy it and i will be your land lady and then the boy it will it will be nice and so i bought that one and then my other daughter wanted to was thinking she was gonna move out when she i came away from high school and changed your mind so i just rented that one but it the bond line is i i just got a second mortgage and i have a guy that i work with that helped me buy those without any money i did not have of a down payment i had nothing so so it is like i could afford to hang onto those because their rent just makes the payment but the other you would you would be fine you would be running you would not buy anything that you did not think you could rent and come out even with 

Recording: (6294/ 9621) 
you know i just got out of it 

Recording: (6295/ 9621) 
yeah and and immigration from different countries and those people come in and they have got their input and i think that it is just a mixture of everything 

Recording: (6296/ 9621) 
and do not insulted us anymore or we will go to trial uh some attorney jumped the back up to a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars i could not take sitting there these guys going back and forth of what they felt i was worth even our are which way that system the more

Recording: (6298/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6299/ 9621) 
and there are no computer manuals for it so you have to figure it out totally on your own i do not think you are going to get into that 

Recording: (6300/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah i am just learning the area so but i like it so far it seems really nice and uh so it seems like there is a lot more to do upon calling this obviously but 

Recording: (6301/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (6302/ 9621) 
biz him 

Recording: (6303/ 9621)

Recording: (6304/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (6305/ 9621) 
well i lived on twelve maybe about four or five years ago probably longer but that was just for a summer thing you know after i saw the couch being burned us that is new

Recording: (6315/ 9621) 
<laugh>

a little bit faster uh but then in then when i get out of the service i get twenty two you know that is kind of like behind everybody you know as far as my age group and stuff that did not have to go and uh so i had had a lot of uh good times as far as that goes and you know cleanliness and they are sort of gollyness and well that stuff you know i mean a lot of people do not there is just a lot of lack stuff goes on today in my opinion but 

Recording: (6323/ 9621) 
like you means actual relationships and what um probably the the bad things about it yeah um but just coming from like christian beliefs and what not the best thing and i know it even though i did not partake in it when i was a teenager and i was not promiscuous at all but i still had sex before marriage um just to be it would be nice if they teach you how to be confident in yourself and i do not mean like self esteem but you know like we said if if uh you know you come from a situation like that that does not mean you have to be like that do you know what i mean kind of 

Recording: (6324/ 9621) 
and uh as our our engineers the engineers per se but they are techies uh are really into this they they enjoy their work and it is a poor it in the forefront of ohio government along with the technology there has to always be the paperwork and i know realize we have a peopleous environment um quote unquote 

Recording: (6325/ 9621) 
um i was in the more north florida around dallas i see so that is that is a little different i mean that is that is not that is more southern georgia basically um um i do not know i mean yeah it is not so touristy and they they are the thing where you could not have any buildings bigger than the state capitol oh because they did not want it to be like orlando or miami like miami especially so it was really interesting it was a different type of town like not not so many palm trees more big oak trees something like that yeah it is real it is more not all of us centralized downtown it is more of a like it is spreading out uh 

Recording: (6326/ 9621) 
even my mother who is in she said if nick somewhere run it and they she would vote for them she is that much of a conservative uh agree with what is happened but most people will say the same i mean there should have been another way to get him out of there but at this point i do not think there really was a a few months ago you know but 

Recording: (6327/ 9621) 
i am not sure i do not know his his dad found it and pulled me about it because i was not working at the time and we were trying to get an extra income to come in and um his dad made actually like twenty five dollars or something you know i would think he would make more than the next man every time we go over the reason phone the computer doing something and i am on there you know just i look up baby stuff get coupons and stuff uh you know like reading about things that happen to people like their kids getting up in their face or something 

Recording: (6328/ 9621) 
and ones you like them to see that you do not like 

Recording: (6329/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6330/ 9621) 
i do not know i saw it in the paper some kid was suspended because he had a paper he would do a picture of a gun and cut it out 

Recording: (6331/ 9621) 
it is just out of control i mean like i said i mean that is sort of kids for you i mean they just obviously they can be curious about things and the parent definitely does have to be held responsible for it but i do not know to what degree that they should go with it 

Recording: (6332/ 9621) 
i mean if i would have chosen to do that well that is my choice you and your husband it is like what are you making these things maybe not back specifically much just like general rules for good living in your church at the same one thing but realistically you think maybe something a little bit different but what do you mean about all that conflict oh god my husband is a lot better at these people questions because he was methodist and he chose to jane catholic when we got married and his perception of the methodist religion and the catholic religion and the more i was exposed to has is like boy these really are similar but yours is a lot looser than mine and you know who is you know um just teaching him to be honest and open and being able to talk about sex and drugs and being there and opening keeping the lines of communication open and then it goes back to the family being available and doing meaningful things with the children 

Recording: (6333/ 9621) 
um-hum okay 

Recording: (6334/ 9621) 
you can not see it in a day 

Recording: (6335/ 9621)

Recording: (6336/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6337/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6338/ 9621) 
yeah but you put up with that anywhere it is not just a hot day to be anywhere you go you know it is just like i said you get excuse me you get ass holes in 

Recording: (6339/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6340/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (6341/ 9621) 
i do not know about that yeah he has not shown that period yet i do not know if he is supposed to be showing it now or not because um i mean when he gives it and amy is yeah by mam you know <laugh> look up okay by <laugh> 

Recording: (6342/ 9621) 
she is doing all right as far as i know she is going to saint louis university you know they are going to ask me why but 

Recording: (6343/ 9621) 
<laugh> but um uh one time i i read somewhere that a a mexican lady who came across the border to have her baby and they put the little band on and they wrote female and then they wrote her last name she said your husband when he came over to see her well they have already named her look from molly 

Recording: (6344/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (6345/ 9621) 
well unfortunately i do not think it is fair but i think in the long run it does not have to be a college education because most of those people probably would not want a college vacation uh but like a trade or a skill or something that will give them a little bit of hope if they do want to choose to get a job instead of right i mean to bank or selling drugs or whatever they did they have that choice it is it is it is up on their head okay i can either go become a welder or i can have a gone um i mean if they want a college education um yeah it is it is not fair but for for you growing up and going into a lifestyle i would prefer having their colleges paid for and then being productive citizens than somebody robbing me some day because they did not get an education i mean you know that is a broad spectrum and i know it is not all that could not drive um yeah that would upset me but hopefully i would step back from it a little bit and go yeah 

Recording: (6346/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6347/ 9621) 
uh well i paid for one thing when i was overseas if we wanted to do something we would wait till the sarge went in the shed and we would just put a padlock on the door so he could not get out 

Recording: (6348/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (6349/ 9621) 
um-hum um-hum 

Recording: (6350/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah yeah it is being glamorousized and they do not they do not value human life either i do not think because there is so much violence you know you can not watch tv and that is seeing somebody gets shot or something and it is just like it is not really real because it is you know you turn the channel and then you see the same actor doing something out with you and it looks at you know it was not real and i do not think they i i do not know 

Recording: (6351/ 9621)

Recording: (6369/ 9621)

Recording: (6370/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (6371/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6372/ 9621) 
just different stuff it is different every day that is why i like it just like with utah and people it is different every day 

Recording: (6373/ 9621) 
that is pretty extreme 

Recording: (6374/ 9621) 
but it takes to 

Recording: (6375/ 9621) 
three years 

Recording: (6376/ 9621) 
it is available it is just whether they go and put forth the effort 

Recording: (6377/ 9621) 
and so uh soon as my shop found out that i could draw that or ninety dollars a month it is 

Recording: (6378/ 9621) 
was not it hard 

Recording: (6379/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6380/ 9621) 
and i was born in new york 

Recording: (6381/ 9621) 
and i am saying i could take that route but it would cost me a lot of money that i do not have to get the legal defense and it would be just best for me to take the respond onsusbility like i have and i sold the car that i had to my sister uh i am going to pay back the apartment complex that i signed at least for uh but i am going to make them come after me you know come you know uh i already went to court once and and uh well even even with the evidence being in my favor i mean i was only at this place three months i did not do any damage to it uh and the walls did not need to paint it i was not there long enough to make them dirty uh but um their own person even went through on the first run after i moved out and my mother and i and i clean out things spot my stop bottom bathrooms and wash the floors and pop the floors and everything and uh their own person came through and said it rated the a which meant according to their system a meant no 

Recording: (6382/ 9621) 
those are the former right of yours of a child 

Recording: (6383/ 9621) 
i think it has changed drastically and i think it is changing and i think it will also be changing in the future uh going all the way back gulf finances uh we are we are not a consideration in the in oh i would say probably my first thirty maybe forty years there was some there was infoance but i think the influence was not financial it was influenced from the person who could get up here and talk with a group of people and sway them with his and i want to use the word opinion but i know that is not right it he swayed them with a position that he had developed now that that is not necessarily his opinion is what i am trying to make a point there <laugh> he would sway them basically the influents that he had had from uh uh of various people within this community whether whether you are talking about a town ship or a county state whatever it may be and yes uh uh then putt slow probably then i think the finances came into play and finances have come to a horrible horrible situation as of the day i will tell you about this the the last two years it has because it is because it is rather specific right now but going back it two years or four years they go finances were still a very very heavy consideration and not not just on the uh national level but i am saying even on the local levels i know within the immediate community there are people out there uh hey come on we will go to dinner we will go to this and we will do this and do this just just barely barely breaking uh the barrier but not breaking the law uh so yes very definite progressively has changed 

Recording: (6384/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6385/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (6386/ 9621) 
i i do not think anyone really effected anyone too too much as far as that goes 

Recording: (6387/ 9621) 
in the strange city i know oh my god 

Recording: (6388/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (6389/ 9621)

Recording: (6390/ 9621) 
oh yeah oh yeah i used to be when i first started teaching even up to sixth grade kids were pretty respectful 

Recording: (6391/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6392/ 9621) 
yeah they okay their parents they are in their seventies now <laugh> i i take what i need and leave them rest because they have got their own opinions that are a lot different than mine so 

Recording: (6393/ 9621) 
you know they do not understand the concept so they do not know any different of you know why did not we get to stay home they may later when they grow older but yeah but i still think you know they benefit it a lot from it now 

Recording: (6394/ 9621) 
i ever would have before 

Recording: (6395/ 9621)

Recording: (6396/ 9621) 
family experiences 

Recording: (6397/ 9621) 
yeah i mean i would want to see how the season ends out it is just a lot of the ones this season to me have just been disappointing the i mean i think every show is sort of has a peak some shows peek towards the end some at the beginning and sort of level off but uh the the simpsons had a stretch from a like their third year do you like their seventh where things were just like unbelievable funny and then they had some writing changes i think and this this season it is just it is been completly outrageous story lines and the jokes are not as integrated into the story 

Recording: (6398/ 9621) 
like it i did not feel something to mind 

Recording: (6399/ 9621) 
well they are now in a sense uh it is easier to go somewhere else i think in the way up on tv if you have you only for news for local news channels and they are all seeing the same thing and emphasized the same things there is no choice there if you want the news you are going to get it one way by the other but on the web even to somewhere else uh in you know the major newspapers are all over the web uh you have been picking choose and you can see different perspective on the same story from different parts of the country and i think you get a a wider view yeah 

Recording: (6400/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6401/ 9621) 
right <laugh> 

Recording: (6402/ 9621) 
years ago there was a citizen i do not know if you ever in you or what is your background is where you were it was here but you are not but citizen journal was the daily paper and it was it was the opposite of the respect was much more liberal they used this it it was a morning paper in the past was an afternoon paper evening paper and uh they shared the same facilities the same pretty many pressing and everything and then to spatch one of their lease experimented one and three new at least

Recording: (6418/ 9621) 
and that the the the people who who most face that lie are the supposed beneficial areas of civil rights legislation um so uh i mean civil rights was an an important step but once that step was made it was stopped and now i believe today they are are uh i mean it a see a growing movement of people who want to who curtail the advances that were made in the sixties and it is not our the reason who is curtailing it still the uh like our parents generation uh

not specifically no i sometimes if there is a college in a community when i was running a school heavy campaign uh um we would try to get them either registered and and active in a campaign um but it was very difficult it was sort of like getting people who live in in a trailer park active in voting and there is certain little blocks of people uh and on school levy is the people who voted no which are senior citizens i mean they they went to the polls and droves you did not have to you know the the hope there was that they would not go to vote <laugh> on the school of it uh but actually trying to get college kids involved i have not really specifically done that as a whole campaign in and of itself it might be a little pocket of a campaign but nothing big 

Recording: (6436/ 9621) 
no no they did not uh they did not pay for grading or preparing your classes or or searching anything <laugh> so right but but still even though it was a real a very much underpaid job i i liked it when i did it uh i liked the interdue to the arts class because i had to develop my own curriculum for it <laugh> right they had a when they told me i i they would hire me to teach this class they gave me a book that was about this stick and it was only about paint

Recording: (6514/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (6515/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6516/ 9621) 
ah okay okay it is probably growing up and i do not i have been there done that too but still you have to you have to um notice respect out there to be warranted and you expect it and not just demand it you got to you have to work to show respect and then you should get respect for it but then and they saw the interaction with the other people the school he went to there is a lot of public involvement public service required the teachers i often ask the teachers i have gone to sporting events and the teachers are there ticket takers uh monitoring a crowd where the kids uh and i said do you guys ever go home no no we ask them but they are always there they are not they are just teaching a class they are not there preparing the class they are the they are there for the student and they make the student feel part of the family that is a continuation of my philosophy at home we interact the school is great you have people that are on the clock whoop trying to quit they are gone those people put on the meaning of life they will never know the meaning of life but if they stay around try to extend themselves a little more with somebody that is having problems at work and are willing to work with that person i say willing to work not knowing they are going to be compensated because they will be compensated and then they say materialistically they will be been then or what is not expected they will be even really coming here somewhere but the thing is just laying and opening hand not knowing well gee what is for what is in it for me what is in it for you is intangible are you willing 

Recording: (6517/ 9621) 
i never thought of that 

Recording: (6518/ 9621) 
but i think kids in high school and stuff some of them like my brotherinlaw is day and when i met him i knew he was like you know he was the type some of me can not tell no it does not matter what they look like um but my husband said all through going out he liked men he did not like girls he looked at news magazines you know all this stuff and i thought that is so funny because growing up i just did not know know anybody that was uh but you know he was only gets his mother right from the beginning and she was from germany which made a little talk because you know they did not talk about that that those things over there at all for a long time but uh then she became very open with them and everybody knew and that was in the eighties and you know it is some kids know it when they are young and growing up you know i do not know if it is best to not to you know be open but if they are open to their parents about it then their parents are gonna deal with it a lot better than than if they wait later on and you know but sometimes i guess they change you know most of the men i knew right off the bat you know i mean i mean was it new it was all through their life it was not it though they just said oh i am going i am going to be okay 

Recording: (6519/ 9621)

if they hold you know enough of my views i am not going to vote for a woman just because they are a woman and i am not going to vote for a democrat just because they are a democrat they better have them you know at least and and i do not need a hundred percent uh agreement with my views but i would like they would be it in the ninety to ninety five percent range um but yeah uh i do not tend to vote straight party line either as i said i have i have moderated from when i was uh in college to today part you know the the aging process and also partly because i have i have noticed that to get things done you have to have a center and it is the center that tends to rule when i was in college um we had a bumper sticker that said america fix it or forget it and some of the construction people in dayton came out with one that that america love it or leave it uh and today i realize that both of those positions are wrong it is america love it and fix it just like with your kids you love your kids but you do not let them you know have bad matters at the table and you do not let them run around with the wrong you know kids and you want them to behave well you know that is how i see american now and and america become more centered uh and when it devates from that either way that is when people become upset um so i just think it is important i i remember when um who was the other president that i voted for that won carter uh black liters would meet with him once a week and then they would come out out and hold this press conference and complain about he did not do this for blacks he did not do that enough for blacks he did not do this and he did not do that and i used to say you know just some of my black friends do not you see what you are doing do not did you see the greater applications of this oh no we need to having moved faster i said you know that would be great in an ideal world this is not an ideal world you have to take it a step at a time whether you like it or not and to what you are going to do is you are going to make it look like he is so bad on all the issues you are going to give people a reason to vote against him then if any big issue comes up that is just going to be added to everything else and what you need to do is after you have this meeting with him is come out and raise him and he is doing a good job and they were moving along steadily uh and i you know i do not think sometimes people who do politics of the negative understand what it means um i made that mistake when i was president of the dayton education association we were trying to get a levy passed so we went around as teachers showing all of the bad conditions in the school all the working you know uh ceilings all of the peeling floors all the the the bad shock boardge with cracks in them and all that kind of stuff and it had the opposite effect of what we thought people thought the schools were so bad they said we are not going to support those and they voted no so the next time we did an opposite check we went in and we said you know eighteen months later on the board put another um about uh levy on the the ballet we said these are great school we have great teachers look at this kid he is learning to read he is made six months improvement in three months and all that time it was in age and we we are saying the same thing you know we want to continue this we want to make even this better um we learn to say the negative is in a positive way in that is important you know and and you need to get that that you you need to appeal to the center americans do not like extreme liberals they do not like extreme conservative you know they they what they want peace <laugh> 

Recording: (6647/ 9621) 
oh gosh 

Recording: (6648/ 9621)

Recording: (6659/ 9621) 
well i think a little bit safer idea than uh eliminating guns because you know there is always going to be weapons out there instead of eliminating the problem you know more centralized it make it a national law they have to be a certain age give certain time period for your background checks and whatever else kind of record finding they need make sure your you know you know not going to just go out and close to might as head off for no reason you are keeping it for you know just either security reasons hunting reason or practice you know but

Recording: (6733/ 9621) 
and just you know sort of doing the same old same old every day there was always something different i guess to be outside and it is just a lot easier to do 

Recording: (6734/ 9621) 
it is more our society than the guns i believe it is more the person that would have the gun than the gun itself 

Recording: (6735/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6736/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6737/ 9621)

um-hum 

Recording: (6740/ 9621) 
and every night you just get there right the regular rooms are still nice and they have showers and stuff but it is interesting because the way they advertise it they make it sound like there is this huge place and you are going to get that no matter what and that is the night but when you actually go and look around it kind of 

Recording: (6741/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6742/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6743/ 9621) 
yeah and yeah and i would not do it i if i was you know had no children and 

Recording: (6744/ 9621) 
so you know um it it is pretty pretty busy there but it it spread out over the sixteen hours as far as poor climates sometimes you have like maybe seventy five eighty eight airplains in an hours time so

Recording: (6746/ 9621) 
and they are like wow let us do this too we can make school you know let out for a little bit i they might not be doing it to um 

Recording: (6747/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (6748/ 9621) 
boy i you know i i do not have a kid and then you know not being that close to it it is hard to know i mean i have always i have always thought that that um what their friends did and what they what they were exposed to at home had as much influences as they anything that that the school could do but i know the school schools are very powerful forth in the kids life you know i mean it is the kids life 

Recording: (6749/ 9621) 
well it is kind of hard you would see he is got two other kids and one kid he had while we was together they he does not see at all 

Recording: (6750/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6751/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6752/ 9621) 
well how he felt and knowing that we were not neglecting him of two different things we have always emphasized that knowing once right i would knowing that what is just is one thing is dealing with the emotions is another one 

Recording: (6753/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6754/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6755/ 9621) 
no not at all i would have rather vote him from a can but over bush because bush he he comes from a political family which i am not saying he is wrong because the kennedys were very big political family but i am saying like bush is um he just seems like he did not really like he everything is been handed to him in the nice and uh the issue of like whether did drugs that is that is a big issue but i do not like the way he interested you know that to me just if he did drugs okay everyone my experiment or try or make a mistake but the way he is handling it saying i am not even going to they did not find that question over it over it over if he did not do it he might as well just be like no i did not do it 

Recording: (6756/ 9621) 
no <laugh> actually i was uh going to get my ged after that 

Recording: (6757/ 9621) 
yeah with all the controversy about that and the police um-hum uh i do not know it is north and it is such uh a good location for all the people around there and it is certainly not you know um um a hurting day or you know a neighborhood that people do not need in their slathers everywhere their sears everywhere or not why not having both places i mean i would not particularly go up to players if they take northland but we are not planning on staying there anyway so i did not yeah will probably move within a year um-hum 

Recording: (6758/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (6759/ 9621)

Recording: (6761/ 9621) 
i can not get back to being at home did your mother give you everything he want then she failed you did not she 

Recording: (6762/ 9621) 
and of course i think too uh in america the uh the farm families you know they wanted that was more labor for the then you are so to dek so i think that might have influenced a lot of that but over the years it it uh it just made sense to me in fact it looks like a my family that they are going to the children are going to be mostly in two you know not even going to three or four i mean it is not over yet but my girls are forty two and forty one soon to be forty one so uh i think that their childbearing years are over 

Recording: (6763/ 9621)

att attention deficit high product of it is order 

Recording: (6767/ 9621)

Recording: (6921/ 9621) 
well i know it was myself when we had he would always said that it was not for me he would have gotten just too amused in his job because he is really involved you know he likes what he is doing his tremendous of responsibility and but he loves it but the thing is when the kids were little too you know i was always having to pull him back and say do not forget you know they are gonna for real fast if you if you do not spend this time and now i mean like i said the youngest is thirteen and so he is been at this for all these years and i do not have to do that anymore more i mean some place along the way about ten years ago he got so involved in their lives but when they are little 

Recording: (6922/ 9621) 
usually go out to lunch at like some fast food place and then we get together and cook dinner

Recording: (6933/ 9621) 
right well not just one my older brother would have been two and a half or three 

Recording: (6934/ 9621) 
you know i think i i just think that typically you see a lot of people lot of places that are that are under construction not very many people working there 

Recording: (6935/ 9621) 
because i was going to be opening up on the sixth um looking forward to doing that we had a um uh seasons past two way into the pools but a lot of times the pools um different from centers on our different rec centers the y programs are excellent even here at a high state they have got the um um recreational sports on sunday out asternes where they can go uh we go to the zoo a lot library have story times reading hours those type of things uh oh kinds of community things easter egg hunts at the recs centers 

Recording: (6936/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (6937/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6938/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (6939/ 9621) 
i think so 

Recording: (6940/ 9621) 
discipline i would be screamed that made to get jumped on the floor to do push ups i mean it was it was 

Recording: (6941/ 9621)

Recording: (6942/ 9621) 
retire yeah 

Recording: (6943/ 9621) 
that was all on it 

Recording: (6944/ 9621) 
that is exactly how i mean when you say what would i do you know i might to a house and i might just go to school some i used to own a gallery i might do something like that again you know there is just like there is just zillions of projects out there waiting to happie and so it is just 

Recording: (6945/ 9621) 
it is just the spirit the spiritual aspect there is around even onlstein the most brilliant man supposedly mathematics of our time uh even said that there will be people or should be people come along with better theories than he has yet but nobody is taking the time or made the time to challenge this area 

Recording: (6946/ 9621) 
that would probably affect my decision a little bit 

Recording: (6947/ 9621) 
yeah that guy at spring break a couple of teachers who are taking a bunch of kids 

Recording: (6948/ 9621) 
uh will goes on uh you know nationally you know especially interested in the presidential election 

Recording: (6949/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6950/ 9621) 
do not you think 

Recording: (6951/ 9621) 
but then they have one injury and then what are they going to do they got to think of that they have a free education and they just do not think of it that way you know they think they can make enough money and but you know 

Recording: (6952/ 9621) 
and also at the show of hands gallard is 

Recording: (6953/ 9621)

Recording: (6955/ 9621) 
um-hum oh station uh purtue station was in north carolina 

Recording: (6956/ 9621) 
yeah he they could afford to go there so they did not 

Recording: (6957/ 9621) 
and they got 

Recording: (6958/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6959/ 9621) 
okay yeah sure i that is okay 

Recording: (6960/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (6961/ 9621) 
aconfire them because they are gave i could care less 

Recording: (6962/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (6963/ 9621) 
so how i this works out you know i do not know i just i am just like okay she just says i just want to get it over with and see now she you know 

Recording: (6964/ 9621) 
well her major is communications it did not start out that but my daughter wants to write books again wow <laugh>

Recording: (6966/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (6967/ 9621) 
her mother did not want to see it and everything we were divorced at the time and uh then i went and bought the movie and 

Recording: (6968/ 9621) 
and then how so as far as that to them when you have a chance to talk to them that is what we need to learn more from interview have more meaningful interviews of these people so that we can learn from them i put them up the we do not want to get the negative answer because all my heard the image of the university oh gee now uh we who was it cats and lawyers i oh yeah well hey we realize that the university only wants players who draw gate money that is all they want to do they do not have back doingings they do not talk about that actually i am interested in the united states 

Recording: (6969/ 9621) 
the teacher was there one day and she was pregnant with twins and the second day she was in the hospital um those things happen 

Recording: (6970/ 9621) 
it was 

Recording: (6971/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6972/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6973/ 9621) 
a lot of people have switch from being like the really quiet more reserved people to the party animal 

Recording: (6974/ 9621) 
um i would kind of say most people i know are at least fairly ethical i mean there is no more sentencing groups in the other that i know 

Recording: (6975/ 9621) 
eventually 

Recording: (6976/ 9621) 
<laugh> he worked he 

Recording: (6977/ 9621) 
um i think so i think partial birth is not such a big issue because i mean it hardly ever comes up but i with so many things it is it is like a it is a point and the door if we can do that then we can say well you know maybe not in the third try master and then we can say well not in the second try master and 

Recording: (6978/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (6979/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6980/ 9621) 
i have almost bit here i do not know how many times people talking on telephones i see people turn them in the turn themselves 

Recording: (6981/ 9621) 
there there is a way back to access to some of our system that is all of them were putting them more uniform one up for everything and i do not it may be they oh it should have it is own system but they can also connect to our system for things they do not have in their system and it is so i am not sure what system you are talking about 

Recording: (6982/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (6983/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6984/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6985/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (6986/ 9621) 
yeah yeah yeah you can not ignore it i mean because you know because that is something else when i was in high school i do not think i knew the word but uh um now everybody knows uh i am anybody who is a little bit different is likely to be called the jag <laugh> and and so it is better if you can and devused that but i boy i would not know how to approach it i mean i think it should be approached but ooh i would not have a clue 

Recording: (6987/ 9621) 
<laugh> they let you know like five hundred people in electrical yeah 

Recording: (6988/ 9621) 
um yeah uh two thirty seven uh 

Recording: (6989/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (6990/ 9621) 
the united states knows about it they can not sit there and they will pay the welfare they will not do nothing to him 

Recording: (6991/ 9621) 
<laugh> right real warm <laugh> 

Recording: (6992/ 9621) 
right and it is all the bucks yeah because people i work with you know uh there are there are some people i work with that have house payments one guy he has the biggest twenty two hundred dollars a month and a lot of them have like fifty hundred and up and you know i bought my house years and years ago and it is like four eighty five and i would not dare tell them that but it is like you know they because they are always you know they have people there that make a lot more money than i do and and they are always like broke but yet you know like when they go do something they have got to have the the best of everything the best of it it is like you know you know uh to me you just have to kind of think about things little bit and it is like you know do i do i really need to go to uh um what would i say um uh tga fridays for lunch and spend twelve dollars we are going to taco bell and spend like three and use the other part for maybe like a book for my kid or you know uh they have like my daughter is in swimming i need the money for a swim suit well why do not i use it for that you know so its 

Recording: (6993/ 9621) 
because it is more open uh and you couch it in terms of civil rights uh my boyfriend is thinks it is wrong morally but does not think we ought to be discriminating against and he he thinks it is a sin therefore he thinks they should repent in the way to do that as through you know talk into them religion wise um i do not think it is the same i think it uh your sexuality is gene c based in that i you can no more change your sexual orientation than you can the color of your eyes or your hair you may put a die on it or you may put a different uh whatever those eye pieces bizar tax i do not wear glasses so i can ever remember those terms um but that is just cosmetics and anyone who tries to change your sexual orientate initish and that is cosmetics too uh and again my belief is whatever happens between considering adults is their business not mine um so i do not know that anyone could change it uh what was your question again 

Recording: (6994/ 9621) 
uh wander around to look at things 

Recording: (6995/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6996/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6997/ 9621) 
oh it is got to come from the top uh you know i i just found like there was just a total lack of interest in the student from from every direction so i would say you know it is an organizational problem and no you know no motivation uh you know to do their job you know properly now i live down the street from what they call cause it is a columbus uh alternative high school and uh you get there through a lottery system and they have the best reputation of all the columbus schools and uh those kids leave there getting full scholarship uh uh my son went there one year uh it was a disaster for him 

Recording: (6998/ 9621) 
yeah they are of a pro strike we getting plenty of in book ideas but you know 

Recording: (6999/ 9621) 
a bad one or a good one 

Recording: (7000/ 9621) 
so it is been a lot of pressure there 

Recording: (7001/ 9621) 
and uh a disease that affected her mind and of course you know back then i did not really know that but there was a lot of conflict 

Recording: (7002/ 9621) 
yeah it was yeah it was interesting 

Recording: (7003/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7004/ 9621) 
flip me out 

Recording: (7005/ 9621) 
and how can you do that 

Recording: (7006/ 9621) 
i mean i did not get the greatest chance as i do not think any of us they really had the best you know but but i do not i have been talking to my kid to the way of some of these people talk to her eight maybe zips or something like that and she wanted to sit here a mommy so she made her sit with her it was this cool and mama just goes to sleep and little kid is trying to study her homework you know for i do not know was he up on that party and was he up on that work anyhow or what the hell was your problem 

Recording: (7007/ 9621) 
i do not really see anybody i was totally ready to vote for a husband though and then she opened her mouth and things came out and <laugh> uh she had the best chance at a any uh any woman that is ever run for president and she was in a major party which has not happened before and it would have been really it would happen to bob dole over it you know it would be the first man after having run to the office 

Recording: (7008/ 9621)

my person do not believe they should be allowed to because i believe they they should have the male is it the you know the gentleman for a proper pretty you know 

Recording: (7011/ 9621) 
you know i think a lot of it depends on i do not know for to different parts of the country but cultures and everything because you know it just seems and uh some the parts of the midwest but maybe kentucky and wally seems grows down there and a lot of them get married so young they just that is just what they want to do you know they do not but they are not thingsing i have any future wanting to go to college or anything like that i am sorry <laugh> i do not be like 

Recording: (7012/ 9621)

Recording: (7025/ 9621) 
yeah she does everybody over by her hospital 

Recording: (7026/ 9621) 
to mary them and she moved over and 

Recording: (7027/ 9621) 
i mean as old as i am i still got that against them and that is what i i want my you know my son that keep i want him to know his father and be around them and that is not the best best a person but you know 

Recording: (7028/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (7029/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7030/ 9621) 
but see that is not proved out by the the approval rating he still has higher approval rating than reagan had in his last eighteen months so you know people still like what he what he is done i think that that um that you know people do not like all the crap that went with him is the pundance on tv you know they say that and they are they are still trying to get him i mean before or he was even elected they were trying to get him which is what they would have done to a visible door they would not have been able to attack on the issue so they would find other things to get get around so they stuburbing out all these women and all that stuff on and most people did not care about it they did not care about it before the election they did not care about it during his campaign they did not care about it during his presum some republican right wing i do not know what who are just trying to make an issue out of nothing it was not watergate you know he may have been a cat you know he may have uh but he was twenty one it is not like it was someone who could make up her own mind what she wanted to do you and he may have been stupid in a cad but i do not wanna know about it on day one when it hits the news i did not wanna know about it and on the end when he was you know not in people i i did not wanna know about it and in between i did not wanna know about it and they just kept angering me because there were other things i wanted the government to do and this congress is the worst i have ever seen and not getting anything done and not really being able to be on the loss of of where america is on such issues as gun control and women is rights and and things that are important to people you know they they try to make suda issues out of clinton and then they try to make a suda issue out of you know giving a tax cut people do not want a tax cut when it is going to affect their social the the deficit 

Recording: (7031/ 9621) 
yeah but yeah um i think the mother has more of a instinct for that but as far as the studies go or the people roll over in their babies i do not see how you could roll over on anything that size and not know it unless you were on drugs or drunk or whatever you know what i mean 

Recording: (7032/ 9621) 
um i would like to teach um the the field is particularly decorated right now so i am not holding out hope for a teaching job i mean i would like to think that i couldoniaish myself within the field and get a job but i mean right now those jobs simply are not available so uh i am a person is approaching things like whatever happens happens i am going to pursue my interest and then go on from there rather than necessarily thinking about career plans after i finish my schooling 

Recording: (7033/ 9621) 
that is awfully young but again he is got this baby yet they did not talk about how this baby how you make a baby or everything is this and i do not know if they should be talking about that yet but here he is with this baby and it is just like okay 

Recording: (7034/ 9621) 
oh dear 

Recording: (7035/ 9621) 
definitely i definitely the way i feel that that is only is wrong but uh i do not know people always like oh you know if your mother if your mother where it kills god forbid but like you would want to death penalty but honestly i do not think i would i really like i would feel angry towards that person but killing them would does not help me with money maybe the family state helps with the closing and everything but i that to me is it is misplacing my anger in a way that actually i do not think the my victim that was so close to me would want me to do you know so 

Recording: (7036/ 9621) 
and uh then while she was out there she met a cowboy who was from also from oil and uh they uh they were married they were out there i guess but uh she was <laugh> this is my son he is he she was a piece of war you she had not different ideas about it put it over everything

Recording: (7074/ 9621) 
so it is kind of it is kind of hard when you are looking at the the oil did you watch that debate

Recording: (7077/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7078/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7079/ 9621) 
in 

Recording: (7080/ 9621) 
um-hum but there is things that are difficult like they are just that where we go we we have a temple too and they can not go in the temple well they can but they have to fit certain criteria they have to be advertised and not involved with all these health codes and all the different codes and but that is not what they are interested in doing so and and that is hard i think in like going on and just really they did not understand that they are my god just like they know how small you are they are saying he used i would be area and so 

Recording: (7081/ 9621) 
well when you think about the different generations and things we certainly did not have the things to worry about that people do now even i was in elementary and junior high been ever dreamed of anybody having a good gun even let alone a knife i mean that and that is violence and that is that goes back to kids and how much time in in effort you put into them you know kids are ignored and pushed aside and they are in the way and there is so many people that do not even want them and you know and then they get into school and they get violent and they they take it out you know and everybody is surprised you know i am not because i know there is a lot of anger and a lot of hate for these little kids and um and going to school it is going to be so dangerous i think because you have so many of them in one little room and they are coming from so many different background and even take each one of their situations and i can bet the statistics as time goes on that they they are not gonna have one caring parent you know maybe not even one of their parents you know they might have a foster family or you know somebody that wants to pretend like they care you know there is a lot of the people that that are foster families that only want them money you know and and there is all that so it is it is really scary and i think i think that it something has to be done real fast i do not know what i think it starts from what we teach them and as adults what we allow to be out there the computers i mean oh my gosh i did not even get a computer because i was so afraid you know what they could be able to access they was not you know there was nothing barred at all when they first came out yeah and you know where are all those software people and they are not responsible for way to care they are not responsible for you know all this internet access to all this stuff so it is really hard

Recording: (7119/ 9621) 
um originally on the more side 

Recording: (7120/ 9621) 
people who just uh really want to teach as opposed to like i do not know why other people like even going into teaching at all you know but um i think i would have just making it more like not so impersonal not so this is you know you do this to get this certain grades like you do this to learn this because it is interesting as opposed to like and i do not know i think it is like there is a lot of things that it is more compulsive education is weird like being forced to take this course like i think that if i i mean i mean it is good to being forced to take abroad like a liberal arts thing because like you do not know what you want i want to do so it is like if like you hate math and you do not take it at all but then you so i do not want to do something to math and you are like screwed like can not go back 

Recording: (7121/ 9621) 
i do not know to that much detail but most of the time it comes down to the lack of uh knowing your children are going to react and certain things oh what it is uh i i do not know details or thing other than the fact that they were it seemed like they were on amby news going on uh with them and uh and i think that is part of the problem we have in our in our lawn i five uh i it would be very difficult um i think um in our in traveling if you say okay i am going to give up this life here and go to the third world and live or less too less me less reverse busting hey okay up around arlington you live northwest side one she could only live on the east side

oh yeah 

Recording: (7127/ 9621)

Recording: (7154/ 9621) 
i 

Recording: (7155/ 9621) 
well you have to 

Recording: (7156/ 9621)

Recording: (7157/ 9621) 
oh they are very good they call i usually just call and then i walk down and by the time i get there the subject ready 

Recording: (7158/ 9621) 
the problem is lack of commitment the lack of commitment and i am saying hey there is an issue for you you can not be a mail oh yeah you want to do the operation i can not even yeah they want to why not be happy what you are god made you what you are why not make you the complete person you are and not strife or something you can not be

um-hum 

Recording: (7160/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (7161/ 9621) 
it is a real different thing i mean you can understand why it would be more pleasant for him to be at work all those hours when you know you have these little babies cry and all this stuff going on but he used to always he would come home from work and then go back to work after they were in bed so that i would not have to deal with it the whole time 

Recording: (7162/ 9621) 
um but good luck it back 

Recording: (7163/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (7164/ 9621) 
it is 

Recording: (7165/ 9621) 
i would like to see that implemented something like that in the united states that would be a neat thing you know because like i know like iron boundaries and uh from like like the oh we are paying jobs like they hire them a literate and things like that and they can not they give pay checks out on thursdays because everyone will call off on fridays because they will go out and get drunk i do not know what they do with their pay checks i know that is a big big problem 

Recording: (7166/ 9621) 
you know when i knew about age twelve thirteen <laugh> luckily i was not that early but uh i think once they start you know like sixth grade they really should relate to them 

Recording: (7167/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (7168/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7169/ 9621) 
and and it it is kind of weird because he when i went from middle school to high school it was like a big growing up period and i see them like what are you doing that for 

Recording: (7170/ 9621) 
right tuesdayay wednesday and thursday every night 

Recording: (7171/ 9621) 
now they are oh that is that is that she probably likes them well they were they were like her green kids so that is 

Recording: (7172/ 9621) 
yeah that that is one of the drawbacks 

Recording: (7173/ 9621) 
no i knew i would not change my mind on that either i am pretty strong willed about that 

Recording: (7174/ 9621) 
but uh everybody in my family is mechanical in quite 

Recording: (7175/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (7176/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7177/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7178/ 9621) 
i would get more people asking me for that and the mean it turns out pretty nice to make end about ten or eleven bucks an hour 

Recording: (7179/ 9621) 
yeah i do not think i could vote for a violent president i could vote for a president that made some mistakes with their personal life 

Recording: (7180/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (7181/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7182/ 9621) 
well i thought it went the way it was supposed to go <laugh> 

Recording: (7183/ 9621) 
oh before they just drink 

Recording: (7184/ 9621) 
and he could see uh an assuming he is educated not stupid otherwise he would not be a man is rate could see that that person did that 

Recording: (7185/ 9621) 
um about yeah the weekenders we have had her for two years yeah we did about six months we went to hawaii and got his brother married and then when we came back we need to that would be the last long trip um we were going to wait till this spring but we could not so we went to rescue service and got our 

Recording: (7186/ 9621) 
i mean most men are dogs yeah 

Recording: (7187/ 9621) 
um but that is kind of it it you know kind of came through where they were like uh when i was growing up we had a uh the any edge of jobs and everything of course and the edge of uh which uh we were called dead you know uh and i was kind of like in the middle you know have i played a little bit bord you know have also associated with them and they were basically pot head you know and everything so uh so i could say i you know i was kind of associated with both of them but then the football players you know some of them were uh pretty uh you put especially up there got scholarship and stuff you know there they could be real uh nasty but uh i just because i do not know i just think maybe they they look looking at it back is like uh oh i have got into arguments with the people in the plant seem later on you know and and it is like eight and uh it bite it bigger you know or whatever you know it is hard to forget what happened we were uh she is had five years ago you know i try to forget get things that you know i mean my mind is getting up to this war you know without worrying about uh which i do worry quite a bit about things but uh about stupid stuff huh like that can not even somebody gets mad at you because you are uh you are uh you are not a jockey you know you are you are you are you are this or you are that you know they are by trying to label people and stuff 

Recording: (7188/ 9621) 
i 

Recording: (7189/ 9621) 
they think everything they say is hilarious oh it is just middle school i think it is rest conditioning from childhood to childhood is a tough time and um when you have all the other things going on like you can not read and you can not write and you can not spell then it is just even worse it is it is an a to even more so i get the ones that everybody else throws out of their class 

Recording: (7190/ 9621) 
i think outside of the honors program a lot of it is but within the honors program i think there is some really really acceptable things going on 

Recording: (7191/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7192/ 9621) 
and it is very hard in my wife is not it but we will get through it 

Recording: (7193/ 9621) 
yeah you learn to know her <laugh> 

Recording: (7194/ 9621) 
yeah and they are also different but he he deals it real well with people so he is really and he is even thinking of going into uh business for himself yeah he almost did that this here in any fat and i do not wanna look at it so he is like the top guy of of the people that he works for so 

Recording: (7195/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (7196/ 9621) 
i do hope that she does she has a good writer i do hope that you know someday she can be able to do that 

Recording: (7197/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (7198/ 9621) 
yeah and people do not 

Recording: (7199/ 9621) 
yeah and i was really young when i met my husband i was fourteen in high school so we kind of grew up together and i did not know anything else and uh just two complete different people you know different needs and everything else so 

Recording: (7200/ 9621) 
oh you did not 

Recording: (7201/ 9621) 
do not do as much 

Recording: (7202/ 9621) 
and he is very opinionated and it is interesting when he talks about uh anything he loves to talk about politics and social issues and that sort of thing um you can tell that he is the thought is the thought about it and is you know clearly uh what his stance on it and he is very getting by without it uh sometimes it his responsible are not mature but he is nineteen 

Recording: (7203/ 9621) 
s only time for money yeah 

Recording: (7204/ 9621) 
well obviously i sort of surrounded that because i have been you know i spent a lot of time there since then i think had i only studied that for a semester or a quarter i would have come back with a completely different attitude but i was there for a whole year so the first few months we are a little bit difficult but then you know after that you know you just sort of you know get to the point where you just kind of uh you know laugh it off and just think uh here we go again and then 

Recording: (7205/ 9621) 
some ideal ideas about it so i am i figure it is something i should know about so <laugh> 

Recording: (7206/ 9621) 
a doctorate is different uh more um-hum i think though that one adoption is entirely different than when you conceived or somebody else is whatever uh because adoption means that i can not have any children or i see a child over here that need help and here you are reaching out to your friend is neighbor you are not just forgetting about it and let the welfare somebody take care of them and let them go down the drain and i think that that is what it bog in and and you are really accepting this responsibility and this love and well you are trying and willing to have oh some people will probably argue about this but i am sorry if god did not mean that i can see even have my own child why should i try to plant somebody else is inside i mean i would rather go out and see this other child that really needs needs it to help adopt that baby because you can see them and you can help them and you are already aware to a certain extent of what jeans they might have inherited from what problems you might be getting sometimes you do not put it later on you will find out but still you can go back and you can find a parent and i do not know whether they are going to be able to trace these i mean back and say you know later on if something happens to this child you are having and find out well what did they inherited over here but if you have adopted a child you can go back and you can find it out and onop the child better 

Recording: (7207/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7208/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7209/ 9621) 
he knows you know they show picture one oh that is who made you or something you know 

Recording: (7210/ 9621) 
well we do not wanna know she is the only one that wants to do her her uh boyfriend he does not wanna know either so they are decided that she could not go and find out the sake of it because she could to keep it safe right yeah so so anyhow we do not we just do not know 

Recording: (7211/ 9621) 
um i do not know if there could be there are certain programs different community based programs getting but again those are my values of those and say it is during the kids into a church based program if they can not be there putting them with um families and friends they you know and try to to look after them giving them the kinds they need the ymca programs are wonderful they give them a structured activity to do where they are supervised but again those programs a lot of times cost money that the families do not have and it may not be their value to put them in those type of programs 

Recording: (7212/ 9621) 
german yeah 

Recording: (7213/ 9621) 
i do not think we need eight months then we need to start the campaign even a year before the primary it is just too long uh people start tune out and there is only so much you can say and it is like the

Recording: (7219/ 9621) 
when in the fifties and sixties you very seldom saw black people on tv and then you started seeing a couple of black people on tv and then there was the getversians and although i found the getvers sons of fence to the many ways because it was stereotypical and made fun of of of black people in many ways and retrospect it was trend setting and what it did and and even in putting and blacks in uh advertisements on tv young kids saw them uh and and saw those ads and saw those tv programs into became a a part of everyday life and the more you see something the more it becomes more acceptable to maybe that is having in fact maybe fifty years from now we will look back on those tv programs and think they were trend setting instead of stereotypical um but i am sure it does have uh some influence because it i think it did it it was not the only thing that had an influence but it was one of the little pieces of the puzzle that that helps i think matthew shepherd helped also 

Recording: (7220/ 9621) 
right i think teaching band might be fun because i think you only ever got a satisfaction or unsatisfied in band and had mostly to do with whether you were there <laugh> whether you were well behaved yeah whether you are trying to play your instrument <laugh> i i do not think we ever got a is in season <laugh> yeah

their day care oh i do not know it is tough i think really i believe more in that large corporations need to have some kind of day care offered it is just there is not that many people anymore that can afford to have a one income family i mean you know we could do it you you know but you know we would not live as nice as we do we would not have as nice a cars as we do you know we would struggle a little more so so it is a toss up it is a real 

Recording: (7296/ 9621) 
well he he is yeah he taught math but they had a general curriculum just like he taught seventh grade they gave him math science um supposedly social the studies all the stuff that i mean it was just it was very poorly run to begin with so we would go out and try and find books for the kids i did not know if you heard that they he had not bought them books and so we had to buy them and uh i mean they got reimbursed but it was just ridiculous so they were trying to do anything they could and just to keep their jobs and keep the school 

Recording: (7297/ 9621)

Recording: (7304/ 9621) 
and poor people can not do that um so after all of a sudden on with her case she was left with about a million dollars and then out of that the attorney and the firm got a third plus she had to pay office expenses so really she was probably let with only about three hundred thousand dollars which have used wisely okay maybe she could have but it sounded to me like she did not have a money problem anyway she was a corporate person uh but a very stupid person um um so i mean that is basically my my down with the legal system i you know i have i have got a person right now that owes me five hundred dollars that i i wanted to take small claims court i even got the call uh a canceled check to prove it and everything but you know uh and one of i look at what the alternative is which is subjecting myself to uh unfairness uh even though i feel i got a concrete no way you know those are the ones i mean i would have to pay an attorney in that she was running am fine right now a hundred and forty five dollars an hour 

Recording: (7305/ 9621)

um-hum 

Recording: (7328/ 9621) 
uh i do not know i do not remember 

Recording: (7329/ 9621) 
i mean i think he is done some kinds of things that whole thing about uh as far as like your student loan and being able to get into <laugh> that just helps me you know oh and i think you know all this that as far as some of the issues go i think that that i feel pretty similar to the way he does um some of his foreign policy i think i have gone pretty decently but i mean i think i do not i do not know i mean i i do not know if it really really if you really feel like the that whole health care thing which nothing ever happened with really you know and i think these people have a lot of really great ideas but they do not they do not ever really put anything in the action it just kind of skied along you know and i do not know if there is anything so i can say that was a wonderful thing that you said that i feel very affected by it um economy is fine i mean so it is not that he is not uh doing a horrible job but i do not really know how much he is actually doing you know and i think that unfortunately they spend a lot of your time trying to get out of out of personal issues that you have got yourself into and you can not really focus us on anything that is that is positive that you want to do for for the country and i think i think it is just too bad because i feel like if i was president you know i thought i would want to be president but you know you would have three or four things that you would think were very important union t hire a lot of other people to take care of the other areas and people that were very comedyous that you feel like they would actually be able to accomplish them things and you have really worked you and get some stuff done you know and i do not know if it is if it is just because you know you have to get agreement from all the other all the everybody else in government before you can pass anything or why you know why do not these things get taken in care of i mean there is so many different issues that people want to look at and they end up focusing on things they still up more if you know just like that i guess thing in the whole world you know and and there is so many other things that i think you could be looked it they are they are important i just i do not know maybe i mean i do not i do not i am not real up on everything that is been done they i guess it just kind of seems like i wish people would be a little bit more focused in and you would be able to say you know this is what there is these three things that i think are really important and then i am really going to work to make sure that they get taken care of and and i do not i just think people kind of lot it i said well this is it is like this you know well see what we can kind of do about it and then we will you know oh 

Recording: (7330/ 9621) 
well see my my husband would do that though it is so bizarre because it is i do not know what i i honestly do not i think that is where his brain is completely like he i mean i get make all the decision that my house about discipline and about what people can do and can not do and we all understand this and it is perfectly fine and he says been not a good judge of that you will have to check it because my son well my son was like eleven he let him come to campus with his game boating friends i said where are they oh they said they were going down on i said on campus oh my dead buddy you know he is not allowed down there 

Recording: (7331/ 9621) 
i listen to someone i just touch someone will be successful you will be successfullyly individual individual and that is what is most critical you yourself has to do it not the business because from you businesses observe 

Recording: (7332/ 9621) 
and we know that the results could be death than like in it in it is an aggressive an aggressian thing one side will be the aggressive one would obviously because you can not have two uh to aggressive things uh uh naturally one would be aggressive and then one would be aggressive in its for spots you can not you know what i mean so it and like a state of war it was like that so in that context i think but like in the same context i feel that it would be wrong for a soldier to kill civilian because they did not um they did not decide to become a combat and so if you are if you are a combat and then you make that decision or you are drafted which that that is kind of like making this decision in the sense that you were part of that society that got you drafted so if you choose before that society then i mean that is a little shadeier but still if you are if you both make the the desire to do it then so like if i were drafted i think i would fight i am sure i would fight for the country you know but i do not think i would go think you know i just do not feel the need to go on a rampage or anything 

Recording: (7333/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7334/ 9621) 
<laugh>

Recording: (7396/ 9621) 
are not really saying much new but if they have a more compact time they could be so i would like the season see the time reduced the conventions used to be interesting because they the did the platform that is all settled now and it is just sort of this you know this sunab man type stuff well that is not interesting oh it could change them who the primary is like to be 

Recording: (7397/ 9621)

Recording: (7400/ 9621) 
hm 

Recording: (7401/ 9621) 
there was an indam story about that i think it was i do not know it was harper is magazine or what it was in a a a significant magazine where they had uh made a study of the new york situation and i found that quite interesting and very very impressive uh as a matter of fact ever was our member sending it into the uh city council uh uh update you know just addressed 

Recording: (7402/ 9621) 
they she is you know half naked and she is should be a central somewhere you know and those are little yeah disney movies cartoons i mean when you look at that you see it everywhere and it is really scary um but nobody is doing anything about it that i can see and they do not really see a concern but like i said wait till the generation starts growing up wait till those little kids that we have put all those things in their head grows up then they will think wow we should have done something uh i know well i am i am scared i hope i do not live real long <laugh> it is it is scary well and then the guy that um i do not even remember what his name was he got a drunk driving charge a judge he was a judge now he is out he went back to work on monday 

Recording: (7403/ 9621) 
highly skilled or trained in that area i mean you can not really do a simple sort of screening and these are good and these are bad and again as i mentioned preverly i think it is more to do with maybe being aware of the interaction of you know the different students with each other and i am i mean if it was as bad as they claimed it to be or as it appears to be and i mean you are you are never going to get rid of all of that because they are always different groups and in different looks but i kept thinking that if it was bad enough that you would do something like that that you know had to have been more than just you know sort of normal jobs versus whatever so i think it should be more i do not know i mean even you know i went to uh private catholic high schools but even there you know there was you know a a sense of that and i mean some of the things that went on should definitely not i have been and going on and that was only on a very small lake they were eighty six people in my graduating class you know and i mean this is a high school with like several hundred students that just happened to it so 

Recording: (7404/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (7405/ 9621) 
you know i i said to myself because i had post part of them depression with my third and fourth child and i thought what good am i going to beat these children if i am not able to take care of them so the decision was that after the fourth child we would practice birth control so oh uh and i felt comfortable with that

Recording: (7407/ 9621) 
no sun light you know that and they do not give them they keep it warm and then he is not allowed sheets or raises or you know other an electric rais so he can not kill himself so you just bock there is nothing you could do all day for forty years or however eventually it naturally dies and that to me would be they got to me is actually like that has to be worse like just a aginy in the in the i think you would have to go on saying like there is really so much you i am down for board games or something but like you can not does not even hear human voice because i think it is something like that was reading the script that you are dead to the world for uh the worst that you can do and so the world season you know what i mean so that would be rough they would be real rough and so obviously he would want to um i like they say like now like people would observe him he is like things to himself and he reads the bible like every day and but they i do not know they would be strange if he is such a horrible thing to go through i could not imagine being like the room for like few days

nope i i i would not i will i will not send them to a college public school but an an alternative school i will send them to um i would if i had the money to use it sure is i would let definitely but i know i could not afford it that is why i have never bought about it really 

Recording: (7420/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7421/ 9621) 
yeah stay away from salt uh sod and stuff like that pop uh coffee i do not know if you have probably from there i do not drink coffee i drink a lot of pop though uh like pork plodd uh 

Recording: (7422/ 9621) 
wow that is great 

Recording: (7423/ 9621) 
and a lot of times unions uh they actually see actually see you know actually to production and to like the actual individual needs of the members of the union because if the if the enemy comes powerful you can feel free to call off and things like that and they that that can actually make it worse because then the corporation sees these lady uh lady union as a representative of of these workers so they are more apt to go outside 

Recording: (7424/ 9621) 
yeah that would not work <laugh> 

Recording: (7425/ 9621) 
um-hum right 

Recording: (7426/ 9621) 
i know that 

Recording: (7427/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7428/ 9621) 
but i do not think it is bad 

Recording: (7429/ 9621) 
so you know one day uh it was a really bad day i had gone like tole soclock home with somebody and came back and you know i i guess that i had that evening to eat the entire day and i it was like it was like midnight and i got home and i thought oh i am too hungry you know to i am too tired and hungry and i just thought i am not making anything so i just went to bed and uh a guy knocked on my door which he lives upstairs in the apartment above me and he talked to me or you are there and i would not answer well it was a real cheap apartment he took a credit card and punished the uh the doorknob and 

Recording: (7430/ 9621) 
actually i wore out 

Recording: (7431/ 9621) 
is that right the lot of all of these are these like little well down in high spots you know like uh just trying to keep them like a like a a seek it away from the taurus 

Recording: (7432/ 9621) 
gavegave homosexual and all those 

Recording: (7433/ 9621) 
a few times they they did a specifically say uh homosexuality but i mean there were other things that they would have uh i mean it is not like it is just uh all i just saw it on being getting or anything like that 

Recording: (7434/ 9621) 
within her her life they she she does more with the children because most of them live here you know our children are all away so 

Recording: (7435/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (7436/ 9621) 
i do not know i mean i think it is kind of ridiculous for kids to pay did you go them you know or if they get caught doing like d sales my all my cousins went to the new sales and if they got shut caught you and um they have their pay 

Recording: (7437/ 9621) 
yeah well like i mean high school schools always have been really easy and like in like high school it is really easy like i never really felt like challenge is doing are remotely by anything like i mean you know it was it was so like high school was kind of like a joke you know it was real fun and everything you know just to like i do not really have to do pretty much of anything you know and like um and like the college is a little bit different i mean it was like a little bit more challenged i mean it is basically the same thing in high school you should have less time to do the material you know so it is just like as opposed to i mean three weeks to doing the paper and doing it the night before three after three days to do it and you still do it the night before it is just like i do not know i thought i just kind of like found out like that i really do not like school and like i ever wanna go back can like have me to take come out have them to take come out classes again like i just was like is not really my thing like we in too like i always knew that this it would be like this you always have to take basic classes but like i was a history major and so it is like i do not care about math at all and like anything that i would do would be humanities or like so it is like 

Recording: (7438/ 9621) 
um-hum an all white jury 

Recording: (7439/ 9621) 
well i 

Recording: (7440/ 9621) 
and the questions are not easy i mean i mean uh i doubt if i could pass some of them i mean i probably could pass the citizens chip in the in the english and maybe the science because i like science when i keep up on that stuff but i doubt if i could pass them math because i do not teach math and i do not use math that much other than just normal you know add subtractable 

Recording: (7441/ 9621) 
uh i think they lost they go to the state lost because they just out there renting and leaving and after a while got out of hand i 

Recording: (7442/ 9621) 
bassacoustics really 

Recording: (7443/ 9621) 
that is different 

Recording: (7444/ 9621) 
i do not think we take up huge amount and then uh we get some of the service through or not as well which is i think it is just up late up in the they they give us the door and any name in the lot 

Recording: (7445/ 9621) 
like uh right now their biggest campaign is uh the some elementary school i believe and oh i think it was a high school in marion we have built on um in old weapons depot and so like leukemiaism and so like that is their main campaign now is going to form the public and trying uh get that changed they have also done other things uh other they they do anythings doing the environment uh like exposure uh things like that so 

Recording: (7446/ 9621) 
over on an adjoining hill oh about half a mile away i guess and he was getting even for the day before 

Recording: (7447/ 9621) 
yeah i 

Recording: (7448/ 9621) 
if it is not a necessity i will have to forward it right now well a lot of them want the necessities they also want some of the extras and in order do that both act to work what kind of one he was really raising the kids if they are lucky they have got a loving grandparents ninety nine times out of a hundred i do not know if that is a good statistic it is the babysitters or you know these places it is not a babysitter it is a babysitter school or something like that and that is not the same loving cutling atmosphere that it had when mom was home and able to watch her kids and i think that that is one of the things they can change plus the fact that they change the stupid tv programs because that is a terrible influence of a lot of kids is taking over their life if it is not that no it is worse yet it is because you are on the internet now that is even worse because now you can not even hear what they are getting into at least on tv you walk in the street and turn it off and you can go in and i guess and see what they are on the same to start and they are not that anymore but i think those are all really they can be good influences if they have got the right program the right person they are talking to but too many times it is the other way around 

Recording: (7449/ 9621) 
<laugh> yes exactly 

Recording: (7450/ 9621) 
i hate my my last name is terrible i hate my last name 

Recording: (7451/ 9621) 
well muggings on the subway or stuff you know just in general 

Recording: (7452/ 9621) 
just do not talk about other people talking just general things that i think you should take for granted 

Recording: (7453/ 9621) 
uh relax uh get a a dead end job that does not come home with me uh try and pay off my debt and maybe make a little bit so uh i i growsville yeah but also enjoy all the things i did not get to do 

Recording: (7454/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (7455/ 9621) 
well and they had to cover their i know all of that but i do not think that is really been 

Recording: (7456/ 9621) 
or or somebody or or they will claim to i wasus to the same about as i walked out the door you know and it is a big line 

Recording: (7457/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (7458/ 9621) 
well i know people at the sleep on the outside and uh but not all of them are better into the better thing but they they are again they do not want to be a part of the quote unquote sheltered system uh uh standing at an open shoulder if you are away or something like that 

Recording: (7459/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7460/ 9621) 
and there is lighting effects the extra blade is not the balls 

Recording: (7461/ 9621) 
yeah just so smart 

Recording: (7462/ 9621) 
i went to for grade school and for high school 

Recording: (7463/ 9621) 
or just to say this you know this is what i thought this that does that what that really says well here is a perfect example the other day my kids my sixth grade has turned in the paper is on if i could be an animal here is the animal i would be and here is why and they had to research the animal they had like a month to do it and they had to pick any animal and tell about about their feeding habits and their whether they travel in groups or alone and of what part of the world they mostly habitate what they eat all that okay perfect bample one of my students wanted to say my animal that i pick lives mostly on vegetables and he could not figure out how it is about so he went into the computer and he asked it and it gave him the word of vet abuse 

Recording: (7464/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7465/ 9621) 
oh man 

Recording: (7466/ 9621) 
so um 

Recording: (7467/ 9621) 
than i 

Recording: (7468/ 9621) 
exist area i mean they could actually well yeah they could actually make it to where they could put homeless people or something speedomers something 

Recording: (7469/ 9621) 
light news uh that is why i read it is tend to read alternative newspapers and stuff because you do get a different perspective it is probably just slanted but it is different they are right 

Recording: (7470/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7471/ 9621) 
i think so because i 

Recording: (7472/ 9621) 
which is um which is actually a good place for her because a lot of those houses like right around the park of roses and those types of things you can get some that are older that need that need a lot of work but that is a pretty high to man area 

Recording: (7473/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7474/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (7475/ 9621) 
okay that is why they do a lot of like biological studies is up everywhere okay i i have heard of it 

Recording: (7476/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (7477/ 9621) 
oh i had women that work in the fort you had women working before but selfdiscipline is a big family it is part of it selfdiscipline many things too easy for us oh we can not do a right you ever you ever try to work person i mean you really struggle to achieve something did it mean more to you than something that was given to you tell me 

Recording: (7478/ 9621) 
well i have a <laugh> maybe when i am i am a hundred i will have that figured out 

Recording: (7479/ 9621) 
then my sister lives in the middle of the past <laugh> nobody wants to <laugh> nobody wants to cut it <laugh> no grass yeah what is out there anyway come what is the cornstarch 

Recording: (7480/ 9621) 
because that is sort of what i found interesting there too i mean there are a lot of drives about that i remember um driving to germany with a couple of english friends and to visit some german we got there and it we would got lost and all these things it took us way long ago than it should have been a friend of the person we had been visiting said like oh why did you have this stop at every mcdonald is along the way and i was like i i do not even eat at mcdonald is you know and i was just you know and it was really mean it was like really a very good joke and that kind of thing came up quite frequently but you know i always said mcdonald is will not survive here if no one ate there and you can not tell me that everyone in there is american 

Recording: (7481/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (7482/ 9621) 
there well there is the whole thing about the police chief and then there is the whole thing about uh about the last the federal law against columbus 

Recording: (7483/ 9621) 
that is what we are concerned with you need to interact more people we need to interact more people every day of our life that is what we learn from we do not learn by giving things to people just like if you are uh a parent getting giving allowance you do not giving the your kids uh money to do chores they normally expect them to do but you get them to sing in addition to develop more responsibility but we do not talk about responsibility on society they i i i dearly the same we are in the heck they say public they this is our bill of responsibility do you know where there is do we talk about responsibility now 

Recording: (7484/ 9621) 
yeah and it is uh it is not too bad because i they scratch off your ticket games 

Recording: (7485/ 9621) 
i just well i did not understand as much to you probably <laugh> i just like clear this is to what i needed to do to become an art major and i go to my advise and they tell me what to take and it was the art advisors but i did not really think i had to do anything especially i do not know about the poor fully on review and all that stuff and that was probably my own fault for not asking questions but so it took me a while and then i just kind of went to come the state and went on the news and then came back and so he just got accepted into that college but yeah 

Recording: (7486/ 9621) 
stuff like that and i think they even might have found like one or two guns so and that to me was but my high school is two thousand people so i guess by sheer numbers one or three persons it would bring a gun 

Recording: (7487/ 9621) 
i do i am against religion in school i just do not think they should push that on people uh you know i mean i do not think they should make people pray if they do not want to be for class for an anything you know like that but as far as morals and the right thing to do in life and what is out there and you know most kids know what the wrong thing is but 

Recording: (7488/ 9621) 
i am on the computer at least six hours a day 

Recording: (7489/ 9621) 
that is surprising 

Recording: (7490/ 9621) 
does that makes sense 

Recording: (7491/ 9621) 
like just like like usedal showers and stuff and like um just how it is like one room you like kind of living or whatever you know it is more like you know like the army or something you know like real simple and everything is uniformed like uh 

Recording: (7492/ 9621) 
and she just came here and they live with me a year ago so she could have her baby here 

Recording: (7493/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7494/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7495/ 9621) 
yeah i think that is probably you know i am i am not that familiar with it now but i think that they are getting better in in seeing the cracks and things like that that people have fall through 

Recording: (7496/ 9621) 
yeah <laugh> 

Recording: (7497/ 9621) 
well i get the sense that if there are disciplined problems it is so hard to get anything done to solve them unless you know unless somebody brings a gun in ways around the school you know that the big thing now but just that you know it is just so hard to get anything done um and i think at that point the teachers get frustrated because they do not see the support across through the even news administration that they do have is they have to wait so something is pretty pretty regious before they before it is dealt with 

Recording: (7498/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7499/ 9621) 
i would be a lot happier 

Recording: (7500/ 9621) 
i actually joined the church in uh well i do not know six years ago about six years ago and they did a survey here at lsu and they were on them just asking people bill if they saw it that christ had visited america and there was a record of that account if do i think that would be important and i just like believe i would think so yeah <laugh> and but i did not i was kind of hesitant i mean it took me a while that i read the book one women and i really prayed about it and took me about about six months and and then i finally decided that i really liked it and it was what i had been wanting so that is how i just a 

Recording: (7501/ 9621) 
right because everything that has a coupon has tons of fat tons of sugar and is overpriced 

Recording: (7502/ 9621) 
yeah they yeah she moved in with him 

Recording: (7503/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7504/ 9621) 
it is all right 

Recording: (7505/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7506/ 9621) 
so indirectlyically it was a very bad reason that i came here but it worked out 

Recording: (7507/ 9621)

Recording: (7527/ 9621) 
okay <laugh> 

Recording: (7528/ 9621) 
oh yeah um yes and no they are kind of weird like that um once that of grandparents who are they can not hear whoever says anything there is it said on the other side that they are a little bit more racist uh but at the same time it i do not know they almost set up like a double standard for black people they are black people that they really like and i mean they are actually friends with some black people and they are black people that they do not like for whatever the reason may be and those are the people that they race towards i mean it is the same thing that goes with white people obviously they are white people that you can stand there are white people that are just obnox just in you do not want to deal with um i mean it is basically the same thing <laugh> right oh yeah yeah yeah exactly no huh um i really do not think we did for the most part i can not say see any real big problems or anything like that that occur just because of the sex you are or anything i think that probably would cause a bigger problem than the black president uh honestly um although i i do not really see too many sex problems i definitely do see guys still being more like the decision making type and as being like the finals saying things rather than women and i would see them having an authority figure that is being a woman is causing problems to them 

Recording: (7529/ 9621)

oh well you doing that for oh 

Recording: (7539/ 9621) 
um not really because i think you know you and i do not think a lot of them at that stage are going to go out of their way to go and buy them so i do not think it is like oh i have a condom i am going to have that i mean actually this is a very hot topic in england right now because they they have got the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in the world and i mean their stories everywhere about you know twelve year olds having babies and i mean there they have gone to distributing condums on playings which which i do think is a little bit too much i think maybe having them available in the office is one thing they are there you know they can go in and get some or something but i think actually like physically you know passing them out is a bad idea but demonstrating that kind of thing i think it is pretty important just you know because of the simple fact of the statistics that they are they are doing it so at least at the very least they might as well be you know they have about it 

Recording: (7540/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7541/ 9621) 
yeah she is almost in the family 

Recording: (7542/ 9621) 
because then you know what is something major happens that first and then what but i think at least for children especially because they have no means to to help them ohs and like the parents obviously even if they are working a lot of times can not get health care for their children so i think at least for children because how many actions happen to children like he will always breaking arms and stuff 

Recording: (7543/ 9621)

okay well a few years ago there was this big fuss that you know we have got to close to some schools so we did not you know in rome and droping it is you know just the way the population goes and fromin is dropping is dropping we can not afford to keep them all going so it is close and it is just big studying they target us on to close well there was a big uproar from the people this kids went to that school like there will be whenever you close to the board back down and change its money the next year they came out on the study saying they need more schools but there was not a money for it so there was a big fun about that and two years later they come out with another study that says what they need to refurbish or not some schools close a couple and then knock some down and rebuild them and so like every two years it is a different direction and it is like they are almost afraid to take a stand that somebody is not going to like well if you are going to shut a school down somebody is going to be really ticked off 

Recording: (7557/ 9621) 
yeah i run into that on i think part of it was the high school at that time and i have gone to catholic schools all my life or whatever and obviously i have run into a lot more of the wealth here type people who either they just do not have time or do not have the interest and just pay people to do it 

Recording: (7558/ 9621) 
it is like like sometimes i think about people you know they call and and especially when i talk to the sometimes people call in and i i talk to you know i get the same people or whatever who wants more i suppose it is like there is people have this you know the we had this weird name or something that i can remember i will they will call back and off i think about it means like uh i have this you know like we had this weird like five minute relationship or something like that like that every couple of weeks or something and it is like i think about what their life is like and what they are actually like in the you know it is like so weird it is like i do not know but yeah get everybody

Recording: (7619/ 9621) 
yeah i remember political correctness 

Recording: (7620/ 9621)

Recording: (7621/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7622/ 9621) 
um i used to be a turner pilot and a flight instructor and i used to go to work at like eight oclock in the morning and get home for my first meal with johnny carson and i did this six days a week and to get my my one day off i would get up at like at seven oclock and get my car and drive to the mall and park and sleep in my car 

Recording: (7623/ 9621) 
and there was one where they were going along and there is a little uh spanish you look and dog about so only about that i kind of fall on long after though i am glad that i finally see somebody i can be sorry for to forthall worse off than i am 

Recording: (7624/ 9621) 
oh really 

Recording: (7625/ 9621) 
i really think civil rights have gone too far because for every rule that says you cannot do this to the other person there is another rule over here that that that is okay that or the person does it to you i mean there my mother used to say for every law that was written there is another law written over here that will actually is gonna actually nolify that and i and actually as i growing older i found it in it is worse than today is world as i said as the silver rights moving and you have a right to this and you have a right to that it is terrible murderers get away with murder now by that plea bargain that plea bargain i think is the most thing that ever was passed i do not think there should be any ped bardon is not it these are horrible but there are people who get murdered you instead of electric chair electric chair i still believe in it because they have someone who is true and i i do not believe that they should have ten years of uh what do they call that legal process where they can putting appeals you that is it i do not think that you should had that either one appeal or two should be the limit it they are still found guilty sorry and if an innocent person has not been able to prove he is in is in that she is one of the it was freaking up at his mind and he knows how to get away with it and get somebody else to blyed but i do not think there is that many innocent people that ever went to the electric chair that they should actually have qualified that because what right does that person have to live tv just about two or three days ago and here is this guy down the south then and as he is walked out and left behind him under putting him to cruise it well i did turn exactly what send it you go to do it i just says run your i am drawing the last spot he kills her now he is going to go and five me a plea bargain and he will get off with it because maybe he was abused to the child in the head going through the way of thinking what happened to this woman because of it i am sorry let him pay the penalty and if more people paid the penalty there would be more have people thinking twice three or four times before they did the same thing and that would help i think to stop some of that 

Recording: (7626/ 9621) 
that is exactly what it <laugh> 

Recording: (7627/ 9621) 
well i do not know that that is a cause it they they as a group uh this was kind of the happenstead that it this occurred as a result of the very major world war uh so in in terms of them causing that it was it was a happen slant and and part of this mass communication they were talking about uh began with them and yes they are a a is your influence because you were talking about numbers and you are talking about uh a a greater intercommunication i would like to go back one step or we are talking about when i made mentioned the three doors down you do not even know who that individual is and i want to stick with that uh i think that is profound as an individual communication we are near zero in terms of global mass communication to everybody with inner personal communications that is the key my opinion personal versus other personal communications and and it zeroed over here and we are almost a hundred percent over here but when we are in this other personal or global or massive whatever term is the most appropriate uh um john doug who speaks here he has an the famous idea of who jane douglas is over here on the personal used to be that yeah you knew who this person rides over here that is jane dog that lives in that third house and she married henry jackson look at remember old henry warren real was a golly wheel there and the other side of town mass communications as it is today they have not the heinous idea where can not even came from or we are in reject or we are old ones whoever it was not lived over there i said so i think i bet i i think you need the distinctive with between between the personal international relationship so maybe i die grass too far there or who the next door neighbor is 

Recording: (7628/ 9621) 
well i see i am going to add the phone way back and show my age again as most people would say uh i i would threely like to see this to happen but i also know that it it will never happen within the next three or four generations but i i am of a guy who still believe that the lady has a place in her home and i do not believe that we need uh man in one i out working and making incomes as everyone in the united states today feels they must uh has only the point rather to rather lightly a while ago and they are talking about need versus uh luxuries i want i want i want well i might the judgement is that we are spending today probably eighty percent of uh the income on things that they want a month and only twenty percent on what they need and that is all they need to spend on that need so therefore the this pardon 

Recording: (7629/ 9621) 
yeah i am i am opposed to parental consent um but i do not have kids so that that opinion does not mean as much as you are might from someone who did 

Recording: (7630/ 9621) 
oh really i had not heard that you know it it uh some of the ones clinton is back down i think i am sorry to this one as what i just said is you know for the health insurance and reform of the all that health insurance uh right um you know he backed down but it was not going to happen so he could keep you know the fear going for months and months a years and still nothing was going to happen it was the wrong time or we tried to move on to something else uh and it is regretable it has in comeback like you said it is like well i made the one attention did not they anyway so that is not it giving somebody else to pick it up well clinton is in the main back it like can he bring it back 

Recording: (7631/ 9621)

Recording: (7713/ 9621) 
yeah now 

Recording: (7714/ 9621) 
keep them on the nineties and came around and said he do not want our our deficit is going the other way we are we are going way out of the back on this thing as because you have been spending more consumbers doing the same thing they have a learn that mom and dad remember mom and i do not even got little pieces of china they need things you know i am at the whole house completely for nationalized cars we do not talk about buying cars nowadays we talk about leasing cars and pretty assume we are not going to be buying houses we will be leasing houses from the finance companies we will not be owning the land the finance you do not want it you at least it and that is our quality of life and when we go to third world countries they say i do not know how they can stay living here and yet you know what they probably have better quality of understanding one than than we do because i feel like the more you get closer to one another the further they become apart 

Recording: (7715/ 9621)

Recording: (7719/ 9621) 
i have been going to say loud enough that you have the right to why we have never called the right you know i have never called it lately to make the phone call and if they can convince them and the for a policeman can i think really what they ought to start doing is taping everything they said and taping it so it is so clear that there is no way that they can deny it and then yet they they have got that thing in the lot they are illegal so they will right you can not tape them on them say anything it would be nice if i could not be signed a paper for you then get them to get them to sign when they go in there you fully understand now what we are going to do and boy if they say then they really make it so and ask them two or three times on pay that they understand this before they sign this even well then how can they say that they they they have got to come up with new rules and they have got to make the penalty stick 

Recording: (7720/ 9621) 
uh which we we encouraged that 

Recording: (7721/ 9621)

Recording: (7754/ 9621) 
um <laugh> i do i it is i mean it is a very personal thing and in fact that is what they saw most of my patients are head drama so so they can not come up with some pretty wild stories but those vision are usually pretty clear and 

Recording: (7755/ 9621) 
yeah

Recording: (7760/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7761/ 9621) 
oh real negative she is real negative about things and and tries to put me down for being positive or you know i always see a way out of something and she does it and she i think she gets in place she feels like she is old at fifty and i said oh my gosh you do not even have any bad habits that said you know you could live to be a hundred that is fifty more years you know i mean if you look at it that way she is really you know fifty is not old adults i mean that is just as much as you learn you know you can not trade that but yeah my my one sister that is uh exactly seven years older than me we are the closest and then the sister that is two years older than me she is the same way she does a lot of things that i am like why are you doing that you know they will do that so and she she pretty much stays low and depressed a lot because of everything she goes there will be 

Recording: (7762/ 9621) 
yeah she she had to talk and my sister and i attend it and i do not like the problem i think with universal health care would be everyone do not you think like everyone with a little scratch would go in you know as opposed to like the very and i think i could drive costs up so there has to be a way to balance it i am not sure how you would go about doing that because you do not want to put a little limit and say okay you can only go three times a year

but having having done it before you know and uh knowing where i went wrong you know uh that would not happen again uh i have been off that shift for a while but but again that was back in the uh actually it was in the nineties early nineties but you know i was been doing it when we were we were uh the recreation type of thing you know as they uh daily you know somebody come knocking on the door you oh yeah okay well we uh boy uh uh stephen but i would like to do something like that and uh i would not mind having uh uh some kind of place for uh you know you see a lot of uh different down out type people and everything and uh really nobody really trying to help them or something you know and uh uh i would like to think but maybe even this thing you know could be like a saints worry for them to come in and get some piece of money or something you know um-hum 

Recording: (7892/ 9621) 
yeah humum again i mean you know put two and two together you get some young teachers right out of college and then you put them with all these high school girls and these girls are looking like you can not even you can not control the attraction there but you can be aware of it and you can you can uh put the put slow backs on girls and not leave it up to them to choose the height of their skirts and you know and they have got stairs up and down and you know they get in their lockers and they bend over it you know and that that is just too much i mean i think that is the first thing that has to be done take away that you know they should not even be that should not even be a thought you know and it is just brighting enough for the the guys their own age but then you put these young teachers in there maybe they are single guys that were just had a yeah all the time in high in college and then they get around on these girls in like oh my gosh well you know you got to look at that you got to be more aware 

Recording: (7893/ 9621) 
sad stories uh let us see oh i am

Recording: (7897/ 9621) 
she does not so much mind anymore i mean since i have turned eighteen i mean ever since then it is been a problem or anything i mean she is sort of let me have my own opinion 

Recording: (7898/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7899/ 9621) 
right um personally i think it is a good idea i mean i i mean to me you know it seems only a logical that you would only have the amount of children that you can support you know in that but i come from a completely different you know background and everything else and education than a lot um you know than most of probably the people that this would um concern but i do think i i do not know i mean with the the birth control that is available and you know all the options that there are sometimes i find it hard to be sympathetic for you know these people who just have so many children that they can not feed they just can not take care of i mean it is not like it was way back when when there was nothing and you were just stuck this way i mean a woman can you know you know protect yourself if you know the the men is not willing to do it or whatever so and and and adoption and all the other things 

Recording: (7900/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7901/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (7902/ 9621)

<laugh> 

Recording: (7904/ 9621) 
control problems oh of course there is always the lake sound like yeah well that could be hot water they send out heating hot water to all the different buildings from the power plant but about now they drain it it is drained for the summer to give us an opportunity to work on leaks and stuff so they might have drained it and that is why i quit <laugh> yeah and run away <laugh> put plastic huh yeah oh i do not know it seems like it is a tough call because it is very unusual situation here to high state where they have a union and they have so many any different skills in the union you think of unions you think of pipe fitterers you think of you do not think of such a wide variety of people and that is very hard to negotiate for anybody you know when you are talking raises and lots of money like this what is what they were going for and the majority of the people in the the trade is not real big participating in the union you know we just write along and from what i have seen over the twenty years i have been here is it seemed that a lot of the union what they did was was keep the trouble maker employees around longer you know and so we have really ever had a lot of use for the union but recently we just figured out that you know if they decide to strike we have no choice too and you can not work because they will take all the money you make across in that line so you can out work anybody that came back to work will lose all the money that they made do not take them to court and then yeah but again yeah it is against the union contract so you have this 

Recording: (7905/ 9621) 
um um they like me but then they do not like me 

Recording: (7906/ 9621) 
it is a good place they even stop playing the gett of music they had this juke box and it was horrible they played the same three songs of like poorly offensive lyrics and no melody oncever

Recording: (7908/ 9621)

Recording: (7909/ 9621) 
i wish i would these guys going to military school and so forth you know they have had problems before somewhere along the way whether it is academics or social are you ready to take on this additional responsibility no but we do not promote it again you are right we guess uh it percent of them are still we have academic for the the university oh you are going to be a sport athlete over then you have got come here have got we have got different standard here and i am sure they do for a student athlete as opposed to what your standards were coming into college i am presume you were not an athlete <laugh>

Recording: (7921/ 9621) 
yeah i just doing their corporate offices and that would be fun so eventually i will have my own radio <laugh> if they interviewed me and knew that they would quick get back no but that that is the most exciting thing right now is that i mean that looks real promising but and if i do that then i am going to have to to do something voluntary or some uh voluntary work or uh choices i i looked at that too that is choices for domestic violence that is an organization that i think would be real interesting and help me feel like you know helping people um they give uh new for abused uh wives and mothers and uh help them get on their feet you know give them the access to the different organizations that are out there basically tide them until they can get on their own because if they are abused the husbands are like you know a nightmare out there so things like that

Recording: (8089/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8090/ 9621)

so i mean it is that is what i am saying that i i think it is even the american disability act talks about certain things about employers uh and in with my lawsuit you know with the uh the shell and you know with all the public trials of high profile trials i think it is the okay sure every one to know that the legal system socks and does not work uh is not fair it is a rich man is person or a rich person is system bought and paid for they are elected uh there is a lot of crap there and i learned all this not from just my experience but from people that i i know their attorneys that there are judges down there that take bribs and that is that is not right so you can not when you are dealing with that system justice comes at a price and you get as much justice as you can afford and during my lawsuit that was very evident you know laws are made to protect people that are wealthy and they commit crimes and it is not right it is not fair but that is the way it is so uh i did not want to go on the wall <laugh> <laugh> did not want to go in the paralie going looking into that and the lady kept hounding me and telling me you know uh maybe you could get in it to make a difference i am like i want to make a difference if it kills me you know because i know myself and i do not put up with crap you know i see a lawyer i bring them out you know and uh uh i was just brought up to be an honest person and uh unfortunately there is a lot of people out there that you know they saw out their ideas and their principal for forty thousand dollars a year and then they use their family or their situation financially an excuse to sell those uh deals out um not that kind of person than i want to ever be um so if that means that i stay monetarily poor for the rest of my life then so be it you know i got a conscience and uh and people that are honest and have a conscious of dangers out there by that yeah that is basically where i have been you know um i have lived here my whole life like i said i went to college and played baseball uh due to injuries you know knees and shoulder i just i was very i was procalber you know uh i played baseball with uh with paul oneil and keint merker which are a couple of guys that you know did get sign professional center playing right now uh so at least things they have played against them and uh at least i have camped over i guess so he he had a home run off and so it was a while ago but was when he was young and very good and i was i was three four years older and still took him deep to centerfield so i will never forget that but uh iron it <laugh> so well uh well it uh uh you know i i do not refer to it as an accident anymore you know they are uh my whole life had changed uh in every f isically emotionally mentally and sparsly um before i am at home you know physically emotionally and mentally and spargely um used to be catholic i do not follow that away any more and um you know i follow them more uh uh natural way of my own i do not know and uh new age i do not wanna say exactly what you know just that the people this land long time ago before anybody came over here would bibles and crepe uh ram and jesus down people is third the people that is laying down to way of worth you have been god in this way i wanna put so away if all um so a lot of people say that the native american or say that indian or whatever you know i do not care what they want to put on it but uh that is that is a natural way of following god is the way i put it you know uh <laugh> worth it that uh respecting the spirit to move through all things all living and uh so i went through all that and all those changes and i are still you know coping with them and trying to find ways to cope with them to um 

Recording: (8100/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8101/ 9621) 
he said to me that can not be wrong because the computer said that was award i said that is a word come with me i will show you what a best of u was 

Recording: (8102/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8103/ 9621) 
i know i know well it is good to have that i think it would be good to have that lee way <laugh> but i am not sure i would trust myself because there there were definitely times when i was teaching when i would have more or i am in a finity towards certain students and less towards others and i wanted to be fair in terms of uh not cutting down the ones that i did not like that much <laugh> yeah yeah 

Recording: (8104/ 9621) 
you do 

Recording: (8105/ 9621) 
and i i really feel like if you are going to run for president of the united states you ought to be smart 

Recording: (8106/ 9621) 
there is yeah 

Recording: (8107/ 9621) 
no that is one thing that i you know i found was really lacking here um for my side uh 

Recording: (8108/ 9621) 
um-hum sure 

Recording: (8109/ 9621) 
he is really he is yeah he does not think through the application that the things are of my own is for somebody 

Recording: (8110/ 9621) 
i mean obviously being a being a little boy i remember i mean just seeing the even things like football or whatever i mean it is it sees something anything to do with 

Recording: (8111/ 9621) 
hope the curb <laugh> 

Recording: (8112/ 9621) 
yeah it it says 

Recording: (8113/ 9621) 
i was working out there 

Recording: (8114/ 9621) 
i wish they could 

Recording: (8115/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8116/ 9621) 
oh yeah it is kind of like making your mouth water when you see food 

Recording: (8117/ 9621) 
on the other thing is to close i just feel we have to keep we have to grow those people have to travel so far to shop and you know and i do not think that is really fair to them 

Recording: (8118/ 9621) 
to me that was very strange 

Recording: (8119/ 9621) 
oh she is cute she really is really cute i mean i mean she is got big eyes and big fluffy cheese 

Recording: (8120/ 9621) 
it is always gonna be somebody can complain about something well that is another thing where you have to take the individuality into account because not everybody likes to cook you know everybody most people know how to open a can of soup or something and boil water make some toes but you know that is about all that they want to do as far as it comes to cooking even if they do have to cook for their family not everybody not every female likes to cook you know they just do it because you know they are supposed to or whatever and i know some families where the men the the husband does all of the grocery shopping and all the cooking and the wife does you know whatever she does i mean it is individuality again so 

Recording: (8121/ 9621) 
okay so people get like fly in do do they do they little waiting things why out 

Recording: (8122/ 9621) 
yeah it is weird they i do not know this makes sense a little bit different so 

Recording: (8123/ 9621) 
that does not so much bother me it is just having it forced on me like i say just sort of gives me a different opinion of it 

Recording: (8124/ 9621) 
yeah you even got these oh stunk guns they are the ones that scare me 

Recording: (8125/ 9621) 
yeah james and james and i went together 

Recording: (8126/ 9621) 
um-hum um-hum 

Recording: (8127/ 9621) 
see that they are again the business out box the consumer basically you need to do less consuming in buying material goods and sharing your time with one other try it understand your neighbor more and spend time getting quality time for understanding the intangibles of life the people is depreciate and they will depreciate and we will be nothing and your investment is gone 

Recording: (8128/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8129/ 9621) 
well that used to be where you know all the teenage teenagers went 

Recording: (8130/ 9621) 
yeah exactly 

Recording: (8131/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8132/ 9621) 
um i mean i feel i lean toward no i do not have a problem actually i saw the movie on the news the other night about they were offering um crack mothers like money for a sterilization and there was a big debate about that um but again like the argument there on the human rights side was that if they are you know on cocaine or whatever they can not make the sound decision to be sterilized by at the same time like can they make the sound decision to have children 

Recording: (8133/ 9621) 
because see well i have five babies you know i really have to work when you talk about that the older you get i have to work really really hard to stay in halfway decent shape 

Recording: (8134/ 9621) 
i love it <laugh> 

Recording: (8135/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8136/ 9621) 
no well i mean the money you know money is great you know fine it is the biggest raise they have ever given anybody here at the university and actually the deal that they offered the sunday before they went on on strike was a better deal than what they have really settled for now as far as because the signing bonus was more and the big the fact that these people did not want to be separated from the hospital they do not think it is fair you know that you start down at the hospital as a janitor or whatever ever and you make this amount and if you came to main campus you would make seventy five cents more an hour automatic and then they did the raise and they wanted eighty cents at the hospital and a dog all their own main campus and stuff so that is kind of a sticky situation because they have always kept the university in the hospital separate budget they are init only a separate budget and you know the hospital i can see where they are coming from everybody in the hospital business is struggling right now with the insurance problems and this and that and they are thirty five million in the hole because they bought us used and all this but you know it is not the union is fault that they ran out their contract you know and you know so and what we find in our area mainly is that people uh insurance wage is so low that it is hard to find anybody they that has any skills to come in and do the jobs that you know and they want this place to be the top ten in the nation or whatever as far as but they are not willing to pay a lot of these people and you know they think contracting is the way but you are always gonna have to have people here to to because contractors just do not drop what they are doing and show up today and a lot of sometimes we have a job finish before they have written up the work order 

Recording: (8137/ 9621) 
well when you have formulas to make bums and you know 

Recording: (8138/ 9621) 
it did not it is at the same building actually it is it is set it is used for different things 

Recording: (8139/ 9621) 
yeah i was over in nineteen i was eighteen when i went in but 

Recording: (8140/ 9621) 
exactly but i do there there is the other side um that uh with with native americans too it is you know you know our children are being taken away from it well not exactly your giving up your children and and then something has to be done but but there is also there is also that that i i mean i think it is probably the legitimate fear that children uh children of that group are going to you know going to be a lot ofized out of out of their heritage but i do not know i you know their kids without parents <laugh> 

Recording: (8141/ 9621) 
i mean they are agave in congress they are a gavees in the military you know just as long as people do not know they they do not feel threatened but then and and i have uh i i do not understand that minds that i really do not i do not know why uh a man feels threatened by having a game near them uh i have a couple of game friends and in one of my friends always says um you know does every man like every woman he sees is he attracted every woman and you know wanna go to bed with every woman you know what makes a man think that just because i am gay a i might be interested in him you know that is the height of oregon um years but but men feel threatened by that just as i guess women feel threatened by lesbians i do not know but it is not the minds that i have so it is hard for me to understand

Recording: (8175/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (8176/ 9621) 
yeah you still have to be careful in yeah 

Recording: (8177/ 9621) 
um-hum i am sure somewhere i am sure somehow in line they would work things out to try to help it over those bums it would not be long term and they would know that it would not be long term but that is that intense she is giving up her time and not to make the high bucks but she what she is bringing about is developing a character and a person to bring about the spirit out probably in a person that is going to carry them all through life she is also um tighting more than tighting probably which uh i always uh you know people have said the author that said ten percent tiding new inflation he knew grade about economics ten percent is ten percent and then uh on top of that you know we talk about economics uh look further here uh the japanese so forth they save so much more and the on germans so forth and uh boy i am uh taking a picture of the old bible are not they we do not <laugh>

Recording: (8179/ 9621) 
i am getting ready to get through layoffs again where i work at 

Recording: (8180/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (8181/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (8182/ 9621) 
because that is more boring 

Recording: (8183/ 9621) 
um to move forward in my life now what happened with the chill was you know there was uh i had a friend that work for them so they did not know that and um uh he told me that there was glass in the back room that they were supposed to and it is talled supposed to have been stalled that was five feet higher three to five feet higher and uh if it was up i would not go ahead i mean there is no two ways about it but if i did not get it hit i would not be where i am now spiritfully so i do not refuse bogas in accident and most of the spiritual leaders and people i talk to uh i went through the catholic church because that was where i was raised and when i was raised and now those people provivement with any adequate things in terms of counseling i know they tried i know they did the best they could but um there is a lot of things that the catholic church will not like to admit that they are wrong and they are wrong um uh they will sit there and ask me to tone from on my sons yet they will not return for the sons of all the threes that are molesting children still to this day and they protect them and it is not right and i am very very say uh outspoken them out that so rather than bang my head on the wall to people who would not listen i just i do not leave the church i do not go there anymore i have gone there was for my nephew ised bapism and my grandparents is you know and that is the only time they will find me in there you know i went to a wedding too you but it is difficult sitting in there because of the way i found now and uh and actually seeing things for what they are and it is first austrating not being able to explain that to people but that is okay uh the lawsuit uh we had a private investigator that went in there and found all the information nation that showed that they had all that higher taller glass back there over a year so they so they are trying to use the excuse their excuse was that they could not find the hardware doing all that and uh giving all the hardware stores that we have here and the ability of overnight afraid things uh if it was any kind of uh special hardware that needed to be ordered from out of state or out of the country there is no excuse you know so basically you know they came down to after it came to a legal battle which was so i was not going to back down they were uh i was poor monet they knew that so they were using the legal system to wear me down um the first uh at the date of filing i mean first of all it took had a statute of limitations was two years uh i had an attorney in the law firm or a beginning but they were dragging their feet i felt they were dragging their feet because they were in bed with the chill you know and that they were getting paid under the table to drag their feet even though i knew the guy so i just said oh look i am dissatisfied i am gonna go fight another attorney so it will give me my file see and i went shopping around for a new attorney and it took me about seven before um pardon me seven attorneys before i found one that was adequate in terms of knowledge of head injury and brain injury because his father was a nurse surgeon and uh he had experience an expertise in uh bringing up the uh the differences uh in the realities of of a brain injury uh and the effects the wife long effects you know so after the two years the years we got in uh just under the two years so i mean oh that would be what it happened in ninety three so just under december ninety five uh the day the last day of uh the statute in the run and out we found so we got it found once it was found the judge uh scheduled hearing and for whatever stupid reason um the soonest they could hear the case was one year from the day that we follow so you can see when you get in the bed with you know and involved in the legal system in terms of finding a multimillion dollar lawsuit or whatever you know in you kind of off suit uh the big boys get all the breaks so uh in my opinion the judge did not want to hear the case before then or made b is dock was full but i am saying you know there is no priorization in the legal system there are some things that uh should be addressed see um i should not have to wait that long but so then came down to a one week prior to the uh hearing and they got a letter from my attorney and he said that uh an also phone call from the office saying that uh um and which meant that uh the judge they have been paying them an additional year of discovery um whatever the law says you know the bushes me up you know but that is opposed to supposed to supposed trial for another year which would be a pain in the you know but that is exactly what they were plan you know wearing me down like i said knowing that i do not have the money to throw in there and say hey you know um but they know for a while that we had all the evidence that we had too so uh that just push upon it for another year finally we got into uh coming in and then they uh sent a letter saying they wanted to meet uh for a for a for a for a for a for a for a for a for a for a for a for a for a for a for a for a for a for a for auh for a for auh for auh for a meat uh for a for meotation to see if they we could hammer out some kind of settlement a couple months before trial uh i was on a where it was a common trial is but you know it was very iffy situation uh juries here uh in climates have been ultra conservative uh they feel that people for some reason or another that people that have been legitimately injured in their lives have been affected that they do not deserve money for whatever is not uh and it i do not think it is fair that they can sit back and be that conservative if it has not happened to them um i do not think that is fair uh because it does affect your entire lot of time otherwise i would be full time employed i would be getting full employed and making money and them not and that is that is not because of anything uh it is by choice is on my part but it is it is uh you know there is a lot that there is a lot there the portray that i have had to struggle with there is a lot there that uh you know i felt i have been portrayed by everybody that taught me i feelfed by the government by the legal system by the politicians by all the people who been put in charge to protect people to protect the ideas to protect principals throw it out to wonder for money and then when it comes down to me beenlegly hurt uh they got down to just a dollars and cents bartering for what my life was worth and it is thes starting out of twenty five thousand dollars and i feel home worth more than that um i feel you can not put a value on any of the life um you know they were just subtle things that you know my sense of taste and some of them was gone for about a year and a half uh uh just all the drama that goes involved with it not just not just the physical drama i mean that was enough to kill anybody but because of me because of my guys because of my strength uh i was not killed you know um so the physical burden you know the of dealing with a lot of the physical paint uh it is gotten significantly less but uh the emotional paint was worse in is worse um having to have a you know a lack of money now means lack of socializing means lack of you know do not have any uh a lot of relationships do not have a girl friend do not have my wife do not nothing like that i have got a dog a golden retriever

you know so they offer do something to med school here 

Recording: (8391/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8392/ 9621) 
it is hard to 

Recording: (8393/ 9621) 
ah 

Recording: (8394/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (8395/ 9621) 
they have heard some of them talk about it 

Recording: (8396/ 9621) 
no i do not know maybe it is a little bit more dangerous uh but i think that comes with the with the bigger city when you get more people there is obviously going to be some more problems um but now i mean that is really that is really all that i notice it is obviously a lot more build up it is gotten a lot more commercial things like city center and 

Recording: (8397/ 9621) 
that makes sense and a lot of the new ball parks are made smaller so they can hit home runs because that just shocks fast people go nuts people would rather see a tight game it was like seven to like shake other than much like uh a two to one ball game 

Recording: (8398/ 9621) 
real positive about it but basically i i lived here for for my whole life and i grew up on campus and 

Recording: (8399/ 9621) 
i thought it was sporty three 

Recording: (8400/ 9621)

Recording: (8404/ 9621) 
so it does not ever fall it is in the audience and <laugh> 

Recording: (8405/ 9621) 
sends to what thethous you should be like <laugh> so we had a tour uh the choir took a tour or choir director uh arrangeed it to about six or five or six churches in the columbus area to sing in them and not for an audience but just to sing and to see which ones we like the acoustics of and uh that was interesting we sang in uh we sang in central presbyterian church downtown which is where this my one of my orchestras play the lot and uh we sang in other different kinds of churches and said what we liked about them what we did <laugh> maybe it had some feedback i think the new building is acoustically very good it is certainly much better than old more ship center because i do not know if you have seen a picture or anything of the church but the old warship center was designed by a modern architect to be a modern uh quote unquote type building in nineteen sixty two and it is yeah it is it is flat there is a flat roof with a clear story in the middle that has nothing in it just it is just empty space over the over the woodstock center so when you would sing in that is a choir right out along the front if you were under the high place your voice would go all the way to the back but if you were under this flat feeling that is only about seven or it is only about nine or ten feet high it was dead it was not from the <laugh> and uh it was terrible <laugh> but you know we made do it for many years and then uh and then we had the chance to get this input into this new building and it is it is a it is really beautiful it is a circular almost circular big uh space with a high point in the middle the roof and uh it is it is nice <laugh> well you could still go it they will not have they will not have a lot of uh 

Recording: (8406/ 9621) 
so yeah those places were probably about thirty years old i you know fire hazard insulation just you know firehousing everywhere 

Recording: (8407/ 9621) 
right and i think that you know i think that it is just because you know you do so because i know i had done studies and i took some of those classes and you just think about it that way and i think a lot of these people just you know they say the nurse said something to take everything for a fact and i thought that was kind of strange but i mean i think there is a lot of things that are probably positive enough about it that i would not want to do it for for a lot bile as long as i could 

Recording: (8408/ 9621) 
well well yeah well librarianians traditionally have problems with it it is like a former <laugh> you know big brother things libraryans have always had problems with that um i i do not know it is hard to balance it if somebody is out there actually doing criminal work criminal activity causing damage you want to know about it but how do you do they have some particular rights of everybody else that i do not know how to balance it 

Recording: (8409/ 9621) 
um as far as my brother goes i cant say i really see my brother too often um he does live in town uh but usually he is either at work because he works full time than he has he is a part time student at columbus state um so i do not really see him during the day and then at and i usually goes out and that is his thing i go out and do my thing so i mean as far as what is going on with him i really do not know but i know i mean there is nothing real serious going on with him or anything i because yeah

Recording: (8415/ 9621) 
and it my husband sometimes i mean we have taken jury out to the military a few times to go to the grape side of his mother and he says you know very often boy she would really have liked to have been here and done things with him

Recording: (8466/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8467/ 9621)

Recording: (8470/ 9621) 
right um-hum 

Recording: (8471/ 9621) 
um-hum it is kind of frustrating but i do not i it is a good it is probably good for me because i am so it is hard for me to just sit back and let other people believe whatever they want to believe you know i just want to convince them but i can not do that so it is a good exercise for me i look at it that way and just letting them go ahead and 

Recording: (8472/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (8473/ 9621) 
bly clothes you be correctly i just noticed that it continued to decline all through high school and i was like you should get out before you actually fail the class <laugh> and um it was it was just unpleasure i think i was stupid i think that is one of the most amount to not that i was not able to pick up the data i was just um unwise and and whether or not it was worthwhile and i believe it it is uh probably worthwhile now and yet now i am not taking classes so 

Recording: (8474/ 9621) 
to deal with 

Recording: (8475/ 9621) 
i mean the way i grew up is probably like back in the day like the catholics against uh columbus public you know like the red cheese against the poories that is how i kind of see but when i went to northland people are being north north like a red school but the way i see it no not really i mean we do live in a big you know house area you know the houses are like huge but um um i mean columbus public they they got some work done too like the other night i was watching tv and uh and elementaries overdozed the kid on like some uh i think it was a drug to calm him down so he is not so hyper in the like overdosedian light twice in a day and then when he goes home as a mom even overdue his name because he they are overdue his name 

Recording: (8476/ 9621) 
and we month they are what they watch television wise we do a lot of library things get them to the library a couple of days a week trying to keep them interested in the books an

Recording: (8480/ 9621) 
but eventually in a way i just i i just because i would get stressed out and start crying and crazy you know 

Recording: (8481/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8482/ 9621) 
um and it was nice uh just seeing that and you could tell they were still in love and everything and you know and one of them had four children one had like six you know i mean it was amazing because i about why that they are not still married getting right out of high school i just was not interested in that when i was in high school at all you know i was ready to go out into the world in these girls and get married to them and they just have no clue about life 

Recording: (8483/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (8484/ 9621) 
i deliver the columbus this batch in the morning too so 

Recording: (8485/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8486/ 9621) 
he sure was 

Recording: (8487/ 9621) 
very often i mean maybe like there is like one or two that come during the year 

Recording: (8488/ 9621) 
oh yeah yes 

Recording: (8489/ 9621) 
we were talking about this at work one day and they said you know i am surprised you think that way because i can it be a little left to set it on most of these sometimes it is far left but and i said now this is not i she said it seems like that would be a conservative view my opinion the conservative view is that they do not want to go back to cuba back to the communists that people i have talked to even extreme conservative and liberals they all pretty much feel the same way that ones are i have heard i have heard anybody 

Recording: (8490/ 9621) 
and my young star when i was crabbing back that they said i talked to them and they said well we are coming to ohio in a couple of weeks and i said oh okay you did not come and see us um well now we were not we were not planning that and i she said well why well we are not driving uh doggy is running at the car well all that meant with my sister was running the car but he was driving the car and i said well then how are you going to get to these other places and normally i would not do that i would just let it go well uh uh doggy is running that car and they said well are are not you driving it well well yeah but nice sure fine i do not want to even think about so it is kind of like 

Recording: (8491/ 9621) 
well i believe that is the way it was originally said uh beautiful so 

Recording: (8492/ 9621) 
uh well i am not to mayor or anything so i am not going to be getting from this <laugh> 

Recording: (8493/ 9621) 
like the most far 

Recording: (8494/ 9621) 
yeah <laugh> 

Recording: (8495/ 9621) 
he is like this robot 

Recording: (8496/ 9621) 
yeah <laugh> i am at the end of it all 

Recording: (8497/ 9621) 
but then uh it is like that some evil person back there in the screening room put some of this junk in there right in the middle and then you go you can not stop and not watch that and if i was in church i would i would catch some of it out it is not that important 

Recording: (8498/ 9621) 
oh probably my family my kids are here have a grandchild now so yeah i would like to stay close to all them 

Recording: (8499/ 9621) 
why do not you do it for a year i know do it for a year just go down for the day and then come back to up around from the night and live i would like to do that um 

Recording: (8500/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8501/ 9621) 
very slow very methodical we take them to dog my husband is taken them many times for when they had to have cadillac operations you know so he is involved with the girls too 

Recording: (8502/ 9621) 
yeah i do not know that is so controversial i mean i mean to the point i mean they shell them out of put kind of money in us and public schools and it is like oh are you voting sex than it as you should do i 

Recording: (8503/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8504/ 9621) 
well like i do not flash them in here so like if you look at like different ethical areas and stuff like you like there is a high ourinkind of this is what i found there is a high work of things that are uh like the alien animal rights for instance like i can not if you calling into my house and rob me and then run outside i not going to i do not like to kill you for stealing my property like there is a high market there uh for stealing another life that is why people say oh you you can do it so but i really feel like there is nothing like if i if it is in the amy animal the definition is it is not able to be taken not even by yourself that is why you can not commit suicide and since it is the highest thing because without it you can not even do the other kids so it naturally has to be higher ordered than the others because without that you can not do the you can not be ethical in any other way so that has to be the highest thing and if it is to be the highest thing and if it is to be i did not get it to you i can not take it back you never forefitted that you never gave me that right so that is why i feel like i could never want that in it to kill another person 

Recording: (8505/ 9621) 
but it kind of helps actually because uh you have other people in there who are not owners and they do not know how to lick their partying they do not have to study or anything so 

Recording: (8506/ 9621) 
oh see 

Recording: (8507/ 9621)

Recording: (8514/ 9621) 
short uh s a for for a test and uh but the way that i would grade those would be pretty scientific i think you know it would come up with a rubber and i would they you you need to have you need to mention certain things and i will give certain points for you mentioned that sort of thing <laugh> yeah i have i have never been a i have never been a teacher where who is had to assign their grade creative writing and im not sure i would know how to do that yeah

Recording: (8539/ 9621) 
um-hum do you know um a group called uh midnight oil yeah <laugh> they are pretty good i like them yeah 

Recording: (8540/ 9621) 
um sector and i think that is a good sign but i think there is a huge there is millions of children that do not have any health care and that is not right there is like there is a a lot of like between the low in the opera there is a huge disparity but at least it is a step in the right direction we have a a nice south middle middle income middle income middle income middle income base i think because a lot of countries only have the like i visit of mexico and seems like they only had the distinctive between the opera and lower i mean their middle class is very small and that i but that i mean coming along too and i mean it it will be it developing itself which is which is nice i took a tour of a a plant down there because my my old my old man had business down there so i might time just to see it and like it seems like it was coming along and they treat their workers better granted those workers make the equivalent of like seven bucks a day but they get they get bussed into work because none of them have cars and then on top of that they all get a meal because they they like a high meal like we have a cafeteria there because i was talking to the the one of the managers and he said if we do not do that then they will not be thinking about our quality and they will be thinking about getting food and they will it hurts our quality so for them it was worth it and i 

Recording: (8541/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8542/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8543/ 9621) 
um well like i said before i think i do not know i think screening would be very difficult i mean especially because at that age you are gonna have a lot of people who or you know people say things to say things and to get a reaction and to tell their friends but they said i mean you know they can play off whatever and unless they were yeah 

Recording: (8544/ 9621) 
um-hum i do not know that they would use the information <laugh> i i do not know

i mean no crash or anything but was rather scared <laugh> kind of shaken up by it but um no they are very very serious about does not need of drivers 

Recording: (8546/ 9621) 
well most people think it is something they rely on like well the money getting from the lottery to the people or lottery to the schools on that issue then yeah i i agree with the gambling thing you know just as long as it is like social drinking <laugh> and in a sense because if you have people just go out like today i bought a one dollar a lot of the ticket one two bucks off of it so i kept my one a got a one dollar i do not know and got a one dollar i did not own yeah there is yeah there is <laugh> and then then there is these um little bit more expensive cards you buy the lotary cards one of them is called battle ship that i have won lot of money off of 

Recording: (8547/ 9621) 
sitting air about that 

Recording: (8548/ 9621)

Recording: (8556/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8557/ 9621) 
um actually it is more it is almost like turned into like self business um like i said it started out with my dad and then people would ask me what i do not i tell them they back oh all that is some things around the house that need to be done then so i go there then they tell people and 

Recording: (8558/ 9621) 
teacher a couple teachers so i take a bunch of every couple years i go to different country 

Recording: (8559/ 9621)

Recording: (8560/ 9621) 
well yeah 

Recording: (8561/ 9621) 
i know 

Recording: (8562/ 9621)

Recording: (8569/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8570/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8571/ 9621) 
yeah she just likes the right stories and she is real creative that way 

Recording: (8572/ 9621) 
yeah it would be good though because they could take care of the books and everything and do all that kind of thing so 

Recording: (8573/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8574/ 9621) 
no painting was needed uh well then then as a result they they went through and decided since i broke the lease to uh you know get some more money out of me and go ahead and repaint it anyway and they uh stretched out the first rating and changed it to a lower rating um and even though that evidence which is in front of a magic rate 

Recording: (8575/ 9621) 
oh that is unfortunate she she 

Recording: (8576/ 9621) 
oh they do in ninth grade and by tenth grade in the last they are a little more focused on the fact that they better get their act together because they are gonna have to go to college and this is like the only life they are going to get you know they kind of get that realization they start getting serious kids at middle school think everything is just a big joke you know oh i am going to play in a rock band uh you know they all think they are going to be rock stars and drummer and and you know they could care less about anything it has not hit them yet this is my real life does of course my one real life better not throw it away they waste time you know they lose uh 

Recording: (8577/ 9621) 
yeah and and everybody is going to says she was the people that did feel comfortable with so you know and fortunately as that guy this guy in particular rooms is centered for a football brew out as a knee for uh oh you you know uh by which of i went to school with larry hunter who is the uh basketball coach for uh ou now and uh any of the same thing happened to him that he has a scholarship row year and both of his knee are shot and everything but uh and he was a good ball par of one of the best ones in our we are seeing uh drive on like a large bird you know back in that day and everything and uh but one heck of a that is great you know never let it get to it 

Recording: (8578/ 9621) 
yeah and it was like i do not know that that states go to a taurus for killing people i think they killed someone last night 

Recording: (8579/ 9621) 
i think um the people who are already graduated they like to the doctors and the the dentist and all the people who went here have a really good reputation like among adults it is just that the kids want to go it it is just thought of it to some what party school 

Recording: (8580/ 9621) 
but i do believe if you know when you are in love and you love somebody you will not you will not too on that 

Recording: (8581/ 9621) 
oh um-hum 

Recording: (8582/ 9621) 
that i wanted them to fall charges on him and they said well no uh he is not met the criteria ah i said well he gets here just in time to not be counted uh party or not tardsy but

um probably would have been about six years ago i mean in six or seventh grade 

Recording: (8596/ 9621)

Recording: (8597/ 9621) 
and it is it is one color tax that no pictures so you always ask you what things look like and then you do not can not tell them and too it is like the computers are all screwed up like you type in you know like type in computers and they will say we do not have them but we obviously do in life and you will look at it in a different way and you will be able to find them like it is uh it is really weird i do not understand 

Recording: (8598/ 9621) 
are you sure i 

Recording: (8599/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (8600/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8601/ 9621) 
i think there is a heck of a lot more to it than what we will probably ever know uh you know they they really have not checked into the background of the parents you know as to what their beliefs were in there any uh you know i think that is a shame because you know you mentioned it before about something accidently happening and anymore some kids shoots another kid you know oh and then the parents are are responsible for it and everything you know these two kids deliberately one in two kill and they wanted to kill more than what they killed uh then it kills themselves so we have never know from their standpoint why they did it but i think there is got to be something that we could find out from you know uh from their parents as to how they live you know they could have been in anything you know they could have been down there they could have been making him make an even do it you know 

Recording: (8602/ 9621)

Recording: (8635/ 9621) 
you know he says it eagles mc square and i say it is eagles mcc ubed because the world is three dimension it is not too dimension uh two the dimension limits and everything but you look at history of relatively relatively all of our mathematicalinical they have been based on that 

Recording: (8636/ 9621)

i know that is okay i i just do not want to touch it 

Recording: (8638/ 9621) 
it was just like that i am telling you it was and we would see you know they would put things on the on the screen for us to watch i i mean i learned a lot of stuff it was very a very good experience all in a row very good 

Recording: (8639/ 9621)

that would be good 

Recording: (8643/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (8644/ 9621) 
oh i do not really think so i think of myself as kind of an impatient person but i guess i do not i guess i do not i do not getting shocked by some of the things they do as some people do and i do not yell and scream at them and i mean realize they did not ask to have a learning disability i mean and then they can not they are not some teachers think they are just being consesterate enough they would and what i tried to tell those teachers is they can not change their learning disability any more you can change your brownized you know they were born with it it is genetic someone else in their family has it they can learn they just do not learn the same way everybody else does you have to break it down and in the pieces or teaching a different way it is like teaching them math problem in two different ways you get the same answer but one way works better for you and well that is how they are you know maybe they do not learn while by listening maybe they do not learn by well by looking at a chart or something maybe they only learn well when they are up moving around doing something you know you just have to understand that their avenues of learning are like different than yours and totally some of them might be totally screwed up like they might hear half of what you say or they might jump up what you say you say turn the page three ninety three or and they turn to three thirty in their book you know when they think they did what you said it is just like something is mixed up between the actual eye and the ear and then where it gets interpreted into the brain it gets all scramled somehow and i always tell teachers if you could just walk uh for one day in their shoes you would probably have a lot of apathy bordom 

Recording: (8645/ 9621)

right willing to do that again 

Recording: (8732/ 9621) 
right right <laugh> 

Recording: (8733/ 9621) 
yeah it is like the uh the woman that used to live in the apartment where we live before us see she had a husband she is married to for quite some time he got on oh his number one d y list with eighteen d y is oh man can you imagine how much money he is put into that i mean you think your first do i offense will be about thousand dollars fine and we can in jail bush something but eighteen of them and you are racking up all that money and all those legal bills and all that time i think he is in jail now 

Recording: (8734/ 9621) 
civil rights um well i i take the extreme position that civil rights are an allusion um yeah they are on paper which is a good thing because it was a terrible thing when uh there were laws that restricted someone because of their ethnic background or because of their gender but i think in many ways it has had little effect on creating an equal unfair society uh i mean maybe somebody leftist positions will come out right now uh people have the freedom but i believe that based upon where we are in the social strategy you were born in the united states uh you have a a limited ability to move upward and that the these class i mean i i do not want to say class lines because that has so many like historical connotations because it not the exact same as they class was in the march they but class lines still today very much um follow race lines and what good is like knowing that you have the freedom to vote when you know painfully well that you are not going and to be able to get a job that is gonna buy a house for your family and let them live in relative comfort i mean in in real terms in things i think are valuable to the individual oh 

Recording: (8735/ 9621) 
yeah for everybody so it is kind of a really big deal and my parents are the oldest from from their families too so it is a first great grandchild and and with uh my husband he and it is he he do all that so for everybody 

Recording: (8736/ 9621) 
i do not know where i am going to find to honestly i am thinking it was good to be doing a career for they 

Recording: (8737/ 9621) 
so yeah 

Recording: (8738/ 9621) 
or limited very limited 

Recording: (8739/ 9621) 
it is an island put it planet together i liked it there i kind of like i i figure they will probably hook up but i do not like how the show this show and this happened with deep space ninety two and even with next generation for a little bit how the shows become soap opera like um i mean the romantic aspect of the stories do not really appe to me very much um we are interested in the social things and you know good old special effects um but uh i i think i like that how it is kept with a sort of a tension and it is not like you know they are not completely thrown together like uh ballon and tom which i do not like that at all 

Recording: (8740/ 9621) 
biddle is not that much dirt <laugh> so uh whenever they we heard any firing like that was coming to our door does by we for that whole 

Recording: (8741/ 9621)

Recording: (8744/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8745/ 9621) 
i did not know that 

Recording: (8746/ 9621) 
totally left that part out no one is something to me in about no throwing up or anything that that really made any sense 

Recording: (8747/ 9621) 
i just think it is a different time now i do not think uh i think everybody is living more for a day to talk about the future you know hoping it the future is there i think there is uh uh quote unquote uh in time aspect of life you know 

Recording: (8748/ 9621) 
you know now 

Recording: (8749/ 9621) 
okay good 

Recording: (8750/ 9621) 
i am trying to create organic in my head and 

Recording: (8751/ 9621) 
well did you spend much to utah doing it besides stocking 

Recording: (8752/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8753/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8754/ 9621) 
but you understand what i am saying it is you are going to have to make make it so the guns that you got are harder to concealed 

Recording: (8755/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8756/ 9621) 
right right and that yeah and again if it is criminal activity you want some you want somebody to stop it and know about it but if it is i i am not doing anything i want anybody to know about so you know i am am everybody to prevent them from going to the same idea i want some companies doing what research they that is a that is a right on the web too is that you can connect into somebody is system and they do not know you are there and you can see what they are doing if they are doing research uh you know developing a new product or something you can you know it is corporate i spend charge and i am sure that is going on i have heard cases of it yeah well and the thing is people are real sharp no matter what you do they will find a way or what you know they have found a way to prevent people from getting in and people are real good about finding new ways to do it 

Recording: (8757/ 9621) 
but it it teaching him discipline responsibility you can not do these things at this time you know i 

Recording: (8758/ 9621) 
i i am sure it makes it easier but i think that a person can establish a relationship you just have to put the effort into it and just like to have that relationship and so i i think that even if i were working you know as my oldest daughter i worked by range my life around her so that even i had that degree i waited tables because when she was little before she started school i could go to work at five in the evening and she went to bed at seven thirty so i had her with with her all day now when she started school i switched over to lunches and so i have always arranged my life around my children so i have an opportunity to be with that

why are you doing it now but and then my my by youngest one she likes to dress totally different she is sort of like uh a little bit of a preppie but she uh does not i understand why people want to have like eyes on on their shirt or you know a name on their pants and she says i just think that is stupid she says you can buy nice clothes with out that so she is neither one of impression me and uh the one thing that was really odd when they were little is we would go like at toy is or us and up and down the roads and i and they would walk over and pick something up and go and then put it back down and keep walking and it is like you know i told just in the you know i feel like i am at over because are they terrified to even ask for this stuff and she goes no she says they do not want it she says they just want to see what like you know because their favorite storm when they were little is i would go to um what do you call it lazy boy and get five or six of them killer boxes from the sofa and the chairs and take a nice and cut doors in it and they would play with that for weeks you know until somebody one of their friends would come over and have a little accident in and then we go well we have to build a new house but you know they just reading and playing with stuff like that they they enjoy it you know so

Recording: (8788/ 9621) 
no they should talk about i think they should talk about that too um i never i never did it and i you know i wish i could have waited so i was married but i you know you are going through that whatever you go see when you are a teenager so you are like so what well most kids i am not you know some people some kids still do that but i think i guess i do think they should put that in it also that 

Recording: (8789/ 9621) 
i work at uh company company plus i help out at the bba no butlerin is association

Recording: (8799/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (8800/ 9621) 
yeah see they adjusted that but then they did not have anyway to um enforce that so 

Recording: (8801/ 9621) 
hopefully 

Recording: (8802/ 9621) 
<laugh> no i know i am definitely in favor of that i mean yes it is the parents it is the parent is supposed to do it and one would hope that the parent would get there before before they help quite did but if the parent is not going to get there just the only way they are ever going to find out 

Recording: (8803/ 9621) 
that is what we figure in a few years they will be fine it is just getting there it is been very difficult i mean as kind of as we did not know where he was for a week or a time uh a week at a time here i just drive in the main avenue once and so i am bagging money on the street and that is it is it is pretty heavy load to go through it really is 

Recording: (8804/ 9621)

Recording: (8808/ 9621) 
been you know with people coming back later and saying that uh they need to change their mind and stuff because the adoptive parents i would be concerned about that but they would it is not going to happen in this case i do not think and it because of for asianist and this sounds to me the state law says that she has to have custody of child for seventy two hours before she can give it up for a doctor uh because of her age and it does not make any sense to me but so they you know they are talking to a social worker now to find out they do not want to take the baby home because they are afraid of being too attached to it then and they do not think it is a good atmosphere for it because her mother is smokes constantly her mother is alcoholic um 

Recording: (8809/ 9621) 
because you do have to have the higher education most of the time to do anything these days so they definitely have to have their 

Recording: (8810/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8811/ 9621)

Recording: (8812/ 9621) 
actually you can have well they usually go together some kids have learn disabilities without the a phd and some have a phd without the learning disability and some have of both and you can have he without having the hyper active part you can have the tension deficit in this order with what they call high pay tax activity and that is the student that is kind of spacey and kind of dreamy and they never cause any trouble but they are kind of like out of touch with the oldity and they are always looking out the wind i know and like the other one that says i did not hear what what was the question and uh they are they are ad and they can not quite focus and they came screen out the extractions but because they are not hyper they are not always doing this and they are not bothering people they are kind of the they are the one is that usually get lost in the shuttle those are the kids that are real cooperative and they are always smiling they are kind of spaced out and daydream and and takes a long time to realize and this kid can not focus but with the kid that is all over the place and doing the to happen to this kid is chair and then kid goes make him stop in my chair you know <laugh> you you can see right away that he can not focus because when he asked you for help you can over to explain something to him he is like all over the place while your explaining is not listening to eat you are trying to show him something i mean will not look at it you know it is like people often say edd kids can not focus or can not attend to anything but what is really happening is they attend everything 

Recording: (8813/ 9621) 
by stars what is your major need of pointing finger paints journalism and uh medicine okay cross is okay that gives our uh younger people some mentorors look after does not it and where are your scores in those the oh i am uh gee i am just barely getting by beaupon is words yeah but that is a problem we have lack of standards no that is they are right keep a private but no i wish those guys would just spell hey i am a majoring in accounting i majoring in finance i majoring in business and i got three i got two point six oh and where are the criteria to play on the team why are not you playing this week well i am practicing i am still required to practice even though i can not play this week why can not you play this is it is a rule what rule well if i do not make certain things during the week which is academic i still have to perform uh sports wise make that commitment but and if i do not fall if i fall through that then i do not have the tina period but those are things that need need to be uh publicized more i understand say well hey we brought this much ticket gate this month and he got this of course and this percentage of that we need to expand more on that so that the younger people have better old models to look at and not just playing roundball or the the spiral we need to get them out there and say how you got perform in school you know i am sure michael reds got some you know beenterers out there you see guys where number five and the way the number is eight and the way it was okay they get there is a reason for it but what is what is what is the other part of it we do not do it because why we do not want to bring them up though we do not want to bring them from the embarrassment possibly or but that is part of life when they get out in the road well i am talking about these guys some of them will be successful in terms of whoever and some of them will be successful in other people eyes but the thing is show the kids they are watching them hey there is more than just sports sports is a backpack here going to the high state

yeah it is a good idea 

Recording: (8929/ 9621) 
the court 

Recording: (8930/ 9621) 
but then again i feel like sometimes i am so naive i mean a lot of that was not introduced and it was just like well should i have known that 

Recording: (8931/ 9621) 
yes they do 

Recording: (8932/ 9621) 
and i do not know whether or not he is never said anything he is but uh i think money out of could be uh do not tell and you know uh the the guys that come out very boondly and they ever of uh publicizing it and all that i do not see what they expect to gain inine they uh in fact they do not i do not think that they do gain anything by us 

Recording: (8933/ 9621) 
yeah but my new grandma <laugh> 

Recording: (8934/ 9621) 
i think one of the thing is that we when when you are backtides that you are really supposed to help other people to the like if if somebody gives you a gift you want to give it to someone else but it is easy a lot of times just to fall into the you know like well it is not letting anyone know what you believe and just so that they think oh what are those weirdos you know they do not wear makeup or whatever but we we can wear makeup so we want <laugh> but so i think for a lot of times people do fall in just sort of but i i was not raised it moreman so i have a lot of my family and friends who are still not members of the church and also because it is so new to me that i and just you know i will talk about it with anybody and and and so and i am also not afraid of people who are not more minutes they think if you grow up like a member of the church and you might be more afraid of people that do not believe like you have been taught uh i think a lot of it you know we do not drink alcohol we do not there is a lot of restrictions i guess you call them restrictions but they are about um i feel like they are or more just health codes to keep you healthy and so um it might be it is like if we if america you know we are used to being raised one way if we went to another country just kind of like you might want to get to know the chinese people but you might not quite be a little timid about you know it is the same kind of thing but i i am not i do not have any of those periods 

Recording: (8935/ 9621) 
wow i mean 

Recording: (8936/ 9621) 
pedly but uh 

Recording: (8937/ 9621) 
uh couple that are talking to the baby we get counseling for her 

Recording: (8938/ 9621) 
well your fifty five or or is it sixty two whatever age is an age limitation age or you base one age or disability or being out of town uh you are allowed uh so routinelyly we have uh done the out of i mean done the uh absentee over the years no going back to basic politicians i i i think we have uh i think the last majority uh are truly good honest people they try to mean well i am i am concerned always that uh people who go into politics are in fine shape when they start but that the tremendous influences are brought to bear that they never had had the opportunity to comprehend before they got there and they are just overwhelmed it it and i do not necessarily i think it is a it is a a dishonesty it is like a title way they get caught up and they can not resist the direction it is being push or they are being pushed 

Recording: (8939/ 9621) 
and now it is our turn to deal with the issues we see our parents we see this generation that all these things they are still populous so we do not look down on the sixty i mean i think the sixty sounds like a pretty fun time to live i will get into politics in a second um but those things are popularized but no we can not do it any more because we have got these problems um 

Recording: (8940/ 9621) 
well i will come back i mean you need me to 

Recording: (8941/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (8942/ 9621) 
and just sort of like uh whenever it comes on i roll my eyes that episode where they were stuck out in space and uh just if the tape can catch me rolling my eyes oh

Recording: (8947/ 9621) 
well it yeah but what would you send it if you could send it to one of the tv rooms that have like uh oprah one fairer is that one thing that can get it all over the world you know all over the united states or something so people really here maybe we might do some good people to begin to speak up you know why do not they start some type of a television program with questions like this and what to people really think it would help do instead of having things like open and thin who is those other couple guys that get on to ask the most stupid questions and 

Recording: (8948/ 9621)

Recording: (8956/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (8957/ 9621)

Recording: (8958/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (8959/ 9621) 
you like the university level 

Recording: (8960/ 9621) 
actually being able to to recent the funding but still i mean it is a it is we do not like to think about these things happening 

Recording: (8961/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (8962/ 9621) 
and i do not know whether i am not i do not think the second sister ever went to school out there but uh they used worse tough but and mom had taught school in iowa where she grew up and uh got her teacher is certificate so i guess in they would agree that if they could find someone to they would ask answer to the day she could tech 

Recording: (8963/ 9621) 
no not really i do not know what even is to eat down here awfullys 

Recording: (8964/ 9621)

Recording: (8965/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (8966/ 9621) 
it is just like being good numbers 

Recording: (8967/ 9621) 
um it is kind of funny you are allowed to drink before you are allowed to drive 

Recording: (8968/ 9621) 
i was a baby you know under one <laugh> 

Recording: (8969/ 9621) 
there is too much information and too much change uh library is that this is against probably what the image of library is that they are very very eager to impress change uh internet came out and you know when it and when it got out of the area it was being used by universities or whatever for research that sort of was at first my brain are right there and they want it more and more and they want to figure out what they can do with it uh with pcs yeah we just you know it was revolutions i have been asked that we could use ibm pcs to access to the system if we provide you software you can do some of the work that you used it doing but but that in your computer and it is like it was incredible the uh we had trouble with the demand it was you know they triple what we expected my brian is were ready for it 

Recording: (8970/ 9621) 
and uh it it is great we have been re engineered the last eight years oh downizing and trying to fit the uh uh fit the i guess the what the person brings to work as opposed to uh one of the problems that i see as an as an employer or as a supervisor manager and in other times we have to promote because well the bureaucracy says you have to do this in order come up there they do not quite consider getting the attutes of the person is has and so now we are saying okay you bring this attitude to the state able and you can help the team out then why not reward you instead of putting you over here in let us say a man is jury jury position which you we do not have any call for them but you are there because of the money only okay so we are trying to fit the attitude to the person and compensate them accordingly which uh hey i think we did that we would probably have more teachers 

Recording: (8971/ 9621) 
and why do not people use their time you know and it is free you know rather they get all fenced up and mad because they less five minutes late and expect everybody to get out of other way because they got to get there you know 

Recording: (8972/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (8973/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (8974/ 9621)

Recording: (8975/ 9621) 
there is no need to attack students over it and i read some article in the land or i do not know why read that um um i hate that paper anyway um i read some the called of the guy said he is not trying to attack students he just wants them to get enough so they will go fine to their parents about how the university does it and then they can all fight the establishment and 

Recording: (8976/ 9621) 
but like if you said i drive a bus service will go and pick you guys up you know and then then you can not use the excuse my car broke down or something and then like if you even to give them like it does not even have to be hot you know i would think for breakfast or anything you know if you run three shifts you can just you know here is a box of dough or something you know and that does not cost the company that much can 

Recording: (8977/ 9621) 
ah just a player you know i mean they lost a four or five different uh top notch players they went to the pros and most of them are starting or you know so uh oh cooper is thing is we do not rebuild we unload you know well sometimes it takes a couple years to unload you know but i have never been a guy i have not seen a cooperated so i was listening to a or not corby uh some show on wtv and i listen to talk shows and everything and uh he supposedly has said something to uh he had got ready to assistant coach so he supposedly said something to one assistant coach that did you know i would like to hard you and everything but you are not the right color you know i mean that is not something that you would think the head coach of the high state would say you know 

Recording: (8978/ 9621)

Recording: (8981/ 9621) 
um i helped them set up different things helped them you know clean them up afterwards prep patients all kinds of different things it was a lot of blood and stuff i do not know when when it is not you it seems a little <laugh> easier to observe i guess yeah when you see somebody you know it is a little more concerning to you i do not know but you see a lot of different stuff and you hope that the majority of it is helping this person out now my wife you know she works she worked in intensive care open art surgery different patients like that and that is a lot different than where she is now with the cancer because there is so many for in fact she says it is so hard to see somebody thirty years old and they come in and they have a express can or something like that and you have to go in and tell them these things she says you know two or three times a week you know your your heart just drops out because you see that they have their little kids and now you are going to be going for chemicals you know all this stuff you know and it is unbelievable how many it is just hard to believe how many people go through there they are talking fifty sixty patients that 

Recording: (8982/ 9621) 
you know and i mean it do not matter to me whether your black or white it matters to me whether way you treat me like when i first got out of services when they really started off on the actually i was gonna get a job in the truck in the industry and they clean up i mean because that was one that first come down to the manate that they could only hire blacks 

Recording: (8983/ 9621)

Recording: (9031/ 9621)

Recording: (9035/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9036/ 9621) 
yeah i think so i think so and they they just you know the candidates really seem like they have that much integrity to me you know so 

Recording: (9037/ 9621) 
that is probably family by family i means that we <laugh> that is why i was a little bit late leaving work the way it was there there we have got two coworkers one um how is her child with the same day cares as myself she is about a year now and i am listening to her and i mean she is there you know sixty seventy hours a week i mean she is dropped off at six am and not picked up till six thirty p m and she is fine with that me personally there is no way cause somebody has totally in my opinion raising that child you are not getting to put your values your traditions what is important to you onto that child uh the other girls she just has a four month old in has been in day care now for three weeks and she is going to go she she is going to quit her job and go to um um night work the nights three days a week because it is important to her to be at home with him 

Recording: (9038/ 9621) 
so she so i probably did learn a little bit because i i she still that she lives with the man now and he does all the cooking still so i have i have learned everything on my own upon cooking and stuff like that which i did love to cook 

Recording: (9039/ 9621) 
i think society is today uh today is less tolerant of uh a lot of things that they see where people getting along with this stuff you know and they are more vocal boy back in the sixties and stuff you know uh not here but you down south there people still getting hung and stuff you know for being a black or something and uh you know there are bad blacks and there are bad whites too you know so but not all them or uh you know or that 

Recording: (9040/ 9621) 
um plus if they shoot somebody accidently number one it is really hard to and secondly they probably will kill them like a gun can um and you have to brain so i did not come from a hunting background um but my husband does work for the stay our patrols obviously you mean there a lot of people that have to carry guns but none of them hardly any of them hunt um you know a lot of them they were to respect them if you know what i mean they realize they can kill people well you do get some of the you know much easier to people than just wanna go out and shoot things and yeah yeah i i yeah i do not it is not the guns it is the problem it is the people that are teaching 

Recording: (9041/ 9621) 
um so i am sure that probably increases the rate of public schools for them 

Recording: (9042/ 9621) 
um i do more summer sports but um he is just beginning on the computer um on pretty computer literally i have really never had a job again it is always been working with to it or plan

um-hum 

Recording: (9044/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9045/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (9046/ 9621) 
and you register them and then you just keep after them you keep giving them information and then you just run a good get out the vote campaign uh in ohio i think it is easier to do that because there is a law that i do not think it is in primaries but in general elections at eleven oclock in the morning and four oclock in the afternoon they have to list those who have voted they have to put up a list of uh registered voters and cross out those who voted so what i used to do was i took my list that i had gotten from the board of elections earlier and compared it with my list of who had shone support or was undecided on the election and i would cross off those that had voted and then i had a list of those that had not and i had people waiting at a a phone bank and i would call them at work or at home and and i would offer to take them to the polls if you do not have a ride uh we will take you to the polls if you are worried about these young and watching your kids we have sort of fight teachers who will sit in the car with your kid or will sit in your home and will babysit for you while you go to vote because i have also read studies that say people who are are rounded from their home where their office you know to remind it to go vote will also vote for whatever issue or candidate has reminded them to do that because what i did was this is a very low key thing i would call people on election day and say hi this is roberto i am calling to remind you that today is election day and we hope that you will remember to exercise your most important freedom which is go vote and oh by the way uh when you go to vote we hope that you will vote for us that is in such a school levy and if you need a ride let me know we have got them set up for you and but you know that that is very i mean and and that is not getting people to vote and encourage them to vote because they should that is a a special campaign for a particular issue or a candidate i do not know how you get people to vote i do not know why they do not think it is important maybe because we have had it too easy my my grandfather did not my grandfather did not i mean there was a king and clean and you know he had no right to vote so when he came here and he could that was the most important thing in the world to him you know in that he he just bathadon to you know his daughter my mother my father i do not know well how he it was important to him but it was always important to him when we talked about politics at the dinner tables sometimes mine is we talked about issues and he said you know it is important to to be heard so i do not know if it was that it got passed on parentwise or what it was 

Recording: (9047/ 9621) 
um about fifteen minutes my mom and i do not go too far from each other so but jayson is going to take the week off and everything so i think that we will we will be able to do that

i do not want to get to it like the way we walk but i do not know what to do is find 

Recording: (9050/ 9621)

Recording: (9051/ 9621) 
wow when you get into the black population you sometimes see some

that and the people that enjoy you think why are you why are we hiring these guys you know what are they what are they thinking <laugh> 

Recording: (9188/ 9621) 
i blame it on that yeah because you know there is been a lot more kids that have died in school than you know just in the it was not in the big numbers at one time but there is been random violence in schools you know where kids of his died even more than and you know seven or whatever and i think that the media is just made into something that they have glamorousized it and some of the kids i think they are screwed up anyway and i am just like well hey you know i can do that and i will be on the yeah i do i think that is a big part of that because they will not their name is known and they do not care if they die anyway um-hum 

Recording: (9189/ 9621) 
actually they are they are working on it i am sorry to mention to them to that um they have they have um just in state had some bonus games where uh as the poverty level i think is considered um thirteen thousand pounds here um and if if you are below the poverty level and you do you go back to work you get a certain like extra bonus beyond yes so there is a bonus for back to work you mentioned early about like how that is going to affect the children with the two year welfare thing i mean at least i know a lot more about the systems there for for whatever reason than i do about this was through here which is kind of unfortunate but um there i mean i do not really think in a lot of situations of course i am sure there are people who follow as it should be and who who really need it and who really you know taking care of their children but unfortunately you do not really see that side very much you see that people who like their kids seeing on the that money you know they are left at home by themselves if if they can even you know get them to school if they even go to school if they are even bothered you know and you know those you know a lot of they are they are documentariesaries on all the time there so you really sort of it is more in your face and it is here that i ever noticed um but i do think and and with that they have specific programs for the children and um i think one of the problems too with the schools is the fact that you know if a if a kid has bad behavior or you know bad is not his you send them home i mean i think that is the most ridiculous thing like surely that is not a punishment for a lot of these kids and you know at least in england on these things i have seen you know they sent and i am home and these kids are just doing whatever going around the neighborhood shop lifting you know you know hot wiring cars at the age of you know ten or something and i do not know i think i do have some of these strong opinions about people you know who are having all these kids and do not take care of them at all

as a result of the one trying to force myself back into what they do so i mean it yeah i mean when it when you come down to these things there is uh people with mental illness and with the disability are trying to put on off the responsibility onto everybody but themselves you know while the medical doctor if they would have seen this guy in given him medication he would not have went out there and killed somebody you know should have would have put him in if the guy stopped taking his medication of his his own free will that was his responsibility to take the medicine every day just so i get is mine take mine every day and when i stopped taking mine that was my responsibility which just why i do not want to go to the legal system to try and make an excuse even though there is uh there is a some law that protects people that if they were drunk or on the influence of medication or or off the influence of medication um in case they bought a house or signed in it some kind of contract that they would not be liable

it it might i mean good teachers do that i i i still get upset when i was teaching school i did activity base teaching um and and i was doing some volunteer work at double in schools we were supposed to be one of the better schools in the area and i thought there would be all sorts of creative things going on and there was not it was still read the chapter right the answers to the question infor them to be into the book and i thought how boring i mean there are different ways to get kids turned on to things um i am not sure there is so much influence from the media uh and i say media broad base you would be it print media or tv um it has this culture today of um a stars and you know media of uh phenomenalous and and they do not see the relevantance and i do not think they hear from their parents like guisone of the importance of voting and that is where it comes from their parents do not vote so if their parents do not vote they are not you know again i do not know what the the answer is uh um but it is very scary what is going to happen in the next couple of generations the only good thought for me is i think about this is that i will not be here to see the is in to grace of the democracy although i have great faith too i have great faith in democracy um there are always good people that somehow come up and i think if they are we are any issue i think kids would get if if there were kids in college that were being drafted and being sent to die in a war that people did not think was important or had no real relevant the issue right now is that there is nothing there

Recording: (9269/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (9270/ 9621) 
or that are having kids and i mean we talk about that is all we do is sit there and talk about our kids and what they are doing and how our parents and then react to like there was this girl that just got in there today and and her parents really flipping out because she was pregnant and um we were telling them we were all telling her about oh you know um it it is always starts out that way and they will eat you up later on 

Recording: (9271/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (9272/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (9273/ 9621) 
i know 

Recording: (9274/ 9621) 
at that time in the uh thirties 

Recording: (9275/ 9621) 
do you want this do not only this this and that some people some people some people say that i feel sorry for those people i pray for those people because persum those wonderful thing you can have just going to get you through nothing else i do not care whats of that challenge you have in front of you you put it in his hands you know enough faith to practice it they will come through they may come through this way you you think it is you want it to but somewhere on the line you are going to say uh ah for some reason i am i am supposed to do this i can not explain it but you are always looking for reasons you are asking me i do not look at the reason but a lot of times you can not give a reason it just happens why did you married your husband why did you how would you meet your husband how did you come about how the passing of two explain it to your spring someday 

Recording: (9276/ 9621) 
they help him 

Recording: (9277/ 9621) 
those are i i think you were implying those are needs to those people but they are not uh so how old we correct some of this you have got to i think we have got to cut out a lot of this luxury we have got to slowly bring quote the family back home uh and i do not necessarily say it has to be the woman versus the man who cares in today is work uh we are a far last in my country culturally uh we are poor more in service or in station and manufacturing or in station uh so uh a man and and it uh man or woman may be free to phrase a woman can do most of the work as being done outside of the home today versus what they could have done as agricultural people uh and so once again though that would bring people back to this central family make up just has to be communications communications as it is going uh that it is irreverable uh i i think it can be redistrected in much in the manner of your speaking uh and and where does this start i think i am gonna start back here in first grade i think parents must participate with teachers uh as we used to uh with this common in a you could walk in and sit down and uh watch the students or participate with participate and or assist uh what today they had have these assistants but they are hired directed assistants they are not in their portraying or or passing their own their values of the community to the students uh so i think that is i i guess i come up i will continue to come back to family to family almost everything has got to be going back to family bring that family back together and get them to communicate on that personal basis not that impersonational basis 

Recording: (9278/ 9621) 
because they are they are they are saying you are still a kid but yet 

Recording: (9279/ 9621)

Recording: (9305/ 9621) 
i do it so i think that would probably be about the biggest difference is just really the amount of education you get 

Recording: (9306/ 9621) 
you can not especially with kids just to overwhelming 

Recording: (9307/ 9621) 
really why this guy is close to japan

you know am very much in favor of gun control very strong gun control uh right and it they just seem to be too available uh of then some of the things that schools are doing about that you know the kid that comes to school with a paper gun gets suspense that is a little much but 

Recording: (9310/ 9621) 
i think that is great you know i think obviously there is always a down side and but i think that too many people abuse the system and you know unfortunately it is very hard when you know then it ruins it for the people who really do need it and but you know as long as they have you know created a system whereby you know it will not be obviously as good for those people as it has been the ones who are genuinely unemployed but you know i think depending on how um sort of focus they are on the individual schools in their area or whatever however it divided up i do not know hopefully not special treatment but obviously you would try to here than more in whichever direction they are most suited for you know as far as far as maybe like the volunteer work because i mean you know there is so much volunteering to be done everyway and even if you do not have you know if you are lacking in whatever way you would think that you can you know they there is something you know hopefully that i do not know

acumcumbils or whatever you know and uh you know he is pretty much pissed off the rest of the way up there because uh i was right 

Recording: (9342/ 9621) 
my answer to your question is how is this eroded i am going to answer with the we are using the word respect uh yes i feel that uh this has eroded over time uh there is not the respect for our elders i do not oh necessarily menialers in terms of the uh chronald age but i am talking in terms of generations uh uh there is an last respect for the father less respect for the mother less respect for the grandparents and the reagan grandparents uh not only gave you a first hand example uh i just had a uh conversation with one of my granda daughter is who is now twenty uh she will come over to my house grandaul is house and will come in and she will flop down in a chair uh and she will do nothing in that household even if you suggest it uh i do not have you ever tell her uh to to do things and i have pointed out too that whenever we went to visit grandma or greatgrandfather uh if the if we saw weeds out in the garden we went out and we hope to garden if we if it was chicken house need to be cleaned uh and they had not gotten to it that day we went out and cleaned chicken house we would say grandma they said okay we go out and clean your chicken out well of course you knew very well i was gonna be okay but i matter of respect though you asked okay is it okay for us to do it and uh now with her uh i can have dishes out there in the sink uh that are they have up there for from breakfast and maybe lunch and uh she she will walk out there i do not know say well grab a whole lot of these dishes are not done uh she turns around walks away a a that is right uh-huh and and she made me they can go ahead and she went on sometimes she will ask she does but let us assume she did she asked is it all right if i have some of these she goes ahead and gets the dishes out and throw forth she puts them right down that sink uh with those other dishes makes new way for us to clean them and and i i i have seen this in many many many incum but i am going to be going to this is very first and i know this and i strongly suspect that this is a typical typical thing in our society today so yes in my opinion and and definitely it is eroding i know you are talking a little different approach in answering a question uh from over the time that that this kind of thing is eroding the base upon the word respect of yeah no you are not talking about thirteen you need your hair or you need your own wine and wine and your and your and your and your and your and your and your and your and your and your and your and your and your and your and your and your and your and your and your and youryou i do not even wanna be able to bring over to bring to bring to thegetting it oh oh ah i do not know there you would be a lot more room anyway oh yeah i know that uh i would try very very hard i got uh-huh i have a girl i would care if we found all of the little girl and then the boy i would wait and i would do college you think they can catch me doing something that would be something to me <laugh> you need to start a story first thing to do you need to start the video on the uh the cherry fire and a half a mile later and you used the line and i had not put any children in the board yeah and just started starting to build and i said i am fat or something that i would not even wanna be down here on the jewelry you know yeah <laugh> yes so i know my wife was you know people in her house and i was full of those uh-huh well i have i had the whole business that is about very juryous and you get <laugh> going to find new if and they are going to find new if they are going to do not find new if they are going to do not find new if they are going to do not find new i think all i found on them on the last way they are doing it but i think i do not like them on them on them on them <laugh> yeah uh-huh yeah but it also the fear on the fact that these people and there is too many overdoers right now i do not think before the to many people ever got this right or at least somebody is that the people they uh it it in general the situation is got that way i am just reading the older people in the morning she just used the word penalty uh penalty has lots of different death conditions each individual has uh mental picture of what the word penalty means based upon their own no i want to take just an you say penalty in a very general sort of way whatever your extremes to the right or to the left let us come back to about the middle i am concerned that we are getting away from penalties beauponaldly and i feel it is absolutely essential that we have penalties we have for everyone for everyone yeah across the board uh we we are getting away from penalty we are getting away from penalty uh uh so many people i just to give you an example well the talking about adults i just read a a statistic the other day right here the city of columbus where uh was in an extremely high percent i can not quote to percentage of people who uh ignore uh yellow lights and and of consequently they are in they have going through red lights and there are many many many the taking place uh all right and it we it used to be that you could place uh uh on the law enforcement officer at the corner of the half benus you would uh penalize you by getting your ticket in your face they cord as up as may be well now we have passed so many little and laws and changes the enforcement policies and this kinds of thing where they poor police officer he can not even do that any longer he is got it is somebody that runs through red light you almost have to hit somebody and then be accused for going through the red light he can not just arebyly beat it because that is called oh i think we are harassment pleased apart you are harassmenting an individual because you were standing there waiting for him to commit this problem without let us just get it away from that example you can talk about whether you you were carrying uh i am going to get into the guns and knives and stuff and in the school with and up 

Recording: (9343/ 9621) 
you know i think a lot of times you know people are not real rational as far as as who they they go for

Recording: (9346/ 9621) 
their ideas and they mean the guys are trying to look older the girls are trying to look younger 

Recording: (9347/ 9621) 
i think because of the movies and i think of nintendo and all those games that they have on there i think that really does spark things and little children is minds and even you know like in junior high then oh yeah we could do that you know and there is just so much violence and when we were growing up there was not any violence on tv we were allowed to watch it but you know i mean i mean the comics for it violent uh now which is too open for kids the parents you know they say the parents should monitor yeah

exactly 

Recording: (9365/ 9621)

Recording: (9366/ 9621) 
i have not seen any fights i have not seen anyone get shot i mean when you read about it in the land but the only thing that i was really shocked about was the people begging on high street 

Recording: (9367/ 9621)

Recording: (9368/ 9621) 
but you know i mean one he was about nine years old but he is known me all my life so you know and i mean it was not a big shock 

Recording: (9369/ 9621) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (9370/ 9621) 
that they fired him like that the night before the michigan game see then the next day he came down on the field with a black suit and a fadorour of you know a hat he looks so cool you know because she will turn he always wears a tie i do not know he just he he is a great coach 

Recording: (9371/ 9621) 
yeah um and this is something i have thought about a lot because if i had stayed in cincinnati say where it is very uh conservative you know not real open to new things or if i had stayed in the east coast where of course it would be really competitive i i probably would not be working at the free answer today i came to columbus there was not you know there was not much going on when i came here 

Recording: (9372/ 9621) 
oh really 

Recording: (9373/ 9621) 
yeah it it is she does not even drive to work you know 

Recording: (9374/ 9621) 
we are stopped at one of their defensive lines 

Recording: (9375/ 9621) 
but then you do not have that people running the machinery and checking the machinery 

Recording: (9376/ 9621)

Recording: (9379/ 9621) 
yeah yeah yeah i it surpriseses neat to hear to find that that columbus is in so out of shape um but i am in the uh you know in the circle that i move in uh everybody is for middle age and they all quit smoking and they all all of the sudden trying to beat off the beep and um uh so you know i mean well and of course they were always hippies and eight spouts and twigs and leaves anyway you know so they you know that is a sort of circle i move in but i know because i take have these part time jobs from time to time i see a whole different group of people and i can say it is probably oh i 

Recording: (9380/ 9621) 
humum 

Recording: (9381/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9382/ 9621) 
just 

Recording: (9383/ 9621) 
so once you can then to people there is nothing to be scared of here and there is nothing to be scared of there nothing to and then they start to play and once you start playing you start learning 

Recording: (9384/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9385/ 9621) 
and and much and much other things you know that i am coming to understand 

Recording: (9386/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9387/ 9621) 
we did not know you know anything about what he did or we found out more um after he died 

Recording: (9388/ 9621) 
yeah and 

Recording: (9389/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9390/ 9621) 
yeah yeah that is another thing i hear about that 

Recording: (9391/ 9621) 
you know they never asked for extra money and uh they had to cut back on everything and they i think it just set people back now we are trying real hard to catch up and at some point we are going to uh you know have to put levy on again and and uh who knows what is happened we are keeping rose of smith right now because she is so good pr with uh with the business community but the business community in columbus does not really support the schools and they do not i mean we have got two new uh stadiums and we have not got any increase in school funny 

Recording: (9392/ 9621) 
yeah but my oldest she is the oldest uh she is got three kids one her oldest is by a different guy and her new husband adopted her because they she never sees them um and then they got two other girls and they live together they go to the house you know their own they are going through marriage they have been together for like five years and they are not going they are not doing very well right now but hopefully you know they will get over that and then i got a older brother who um them and his girlfriend moved in together and they just had a baby 

Recording: (9393/ 9621) 
so they i have always used insurance but i had no doctor at the time and they went and met me they were going to make me wait two months before they did anything and what i did i had my wife drive drive me down to the hospital and i crawl down to the car and crawled in the hospital until the other met me or i crawled out the door 

Recording: (9394/ 9621) 
yeah and it is been five years this year that we have been married and uh close to seven that i have known him so and it is still just exciting it still just as good yeah he am am amazes me every day because i am i am one of these will not last forever but you know <laugh> and he goes like well we are ninety you know you will know <laugh> so 

Recording: (9395/ 9621) 
so uh he finally decided uh you know after oh well i went him to catholic school they kept his keep his dusts in the hallway you know 

Recording: (9396/ 9621) 
why i mean it is part of the script that you say you believe and a hundred percent and why do not you why do not you talk about it and the problem is that they do not they do not know the canter and if they do not know the answer if they can not give a firm this is the answer then they avoid it um and i try and find for me what has become the best answer you know if i do not if i do not if i do not believe something or i do not know what to believe about something i will go i will find an answer for myself i am not going to take somebody else is answer and if i do take someone else is answer they better be able to back it up you know yeah yeah yeah yeah oh i know a lot of people who do you but i know a lot of people that do not um-hum um-hum um-hum um did not see a logical discussions no no unless unless you are seeking not out i mean i go to the vineyard church it is up in it is up in uh uh westernville and there is about there is about probably six thousand of us it is one of the biggest churches in ohio and uh if you want to find something in that church you can find it you can find a discussion group about anything it is just just a matter of finding it and within any within any denominationation or within any religion you go as deep as you want to go you know there are people who just go on sunday mornings there are people just going east or there are people who go monday wednesday tuesday stay and then sunday nights and saturday nights and are very very very into that and i mean i am not the monday tuesday wednesday thursday type but i am pretty involved i am pretty involved um-hum the community the community um the church is designed as a community of other christians it is not necessarily designed as um i heard this in a dorm and this is really good um it is not designed as a congressman comes in and says way to go past your you go do it we are going to cheer you on the job of a and there are a lot of churches who have totally forgotten that that is what their original yeah that is what the that is what christian supposed to do and that is what our church does 

Recording: (9397/ 9621) 
wow 

Recording: (9398/ 9621) 
and that is actually a really interesting thing too because especially coming back you know in moving on my stuff out of storage i have just been on this you know i am getting rid of half so every thing i own because over there it is you know it just feels so weird to come back and i feel so loaded on it especially when i have spent so much time just living out of the suitcase you know i just really realized i have so much stuff but i do not need because they are you know everyone has just sort of like a little closet with clothes you know there is not stuff all around everything is more expensive so every one has a lot less and here it is like everything is so relatively inexpensive that it is like you know picture frame or something there it might be you know twenty five dollars for one so you buy one none here oh you know they are five dollars a piece let us buy five you know 

Recording: (9399/ 9621) 
and that is what i am saying it toning for thin quite a bureaucracy when you get a church telling you that you need to ask for forgive this one what they would did i mean in the church inf came up where i went and buried my grandparents and went to all my life over the door the church as a picture of christian for climas with a missionaryary a pleased and always been with his sore drawn a dead native american in his feet and three more at the side looking on in fear now i had the priest cold heart question 

Recording: (9400/ 9621)

Recording: (9407/ 9621)

Recording: (9462/ 9621) 
yeah that is what it seems i mean i i know it is like i mean it is the same proportion i mean there are more old people there but it just seems more apparent just because of how you can like go out sit all the time yeah i mean there is never like three or four months where you just want to sit in your house and 

Recording: (9463/ 9621) 
you know it is like look you always think i could you know look i am doing really well look how wonderful everything is

i think the news media have typed it up too much really i mean we have an accord with cuba that says anyone that is trying to escape from cuba united states has found it see is immediately turn to cuba whether you agree with it or not that is the accord and that is what that is what castro is that is that is the premiseating on uh you know in the news media they have not really been up it they it is just have not been real objective about it i mean uh you know like they are two fisher i found him at see you never hear about the other one because uh this was on one just briefly i heard on the news because he thinks he should go back to his father but you do not hear about him there is three a cousin is two of them think he should stay the my amy the other one thinks he should get back with this father you do not hear about him is reading about him newsweek or some place uh uh so i think the news media is not being totally objective about this 

Recording: (9465/ 9621) 
um you know it is stuff like that it is like it is kind of neat because you do not have to pay well you have to pay for it but like magazines 

Recording: (9466/ 9621) 
but we still need to have property management records that is very essential you know a lot of times when you are talking to engineers they do not realize that part of it uh they do not like the detail at least that to have to pass back of it uh but we need to have a lot of that because you need to know how uh your uh facilities are structured uh the time history any type of uh activity on that whether it is been uh installed or removed relocated where my be but we need to know that how the head impact upon the design of a particular uh facility voice and data 

Recording: (9467/ 9621)

yep 

Recording: (9533/ 9621)

Recording: (9534/ 9621) 
right that is good 

Recording: (9535/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (9536/ 9621) 
i am gonna let him choose i really am i think as long i mean i really do not care what religion he is i mean with my husband i really did not care if he turned catholic or not i do think religion is important and whatever that religion is to him and he has a place to go to pray to be with his family and other people i think that is important if he wants to be catholic great if he does not that is okay too oh 

Recording: (9537/ 9621) 
but i mean that is just sort of the curious nature of the kids i mean they obviously they are going to get into stuff and things like that and i mean it is not always the parents is fault i mean i do not there are a lot of people i mean i interest in the news a few weeks ago they had a shooting cabin a couple of years ago and they just came diverted on it and the parent like left it in the top of the tooshed that was locked in the cage where the key was he climbed up on the ladder unlocked and he ended up shooting himself with it i mean as far there is really nothing more he can do i mean 

Recording: (9538/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9539/ 9621) 
oh projects that right from fancy words i was designing the projects first of all we had to find out what we had with the best sure and as everyone should know even and as a residential user you have to know what you have in your house the talking company does not provide it service to you anymore um well we had no we had throughout the seeveahio and some eighty eight counties and uh wherever else number of facilities we had and so we went on a sca dohunt 

Recording: (9540/ 9621) 
the way i could discipline at the home 

Recording: (9541/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9542/ 9621) 
right well that is something i have noticed in the local news particularly lately they say up to uh an up to uh a little up on our channel and stuff and it is usually not that big of a deal what they are talking about uh but they are making a big point that you heard this year first and i mean if you hear it five minutes over here on one station then what differences it makes 

Recording: (9543/ 9621) 
um but yeah i do not know i think yeah i think it is like there is like a real age either or it is it is old people who are there retiring or whatever and or it is more of like a younger people there i know you do not see a lot i do not know there is middle age people there but it is not so apparently this year i guess 

Recording: (9544/ 9621) 
um and i mean it was a pretty good place i mean looking back on it i remembered a lot better than when i was actually there 

Recording: (9545/ 9621) 
yeah but fifty years ago if you had apple up see they would lock you in the closet and throw it to key we would let you out most of the parents i have seen uh to me i would rather see the kids of the stepparent 

Recording: (9546/ 9621) 
i worked for a company called highlights for children 

Recording: (9547/ 9621)

have no idea <laugh> 

Recording: (9556/ 9621) 
right well 

Recording: (9557/ 9621) 
right and and you are not as close to your family and the traditions and uh and i think you lose all of that and then you get so wrapped up in work and moving that i do not think kids have the center based of the family that they used to have and i do not know the the culture is just so fast to pay that i do not think people are maybe it is not honesty maybe it is just they do not have as much time to get attached and but right as you move on again you just do not get as close to people as you used to 

Recording: (9558/ 9621) 
and you know people do not have big families like they used to you know so 

Recording: (9559/ 9621) 
help them yeah 

Recording: (9560/ 9621) 
that is just ridiculous too though but yeah to me that is really weird i do not like i said i do not know what they are what they are thinking and over their thought process was but i am thinking maybe it is just social because a lot to me our high school is real social 

Recording: (9561/ 9621) 
well that gets back to what you are saying almost in the family life hey what is the you do not need a husband no he needs a burn bank that is what you are saying are not you are not you

Recording: (9563/ 9621)

Recording: (9564/ 9621) 
i think <laugh> um-hum 

Recording: (9565/ 9621)
