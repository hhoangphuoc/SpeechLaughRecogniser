well uh my uh grandmother was uh ill 

Recording: (7/ 9621) 
three three out of my four children do belong to the catholic church and then my one daughter chose uh living in oklahoma she is in aeded church but she is very active within the church very active through the sunday school and 

Recording: (8/ 9621) 
right but the ones the racing are the ones that are the standards in the fields but right if i would born more and more of those are also available on the way up but you have to subscribe to them so it is still an institutional subscription you know i mean that is the constant problem for the serial people everywhere and it just it is incredible what is happening with the costs you know i mean i have seen articles that say some of them have gone up a thousand dollars a year 

Recording: (9/ 9621) 
but what what does it tell us about our people we are so naive we have got to look inside ourselves and say what can we bring to society that that that could be more beneficial and most the time it is listening 

Recording: (10/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (11/ 9621) 
yeah and makes it you know fun so you can actually see what you know your studying needs came to us you know you can go whole season you know seventeen eighteen and oh and nobody pretty much coming close to your standard and when you win all that money it is just like yeah when you lose all that money it is like that is it  i am going home  but i have known people uh gamble you know compulsively i mean it is like a gambous level and i could not really get into that number one i am not the richer person in the world the number two just low money here is one thing but when you are out there spending your car insurance money on it or ramp money then you get a real problem therei have seen guy do that to get down the side of the down and bet the bit the farm on one horse and we need to do anything for them 

Recording: (12/ 9621) 
i have learned a lot about cooking lately 

Recording: (13/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (14/ 9621) 
so i am trying to take my time do what i want to do yeah 

Recording: (15/ 9621) 
i am a senior and i just started that my art major in spring so i still have about four quarters left but i am a senior 

Recording: (16/ 9621) 
it is 

Recording: (17/ 9621) 
yeah it is projected like six years to take to finish some of these projects i do you know and you get to ohio there is that i do not know something on david david letterman had a picture of this and i think i have seen it before that big sign that says your tax dollars dollars at work you know and there is the construction guy smoking a lot of leading up against the side kind of thing  it is kind of funny 

Recording: (18/ 9621) 
it is just the way it is i guess but it is like you know she says if the mother is in the house the mother is on duty 

Recording: (19/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (20/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (21/ 9621) 
right right but at least we had the stuff outside to look at to keep us interested in in there with a lot of i have always loved to travel by car yeah it is it is fun and it is probably because of that early conditioning  i have been i have been in forty eight states 

Recording: (22/ 9621) 
no it was his mom ran away so what happened 

Recording: (23/ 9621) 
oh yeah by the 

Recording: (24/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (25/ 9621) 
yeah it is curious is not it 

Recording: (26/ 9621) 
i do not know um like i said i mean it something that i basically see it almost as being the same thing it is like cigarettes or whatever where i mean yeah it is bad for you there is a lot of tar into things like that but as far as what it the effect it does to you it is no worst than anything alcohol can do to you um so i mean i do not know i mean i am not sure if they should actually go as far as to legalize but i do not think it is really something that they need to really spend that much time trying to control drug problem wise the thing is coming in i mean i know i think like switzerland or somewhere like that where they legalize drugs and they basically do a government based where the government actually gives them out and government gets the money for it um i could almost see that as being almost a good idea here i mean obviously they could say people are going to do it no matter what i mean it is the same thing with guns if they want it they will get their hands on it does not matter what they have to do to it they will they will come by it um i mean actually i mean i could see that they could at least take the money from it and put it to a better use of some sorts if they did the same kind of thing 

Recording: (27/ 9621) 
because not only is he a chevenous pig but he is a big it too  a reason yeah so 

Recording: (28/ 9621) 
all you do is you just keep your records of of um you know what you spend on things and then there is a form you fill out and how much you have if you have taken any depreciation you know you need to basically put that back in in deduct your costs and then there is a percentage that goes on your schedule either goes on the front of your form that goes into your income and then it is just tax it is just no it is really not that hard 

Recording: (29/ 9621) 
i well i hope they keep it 

Recording: (30/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (31/ 9621) 
yeah i really really hate the fact of government trying to what to do 

Recording: (32/ 9621) 
yeah and i of a sudden think the freshman class just right along i think the freshmen would be a little bit tougher you know it would be tougher to be walking around you know in different areas like me i did not know where this hall was i was out there with fifty million holes around me and just stopped up once and i say where is lastb and they that way that is too far from our part 

Recording: (33/ 9621) 
and that is the way i felt about it not i am not saying that that is not a possibility but 

Recording: (34/ 9621) 
yeah well like the catalogs real small and we have like five hundred thousand things and like the catalogs has know if we have not our computers are really really old like it is like an old child mainframe 

Recording: (35/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (36/ 9621) 
you tell you it is mine now 

Recording: (37/ 9621) 
oh i yeah exactly i was just wondering how can i get a job doing what you are doing 

Recording: (38/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (39/ 9621) 
or take me to court again you know they got the money i do not 

Recording: (40/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (41/ 9621) 
yes she believes all men will cheat 

Recording: (42/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (43/ 9621) 
actually i was not even that sure that i wanted to do it until um like senior year and a opportunity came up and i said oh sounds cool you know i had thought of myself as a uh chem for a long time and but then just came up here and so i mean it is just ridiculouslyly cheaper here i did not want debt under under crime this is patheticum my him is like he had posted it and he had posted it and he especially um tried to notify the national mayor people about it and i was the only one who really caught it even though the other ones like half of them wanted to go to medical school they all one of them is at printstone right now you know and they are all off of their ivy leagues like basically working their buts off to get in when i am murdered in  i do not totally understand it 

Recording: (44/ 9621) 
well it 

Recording: (45/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (46/ 9621) 
uh it is all over they contract with dominion homes and dominion is seems like it is going up everywhere in am i so they are all over uh they have projects all over 

Recording: (47/ 9621) 
she just wants to get it over with 

Recording: (48/ 9621) 
he he is in the hard to 

Recording: (49/ 9621) 
yeah it is seventy years old 

Recording: (50/ 9621) 
in their not accurate 

Recording: (51/ 9621) 
i know i i do now when it comes i do not want to touch the computer when i go home 

Recording: (52/ 9621) 
that is true 

Recording: (53/ 9621) 
oh yeah yeah and i i think i think even even if you are aware of everything that is here you still in the back of your mind you just have that it is it is joe is joe is columbus it is joe is columbus uh maybe it is because um people do not take advantage of do not realize what is actually here uh do not realize how i mean yeah it is not chicago it is not new york it is not san francisco there is a lot of places that it is not chicago it is not new york it is not there from this point there is a lot of places that it is not but it is uh you know all that oh we will never be a major league city until we have major league sports it well you know i guess uh getting out more would not that you know that would be such a small part of of civilization anywhere for me and uh i am pretty pleased with the way things are moving along and i just i i i really do think people do take advantage of it the way they should 

Recording: (54/ 9621) 
really uhhuh i think it is really good for women to learn about this we should have known about this twenty years ago all these woman i know 

Recording: (55/ 9621) 
so she is very limited on working in close corners and stuff like that uh so she is basically unable and that goes when they do that it is because your education and also they take into consideration everything 

Recording: (56/ 9621) 
which i think is kind of nice so i mean it looks like the facilities are pretty comfortable i mean my biggest thing is i just want to have a room to all to myself you know i do not want to go someplace where i would have toly deal with something else so i mean it looks it looks nice but i would be more comfortable at home i think once i got home 

Recording: (57/ 9621) 
i never learned math  we had in the fifth grade we had the principal realize that nobody knew they were times tables you know big pizza party paying for 

Recording: (58/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (59/ 9621) 
hum in person is is all on this well number one i did not realize that it was as big as it is until i started working for the career service you know i have heard people say and i know it is true that columbus is one of the top ten largest cities in the united states and i was like you are kidding me really i started driving around and i am like yeah it is  it is very huge so he says that is what he he was i mean everything within two seventy it is it is pretty darn big and um that was really surprising um i love i just love living in the big city and it is just it is just everything is so different than living in the country you mean i miss the big expenses of grass out in the country but i can ski all over the place here in town which i can not do at home i mean i could ski down our driveway but it stops and brothers and instone  so it gets real boring i mean going down hills is really fun but going back up so paying enough uh there is no more people here i i like lots of people i have discovered and i have getting lots of people around meeting all sorts of new and interesting unique people and every year and there is a whole new crowd of freshman that come in and you know it is pretty cool yepyep yep i like it an awful stay here i know i would not raise a family here but no i mean actuallyland is the perfect place to raise a family but that is about it  and i mean i do not even know how any of the actually that is actually university it is one of the it is got one of the best a bunch of these seminars in the us and it is a republican pink think pink think  it is a republican think tank so aside from the college the town is pretty much agricultural i do not know i do not know why anybody would want to live there unless they are raising a family because if they are raising a family it is a great place great community just very all around for reason family oh no i want to find i want to find someplace similar to that i wanna find someplace in colorado yeah although colorado beautiful state cousin good skiing  yeah skating skiing that is how i did this tore my ucla two years ago christmas day after christmas your it keeps it keeps your knee from moving out and doing all sorts of other miscellaneous twisting and turning positions that it is not really supposed to but i rip that right in half what i do in theimproveous well for one this place is dirty if you are from the france it is it is just so 

Recording: (60/ 9621) 
well i often have to write on papers i believe you turned in the wrong paper i believe i got the rough draft instead of the final copy do you have the final copy somewhere at home 

Recording: (61/ 9621) 
yeah ellen atlane avenue has been a big boost of my work i mean i was really lucky to run across her 

Recording: (62/ 9621) 
it does 

Recording: (63/ 9621) 
and he could not have any kind of coffee in other ways he would get the shake and he took all kinds of pills 

Recording: (64/ 9621) 
yeah so that is taking some running around 

Recording: (65/ 9621) 
um i think some of it was that i think a lot of it is that you do feel lonely um you do go through a period in your life where you do not feel like you have any friends or you feel totally different i mean i still cover to that i think we all go through that at some point or another even yearly for some of us um so i am just saying if he felt like he could go to somebody either in his family i say he using those for example or the parents paid a little bit more attention and did not have that blind eye i think that is part of your responsibility is a parent that if you see something potentially evil or wrong doing in your child is eyes you need to really admit it um i mean you do not want to do that but 

Recording: (66/ 9621) 
no no i am i am interested 

Recording: (67/ 9621) 
the lower grades we have a few middle teachers at first grade and fourth grade but not many but i think that young men young boys would do better in uh setting in school if they had a a man earlier on rather than having to wait till they are in middle school to relate to a coach and up until then it is always been a woman 

Recording: (68/ 9621) 
and this way it comes to die so 

Recording: (69/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (70/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (71/ 9621) 
you know my daughter you know there is just a lot of stuff when she was in high school and i would call up to the school and you know the principal was like he he would say you know i am i am her last chance you know my daughter was going to summer school every summer and he is like mrs you know she is like you know the average student uh she is the type you know that she is going to get you know she is got going to get through college you know she is just one of those you know that just moves right along you know she is not the is not but she that bright enough you know but she is bright enough and those are your average professional people out working today and i just like well i just want more help for my daughter you know i just want somebody to you know jerk her down 

Recording: (72/ 9621) 
well that is great 

Recording: (73/ 9621) 
you they had to and they just called me on the phone not knowing you know just that she went to the hospital well they said to me will you stay well i said yes but then uh uh when it got into two weeks and i was not getting any support from the principal or no aid or anything it is like i am sorry i am a substitute substitute i am getting sixty dollars a day i can not do this and this you know i have more help and i just flatly said that i am sorry i mean if i if it was my own job i would have strangled with it but it was not my own job and i did not know what was gonna happen so if they would have gotten some help in there for me i would have stayed perhaps but now i i you know you can work for under pay and under staff and every age you can not do everything so 

Recording: (74/ 9621) 
uh frightening or and stuff like that and uh towards all i would have to do is get us on the phone this at there and say you know i can be out there in about two hours you know so i do not wait your problem and but you need to get you to talk to me about talking to my mom about that grocery somebody else and talk to them about it 

Recording: (75/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (76/ 9621) 
and decide to go back to the jobs if you noticed the first time they voted they voted down the proposal the proposal that they are voting on this week is the exact same one 

Recording: (77/ 9621) 
and i am just used to that as an example you know i mean your other drugs i do not know much about them 

Recording: (78/ 9621) 
you could do it and my my one greata daughter uh they live in springfield they just move to springfield and she goes to kindergarten only a half day and this child is only uh five years old uh he has them reading the newspaper watching the news she told me a story about christopher columbus uh discovering america that was so deep and intense i could not believe it was coming from a five year old so this is what the teacher is doing down there 

Recording: (79/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (80/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (81/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (82/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (83/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (84/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (85/ 9621) 
no there was a lot of conflict at home uh my dad uh had to support us uh the before of us our mother has disabilities and uh she was kind of crazy 

Recording: (86/ 9621) 
i think it is probably too though that a lot of people have are not used to it i mean they are not from ohio i have found that in columbus a lot so they are kind of you know more tentative or they are from the south or something like that so they and then you run into a lot of people that are from ohio but i have noticed that a lot of people rarely do you need people born and raised in columbus so 

Recording: (87/ 9621) 
oh okay that was easy 

Recording: (88/ 9621) 
and he is real because people give him that 

Recording: (89/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (90/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (91/ 9621) 
you know so basically well yeah it might work what you means kind of stupid you know because what you are saying is we are going to take this lawn we are really going to stick you on this lawn but to hell with all the other laws so that really fair 

Recording: (92/ 9621) 
that is great 

Recording: (93/ 9621) 
oh is that right 

Recording: (94/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (95/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (96/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (97/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (98/ 9621) 
um he he is a subcontractor if uh someone is got a job to do it their house he he will do it you know like we we just went and tore the cabinets out of uh a house that was on fire and because of smoke damage 

Recording: (99/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (100/ 9621) 
all of his problems have been personal problems that really should not have been touched on the because of the media got into it and um i mean we look up to the president to be a moral man whatever but if you look at the other nations they were not that shocked that a president would do something like that 

Recording: (101/ 9621) 
yeah i do not 

Recording: (102/ 9621) 
boy that is that is a really tough one i had not even thought about that and and high school kids are so touchy about i mean about touchy about sexual identifying and and so likely you know so innoccure in their own that they are really likely to come down hard on somebody who has i say the different orientation and i i do not know i do not know 

Recording: (103/ 9621) 
i went to uh um that just about just a little uh east of here high school 

Recording: (104/ 9621) 
he works in a factory  

Recording: (105/ 9621) 
uh all this years after i left school here was the the bureau of employment services i worked with uh twenty years with uh research in statistic labor market information uh federal state programs collecting information on three different programs in that time then they worked for uh about a year and a half on a special project uh they were automating the employment services activities and they were going a complete direction to match job needs of employers and right to get more placement for interviews and this sort of thing and i developed that method uh the mechanism and the checkless and stuff i do to put it worked on that uh and then i worked for the last three years in jobs training uh for economic disadvantages to youth adults and duplicate workers 

Recording: (106/ 9621) 
and one of them they talked down to columbus was uh how well he was doing in school well children do you off have the high one of the high strawberries out rates in schools and they are not doing well so they need to be taught differently and then they cut this money so my my feeling is you know there is a lot of programs in school that sponsored by the federal government particularly uh to help the students are that are behind and they it is important 

Recording: (107/ 9621) 
when they are giving a four or five thousand dollar a year to someone who is making two hundred three hundred thousand dollars i do not care if i get five dollars that will not even buy me a tank of gas today keep the money and do something good with it 

Recording: (108/ 9621) 
that is fine my husband does but i kind of sleep between them when they are but right now i have because we early on we took our bed down and just kind of had like the bad and she was in the box spring on the floor and i have got like comforters on the side of the bed so because he is like he will like get out he is just like and i want to be in the bed with these guys and he will get on the floor and he will sleep on the comforters on the floor but he is close and he is happy that way umhum 

Recording: (109/ 9621) 
yeah it is hopefully 

Recording: (110/ 9621) 
you have a preference of five or six but by the time you turn eight one of your hemisphere is pretty much decided it is going to be the one that runs the show well then that is when those reverseals and all that back yard fives and trees and stuff usually drops out of the picture so hm 

Recording: (111/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (112/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (113/ 9621) 
i travel has been on i even for the transportation turn i travel across the state and country and before that was always traveling we took two two weeks off when we got back to the fall semester back to that and is smisters not quarters and uh uh we would get on the agree on bus but our pass was and but i would just travel over the country and sleep in the bus at night 

Recording: (114/ 9621) 
and it it is wild it just seems like the music has not gone anywhere because they keep going back to the seventy you know the rolling stones to where pink floyd or you know these are groups from back then where are these people they are supposed to have taken over for these people they are not there you know and the quality of the music just must not be there i do not know my daughter is into the brittany spars and uh uh uh uh back street boys in sing all this and now we are starting to get into some of that that is starting to get a little interest into as far as music choices and wanting to live and get them come home and i remember our car i had an eight and and you do not have to listen to it they did not have that one where our kids were oh i remember our car had an eight oh i remember our car had an eight oh i remember our car had an eight oh i do not remember our car i do not remember our car i had an eight oh i do not remember our car i do not getting paid for i do not even remember our car it had an am radio and that was it  yeah yeah on an album and now now the kids are like i want the cd put the cd in yeah yeah 

Recording: (115/ 9621) 
ah in insurance off and on working for independent insurance agents so i did that until i uh came to a company that i stayed with for seven years and then they relocated to dallas so yeah 

Recording: (116/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (117/ 9621) 
yeah and it is like no one more than the union and that is like it is such a disturbing fact to me that you could take someone is life and be like oh our bad that person was innocent you know 

Recording: (118/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (119/ 9621) 
huhuh 

Recording: (120/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (121/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (122/ 9621) 
hum 

Recording: (123/ 9621) 
and what what he he is too busy 

Recording: (124/ 9621) 
that is 

Recording: (125/ 9621) 
you know in a way and how you would have one nowadays 

Recording: (126/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (127/ 9621) 
one of the he has the most experience 

Recording: (128/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (129/ 9621) 
because you know they they bypass me and street mom mom them 

Recording: (130/ 9621) 
uh yeah my parents live in akron uh like north backer back and kind of falls area but like i said i my i had apartments down there and but like for the summer i am down here so i am a transie in always moving my stuff 

Recording: (131/ 9621) 
you know just by where you are going why do you just waste all your time running around like that 

Recording: (132/ 9621) 
so we did it it well he is always had some problems his uh his problem is saying focused on things unless it is something he is extremely interested in then you can get them away from it um if it is something he would be it is just an example in school he would sit there and he would be rolling around on the floor and stuff while they are trying to teach something in the class or it is working on a writing assignments or something a half hour to work on him he for the last five minutes the teacher said you know you really need to get that done he would sit down and write it in the fifth grade he was reading on a college level and he could do it that quickly uh i think he is lost ground on that now but and that was just an example in the second grade this guy he went to was an open classroom and uh he had been to some a couple of the traditional schools already and the principal is we told the principal talk to the principal about the problems they are having with him saying focus and she said well we can work with that what a halfway through the year she says it is not working and they have an arrangement with and i doubt if most people in the parents in the school are going to where are this with children is hospital constantly so they set a room of sight and they send counselors in once a month to work with the students it is open classroom it is experimental says people coming and going all the time and we were never aware of it i doubt if most of the people are aware of it and they met with us and then a week later they went and then served him and he was they were the teacher was telling me a story and then asking questions about it and she said he was the cancer said he was up and walking around and running around and playing with his shoes and stuff like that and she said but have came to answer questions he knew every answer she said he they they decided not to perceive at that time because this is frustrating too it was a running anniversary and my wife said now how about for a winning anniversary we just get a good report for the whole week that that was unusual and he was not a bad kid 

Recording: (133/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (134/ 9621) 
and just start picking a fight with them 

Recording: (135/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (136/ 9621)

you will you will know it is neat by the 

Recording: (138/ 9621) 
borderish country 

Recording: (139/ 9621) 
and a lot of them is been getting off the hook lately to see this guy on uh hard copy he kills this woman is husband because he is in live with her and they ended up letting him go because he was supposedly capable of making his own decisions now i think that there is there is uh things in your brain that trigger ideas and if you have a wide you know wider version of what they i do not know what they call it it is in that magazine there it is what trigger the violence and violent thought people actually do think more about the violence when they commit it than the accidental you know some of it is mindless some of it is not but everybody thinks 

Recording: (140/ 9621) 
professors yeah uh well as i mentioned a while ago i happen to have i am a one of fifteenablyings 

Recording: (141/ 9621) 
it is a great experience they really it even when you know we were having problems with them and stuff it was great uh he could not understand uh he could not understand you know my wife once said told him he says you know it is something about spending time together she she said that there is no time that we spend with you that is wasted and he could not understand that and she said you mean this is fun and so i am going to say it was fun  

Recording: (142/ 9621)

Recording: (172/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (173/ 9621)

Recording: (174/ 9621) 
because that is like me i watch the three stages and you do not see me putting a crew bar up nobody is knows 

Recording: (175/ 9621) 
right right that is the amazing thing about this country is that there is enough space in the united states and north america that you can have all these incredible past rossity developments and still be able to find relatively wild places between them yeah 

Recording: (176/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (177/ 9621) 
i come back and it you know 

Recording: (178/ 9621) 
and this the the other students are lost to the system and that is what happened with him 

Recording: (179/ 9621) 
even republicans were like that 

Recording: (180/ 9621) 
umhum yeah because i could not imagine rolling over on 

Recording: (181/ 9621) 
um i got into painting somewhat recently uh i have always done a lot of art uh my mom is an elementary school art teacher so i was always exposed to art as a child uh and did pretty good too by never gone to painting it was mainly drawing that kind of thing and just uh three or four years ago i thought i am going to learn how to paint and i learned to out of paint 

Recording: (182/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (183/ 9621) 
yeah i have read that i need to try that just for winter even 

Recording: (184/ 9621) 
oh yeah that was a that was a job helping them to move 

Recording: (185/ 9621) 
oh yeah under certain 

Recording: (186/ 9621) 
no no but that but that is what i am saying but that that is what i am saying the same thing is happening when we had a budgeting we took kids out of the poor environment and put them in a nice environment oh they they got the taste of it and then they went back home oh they um and we did an in a very unjustice thing to those kids into the families and then when they broke them up we just something else you know taken our in to be a lots of community involvement so now the parents can not follow our activities uh getting something up hey we do not want them we do not want our families that is a misnoneor they said the the community raises the family the kids yeah that is how they want you to think but the the community will not be able to replace the family 

Recording: (187/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (188/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (189/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (190/ 9621) 
yeah see i hate that like all the work that you do is like reduced like one leather 

Recording: (191/ 9621) 
well and 

Recording: (192/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (193/ 9621) 
the way i feel 

Recording: (194/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (195/ 9621) 
right after high school i think there was probably i will say six and amazingly ah well three were still together 

Recording: (196/ 9621) 
are not they but they all look alike 

Recording: (197/ 9621) 
no no but 

Recording: (198/ 9621) 
china we just had a van who took time to 

Recording: (199/ 9621) 
oh okay 

Recording: (200/ 9621) 
um wow that is nice yeah i am sure 

Recording: (201/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (202/ 9621) 
that is true 

Recording: (203/ 9621) 
uh they uh stopped federal way funding uh was you that was the federal control power and they contracted it out so you either lost your job and stayed there and worked for the contractor or you picked up and moved on and you know some people move like to arizona and california and and i thought well since i have like two and a half years until i retire and i really like columbus and i thought i do not want to up root my daughter is out of school and and leave and start over so that is why i will just go to poor columbus and suffer it out until i can 

Recording: (204/ 9621) 
so i guess you i mean that one well that was really really hard for me i will just call all my family members i had family members coming over to try to figure out what this child needed but i do not know i could not tell you what he went through with that crime spell but he did go to that where he just then got quick crime 

Recording: (205/ 9621) 
i try to be as much as possible to i think it is very important that both parents they see both 

Recording: (206/ 9621) 
the very fair area from the south east london 

Recording: (207/ 9621) 
city council of dayton and had highlighted a whole bunch of it and hoping that uh they would do something along that line instead of going to climus at the same time or interesting 

Recording: (208/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (209/ 9621) 
yeah and i really think both of them will be good parents someday but she says we are not ready 

Recording: (210/ 9621) 
my dad seems to think i should go into law because there is law and everything you can do anything with a law degree 

Recording: (211/ 9621) 
well personally i voted that the thirty three should pass i think they should the way i an understood i they have ways of reading those things you can not to read very currently and they will whether you should say yes or no one thing i said just because i uh analyze it to say that they are repealing something that was passed i think one or two years ago that was allowing things to be done up around the poor area like new roads and this and that and i want that repe because i do not think we should be helping anybody else to do that and taking the money away from the other thing 

Recording: (212/ 9621) 
oh my god 

Recording: (213/ 9621) 
they are just like it a little less or just like it a little more when when it it looks like it is gonna come to something it looks like they are it feels like they are trying to tease me as an audience and i i that is not something i feel teased by particularly 

Recording: (214/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (215/ 9621) 
kind 

Recording: (216/ 9621) 
been even think about asking 

Recording: (217/ 9621) 
yeah i i saw it in the beginning i missed mary lake cafe so bad it is uh the good subs and all that i do not i do not know why i missed them i do not i go back and i just do not like it any more 

Recording: (218/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (219/ 9621) 
whenever he runs well i thought he was going to be elected uh mayor too but he did not there but i do not know what that was about but uh uh you know he is got his constituents and they are going to reelect him because he stands up for the minority i think he well he makes a mistake of the labeled things races that are not necessarily races but anyway 

Recording: (220/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (221/ 9621) 
yeah just like uh having alcohol around i mean gambling is a lot like alcohol can be addicted it could screw your life up and you will spend your last dollar on it if you are that far gone so pretty much anything can be one of those factors  

Recording: (222/ 9621) 
um i would agree that i think regardless of your race you should be able to adopt child i mean just because your black kid living with like a white family does not mean you can not still have your heritage or whatever to be proud of i mean at the same thing with like irish people adopting like italian babies or something like that i mean it is no different i mean as long as basically you know your roots and where you came from i mean i can not see it being a problem of any sorts um i mean just as long as they have someone that care is for the kid and does this stuff for them i mean i can not see them being any 

Recording: (223/ 9621) 
i personally agree with that but that is just from my own moral belief and everything but i do not know i i do not think that there is one solution that will fit every every child in every situation i mean my husband had his daughter when he was seventeen so you know obviously his and he said his dad told him about kind of them you know so they are going to make that decision on their own i would say just and and plus with internet and everything they they have access to so much information i i think that it falls back on the parents still if you are going to be a parent you need to be responsible and i do not think that it is getting done 

Recording: (224/ 9621) 
i know 

Recording: (225/ 9621) 
um in general i think i think the united states has fairly well developed like class not like class structured in which you can not move up or down but like we have a a fairly large middle class 

Recording: (226/ 9621) 
yeah uh 

Recording: (227/ 9621) 
 lower that is right  you have been to a thrill yeah  yeah 

Recording: (228/ 9621)

Recording: (249/ 9621) 
i i do not think so in new york it might be i am like i say it is a lot more competitive there here i think i think columbus is in the midwest in general i think is much more open 

Recording: (250/ 9621) 
yeah there is uh some people that just get lazy then you have got the college students they i do not know how many of them work but most of them there is just from out of town

i ever thought he was any better than anybody else you know was always there to to help out if he could you know but then some people like you say you know some people are not that way 

Recording: (254/ 9621) 
oh yeah they were more settled 

Recording: (255/ 9621) 
yeah yeah they are pretty good where i live uh last year when we had that really really high snow um i shoveled in then like an hour later it blew over so it was like but so  um but our neighborhood has a lot of children so most of the people do shovel their sidewalk

Recording: (259/ 9621) 
so i am not going to get any fairnessness or justice out of that but uh so they sent me they are worth saying that they started in their favor and all that crap well you know fine uh but i am not going to i am not going to pay them till they contact me again 

Recording: (260/ 9621) 
it is funny because i had studied russian but a lot of the people i have served with were clint and spanish or something else so it is like i do not know why they got sent there but it is uh i mean we have really believe that they are that it is inspired they send are your name and it picksure in your application to the profit who is the head of the church and um they pray over it and they decide where you go 

Recording: (261/ 9621) 
yeah right yeah we could put a little trailer there we would be outside most of the time anyway so  

Recording: (262/ 9621) 
i do not know matter what they are 

Recording: (263/ 9621) 
uh it is not really in office he is like a uh supervisor that just goes to the different job sites he he tells the the crew members what houses to work on and which ones are ready and and then he gets to uh talk with the the other contractor and he works together with them but he is really just there is a main place where they park all their trucks and then he just goes to the different site 

Recording: (264/ 9621) 
i do not know she is getting a second child now and it is getting a little harder 

Recording: (265/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (266/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (267/ 9621) 
i just hope he stays around i i i do not know maybe not but i grew up with all his father and i really um have that against my father because he lives around us he never caught us you know and and i really got resentment against him 

Recording: (268/ 9621) 
yeah you you can not have a beer gun in a big ass and it means you are it means you are sloppy and lazy if you do but if the man does it is like oh god he is probably got some power behind him and it is like uh he is probably just as lazy as anybody else it is like you know i you know i hate to see girls starve themselves to death you know it is like uh you know there are certain times of your life where you are going to be fat you know you know my my youngest daughter has a problem with that you know she is i do not know why she is so unstable because she out of the four of us including her sister is like you know right at the top i mean she has done television she is done radio voiceover is she is been in plays and she was in a high school play when she was a uh uh kindergarten student and actually had speaking part and i am sitting down in the audience like in her is because and i i am like why am i crying but it is like you know how can she do this and you know like you see her on i saw her on a few tv commercials and i am like i tried to do that and if you can picture driving along the highway at night with your bright lights on and the deer doing this that is about how good i am in those and she is just like you know and she she is not a smart at i mean she does not show off but she is just so relaxed doing this and it is it looks so natural but she does not see that because you know you know she always thinks she is very uh mediocre and i go but you know i said you know you have been in front of television cameras and you do so well i said you get on the radio you do well i said you do well in school you have a ton of friends i said yeah i have a great body i said you know i said i never compare the two of them but they are sometimes when i have have to i said look at your sister she has the same chest i do i said you definitely are well built there i said you have a nice shape i said when you have a bathing suit on it is like i go somebody put a child on her and on i said you know you just do not realize all the physical and and also the character contributesutes you have i said you have a great person and i said you go in a room of a hundred people with me and your sister and about three days later somebody will go john and july and they will just go oh but in ten minutes they will go where is did you know that because they all know you you are just so easy to get along with and everybody likes you and they said you just do not realize this gigantic list of character physical and mental trades you have that i can never even come close to habit 

Recording: (269/ 9621) 
you know that is not because i am still doing things because when i was a kid my dad was crippled my head to fix everything so 

Recording: (270/ 9621) 
but um and he is limited his meat a little bit more but with men it is a lot harder i think you know when there is used to used to meat and potato kind of families um but like thanksgiving it just does not mean that much to me i the family thing goes but you know the turkey  we i do not cook it very often my sister we usually get my sisters 

Recording: (271/ 9621) 
you are like oh i can not pay  you can go down the  you know for a cat  you know it is just the cat  you know it is funny  you can go down and visit it any time have a you know uh  oh right  

Recording: (272/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (273/ 9621) 
yeah there are there are times when you know just there is a uh group over there called star trek 

Recording: (274/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (275/ 9621) 
would you do uh oh god you know i feel like uh i was a parent before i was a parent you know and i that is the way it felt it was like some of my friends like looked this guy he is hand with he he is a run into lockers in high school like that is so good 

Recording: (276/ 9621) 
and that type of person i do not think could make a very effective president because i do not know president needs to be able to think fast on their feet 

Recording: (277/ 9621) 
uh it is a pretty pretty it is it and uh you know enough around there to it is a it is a classic school up on the west side 

Recording: (278/ 9621) 
yeah i somebody is got to get get you know put george bush to the back 

Recording: (279/ 9621) 
 yeah that is 

Recording: (280/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (281/ 9621) 
um i i think it fills it is niche you know i mean i mean wax and rs and the museum has an inch and um i think it fills it very well 

Recording: (282/ 9621) 
that so that if you if you whoever won you know we would get but we just went on field trips and had a great time  it might be better now 

Recording: (283/ 9621) 
he is going to he is going to be there all summer yeah i did not decide i wanted to change it over until i got my scaner um and found out that when i checked the web site for the scaner that they are just simply flat out not making one of those two thousand drivers from i standard so it is a um crap i do not know i just got it and i can not even remember what it is um paperport i think it is paperport of the way the window is thousand that all costs stick with ninety eight much better much better operating system  

Recording: (284/ 9621) 
you do not go into elementary ed that much 

Recording: (285/ 9621) 
well i i enjoy it  but it it will be impersonal uh because here you are i am not camped face you i do not know whether you are really getting me in what you talking about by all this sitting there in that in that uh street if they or not but i really do think we are going to be disconnected in that sense and and it becomes you so much more imperson imperson i guess i am very strong about the putterner personal versus impersonal or any communications uhand the bad that we have talked about i think will be a part of that ten and twenty years from now but i think we will have they gone by that time to try to clean up the act if you will uh going back to the political question i think the financial question i think the financial things that i think we will start we will start slowing that down i think we will have less influence in in terms of thewow i do not think we will get back to abram lincoln days but uh if we could swing our opinion on back uh i think we i think we can i think we will i think we could do the same thing with communications uh i i think we can eliminate a lot of the uh bad bad influences i do know that over time what we would have called bad back here is not necessarily bad here it is sort of like the definition of need versus luxury uh there is definitely a change the definition of socialism democracy they certainly have changed over these times well the same thing will true be true with those it still function  excuse me um and i think we were also slowly swing our attention on back to the back to the and to the family again there are those boom sayers from up ony or saying that uh in in many years it comes there will not be such a thing as a family uh it is just you you go out here you need a an opposite tax pro create and you go on your way she goes on her way and she is just satisfied about going her way as you are going your way um it yes a lot of that is true but i think that uh i think that i do not think that is going to ever happen i think we will turn that thing around i think this so cold divorce rate program as i talked about a while ago i uh every or fifty percent of people who marry within five years are no longer together i think that will will change and that is a very significant thing i think in terms of getting back to the basic family 

Recording: (286/ 9621) 
i feel like i should be standing out there giving money because my bills are getting behind 

Recording: (287/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (288/ 9621) 
i am not sure i am ready to go back through all that 

Recording: (289/ 9621) 
abent for the whole day which would be considered church so they said i what i had to do was go down to juvenile to this certain gentleman in juvenile and have him file churches so i took my son down to ham and he said it was a school should have did that so in the meantime he is telling me that my son is getting ready to go to the eleventh grade and neither side is gonna do anything about it somebody should have did something about that because then you know they would have been doing what they were supposed to do to make him you know get in line and uh so you knew that he could get by with it 

Recording: (290/ 9621) 
and the fact that i recognized all that and could not wait to get out of there and when i was gone i was gone and and even now we still have this ongoing thing where my in fact i have been real happy about them lately because um i have we have lived in our same house for twenty years and my parents they they live in florida they um i mean they are not well to do by any means but they they are not liking for anything and they could afford to take plane trips and they could afford to go to california twice a year to they spend a week with my brother et cetera et cetera and they come here a couple times a year and they stay at my sister is house they have only come to my home three times in twenty years and it is because they do not want to get off the freeway they will drive through columbus from florida to go to visit people in in in in in they stay in cincinnati and they stay in spring so with my sisters and they will not do it because it is just too they do not want to have to deal with that traffic they do not like that and it and just recently i have finally said you know i do not understand why you can not do that you know i have actually called them up i am fifty two 

Recording: (291/ 9621) 
i would say there would be certain life application things that all kids should know but not i do not will think that you can say everything you know you have everybody has to do this because you know people are individuals and you have to take that into consideration i think so 

Recording: (292/ 9621) 
i know 

Recording: (293/ 9621) 
yeah it was  

Recording: (294/ 9621) 
well i really think that is happening right now because i think that i do not know what the divorce statistics have been recently but i do see that more people who are getting married are staying married because those that do not those that would have gotten the divorce they are not bothering to get married to begin with they are just living together and then they separate so what and i think that 

Recording: (295/ 9621) 
um i talk to them every now and then 

Recording: (296/ 9621) 
you know white napkins and you know we would go there for lunch you know you would dress nice and uh you know i i like that and i would uh like you know my grandkids to be able to go downtown with me like that you know rather than have to drive off to a mall 

Recording: (297/ 9621) 
yeah that part was no different i mean 

Recording: (298/ 9621) 
they had a two by four on the door for over a month 

Recording: (299/ 9621) 
no that that go over the wall here would not it 

Recording: (300/ 9621) 
so they call 

Recording: (301/ 9621) 
i mean he would have he would have been in the money then because he is just starting his business down there and uh while while i was down there he had me sleeping in a truck a moving truck and uh all me it is it is a hilarious story i mean thirty foot moving truck i am sleeping in it and i get uh 

Recording: (302/ 9621) 
now who does he work for 

Recording: (303/ 9621) 
and some of that is controlled with medication now but not all of it because they because of the drug and alcohol they will not put him on some of the medication so but as far as i can tell he is been pretty clear and clean on that and uh you know once she got pregnant they both stopped smoking she is taking very good care of herself she uh she lately has been going with him to psychology and uh uh we have been paying for it but we do not have a problem with that because he is going  he likes the psychologist so took a long time to get to that point but uh so we have been talking to the psychologist about it they said she he said most people that are raised in that background he said they go different ways once once they they fall into the same uh patternist appearance or they are surviving she appears to be a surviving uh she is never really had what i would call a normal family or at least she she likes to spend time with us uh which i am glad uh and she we really like her she is really we enjoy being with her but sometimes me more than being with my son uh 

Recording: (304/ 9621) 
so i i try to gear what he watches towards educational programming instead of just junk  

Recording: (305/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (306/ 9621) 
and just took it and ripped it 

Recording: (307/ 9621) 
i know it is possible but i can not imagine it would they not knowing how big it is going to get i guess i can not imagine 

Recording: (308/ 9621) 
 i do not know i am going to get shot 

Recording: (309/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (310/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (311/ 9621) 
it is like down to hill kind of by the horse yeah so that is where we go and i do not have any student ideas i just sneak them but it is the summer they do not even care they never 

Recording: (312/ 9621) 
i think i think they should um i think a lot of the fear of this material comes uh from people who hold the belief that that you choose your but that you can be converted to homosexual i personally do not believe that so it i you know i am not afraid of it but i can see how people would hold the opposite view and that i that is where this comes comes from but since i think they are wrong  i think it should be my way and i think i think you know i think the material should be there i think it you know dealt with in a common reasonable way and i think it should be accessible to the kids 

Recording: (313/ 9621) 
yeah yeah i heard something about that 

Recording: (314/ 9621) 
i retired about uh four years ago from this state and i worked there for thirty years actually i started working for the state only in school here i worked here and that counted this five years kind of towards retirement so i was able to retire early and then uh last uh about the last two and a half years i have been working at the symphony and then the boss is office started part time and then i was full time for a while and then i request they cut back to parttime again because uh 

Recording: (315/ 9621) 
i am i am going to keep doing the same stuff you know i will find some other kids somewhere else and i will have some time you know my husband and i have time together and i i always find some i always have a project you know it is like i am always saying well when things slow down around here i am going to like right now i should be home counting money for the i i did a fund raiser for the the school and we raised um we just sell up morally candy and racking paper and all that kind of stuff and our sales are where from twenty five thousand to forty thousand dollars then so we get half of that for the profit and i do that to myself but that also means that i have thousand thousand dollars to sort of their own exercise so but anyhow but it would be on the slow down but then i always will find another project so and i rehab house houses whenever i get a chance i like to do that so 

Recording: (316/ 9621) 
hum 

Recording: (317/ 9621) 
humum 

Recording: (318/ 9621) 
okay does is it like a less that kind of spanish oh are they uh 

Recording: (319/ 9621) 
i i roll a uh big fan uh i think one of the big problems is going to be uh uh initially just the uh uh the monitor thing of it you know the people that supported the uh basically supported the uh uh minor league team that they had here you know like blue collar people that that could go for twenty thirty bucks and have a good time get drunk of beer and and up very you know going to be able to do that it is going to cost you uh and then it was fifty to a hundred dollars probably to take her to the same way a couple of kids or something like that you know 

Recording: (320/ 9621) 
or anything like that i mean that is something that i do not know i would sort of make known to them but not something that i would really push on them 

Recording: (321/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (322/ 9621) 
actually i that is what got me interested in so i went to library school and 

Recording: (323/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (324/ 9621) 
yeah he likes he loves some chicken and he loves chicken that is like his favorite food but 

Recording: (325/ 9621) 
and i have been on both worlds  

Recording: (326/ 9621) 
it would not publicize to the the degree that it is now it seems like anymore or nothing you the second i mean as far as the papers are concerned and uh uh something else and i i guess i am olded fashion but i do not think we need all this publicity about all the sexualist if aids of all the people that are motorright or have yesot aous lives uhuh they just uh i would say maybe i am old enough though i can hardly perceive anyone being a genuinely homosexual i mean evidently they are but uh it is still against human nature i think or against conventional human nature anyway 

Recording: (327/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (328/ 9621) 
she helped a lot 

Recording: (329/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (330/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (331/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (332/ 9621) 
it is regular is enough for me in that and i did not have i can schedule the owners 

Recording: (333/ 9621) 
we took um or i took a military ethnic as a philosophy of course and that was really interesting because even though in even in that high a arch they are still certain contacts within the contact of war for instance if if we both know if we knowing they go into it as combat is and we are fighting for whatever college but if we both are really going into it 

Recording: (334/ 9621) 
no every once in a while with my grandmother she always wanted me to become a nurse and i was a senior in high school and she died in sometimes i think boy she really liked it then i was a nurse because i still use her blood pressure cup and everything she had given me her blood pressure cup i mean that is very old 

Recording: (335/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (336/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (337/ 9621) 
yeah my grandmother is from ireland my grandmother and grandfather are both from ireland 

Recording: (338/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (339/ 9621) 
yeah but i mean you know a kid that you know might wanna save up for something when he is twelve years old has no chance at all getting the job 

Recording: (340/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (341/ 9621) 
well that is the other thing they are a lot of times they are good in the arts they are either an artist i have a boy right now that is an age grader that is painting a huge canvas for me for my living room because i have not been able to find a picture so i brought in the picture and he is in largeing it and painting it for me in his free time and it is going to go in my living room and i mean it is it is i mean he is really quite the artist and music arts um literature acting i have had kids that have been like really top notch actors in the school plays it it is just not necessarily a school kind of thing that they are going to be good at but i try to explain to the parents that just because your child learns differently is no reason to think they will not be successful in life mark spitz one of them lping gold metal has a learning disability share bow can not remember a phone number without transportation two of the numbers she says that herself um sondstein did not learn to read till he was twelve um winston churchill he studied until he was like seven or eight uh while disney was told by a manager at world war is that he would never have a creative idea in his life 

Recording: (342/ 9621) 
hm 

Recording: (343/ 9621) 
um i it i think it depends on the child and i think it depends on the adult as far as the supervision of it you know we are very strict as far as what games they have you know it is so wild you know when we were kids cowboy in indians everybody had guns everybody you know if you had the best death act you were the best you know and now just go home do not let him have a gun you know do not let him play with you know even a squirt gun you know and so you wonder whether it is over little or you none of us grew up shooting people or this you know we do not own in fire our up and we played with guns and played him out in all these games and so i just wonder whether this is really you know but society is a lot different now 

Recording: (344/ 9621) 
yeah they are going to most likely raise it up to twenty one since all these uh the kentucky and maryland colorado all their school shootings and can not believe in i mean there is articles in there you would not even believe if you have not read them 

Recording: (345/ 9621) 
most my friends 

Recording: (346/ 9621) 
umhum and they should very rarely deductor even ask about allergies and i more and more and people do not even realize that they get sick so often they need to ask about allergies or even just have a little minor test that they can take when people when they can not figure out which wrong with them because a lot of times it is a allergic reaction to the things they have eaten 

Recording: (347/ 9621) 
so like uh there is like a there a large american population say well i think i want to just you know like you know yeah you it is like cause this to follow this but sometimes you know well it just want to hang out what do you get with your own so is you know do you have it is there any probably it is just funny you know people from the states 

Recording: (348/ 9621) 
there are a lot of roommates that we are cutting that much weight if not more they were pretty much doing it for the team 

Recording: (349/ 9621) 
yeah frankly it can kind of usually votes differently than the rest of at least the metropolitan areas of the state 

Recording: (350/ 9621) 
so i started working i was fourteen i have been working ever since i have been out of school since i was sixteen so i was in the service i was in vietnam 

Recording: (351/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (352/ 9621) 
yeah yeah and i do computer processing mostly what you know i i work from ten at night until eight in the morning so 

Recording: (353/ 9621) 
just really starting to get started and i mean somebody you would not even be that is enough you know you want somebody who has computer skills as well that is 

Recording: (354/ 9621) 
yeah but i have i have never voted in the primary my son said that uh i need to but i am not real interested in boating in the primary 

Recording: (355/ 9621) 
and then there is the one that is like how much i had doing so i have at christmas well i used to work at hurting hospital as a teacher when um i first went to worthinton when i said i got another job i got a job working in hearting hospital as the as a principal but i was also a teacher so i taught part of the day and i was also the administrator because they had a small school there for the kids that were in the adalaskin unit and they were away from home and they had to go to school and get their credit somewhere so the doctors always used to we were on the like each person would be on a team of these kids would be assigned to these kids and you would go to your team meetings and the doctors the strength would go well i mean i got t weeks off at christmas you know they would be itioning about the back of the that that we got time off and they did not and i finally came up with the perfect thing one time i said well doctor simpson or whatever his name was doctor brown you know how it is some of us went for the big bucks and some of us went for the time off 

Recording: (356/ 9621) 
um aids being one of them 

Recording: (357/ 9621) 
the rest of the october okay i have now dover and a fairy one i was doing into a number 

Recording: (358/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (359/ 9621) 
so that is mainly it is probably more for fishing 

Recording: (360/ 9621) 
do i think they will oh yes i think they definitely will i think there is so much heavy uh political and financial well i am a reverse that statement uh there is so much heavy financial influence upon the political uh influence that it it is almost a four gone conclusion and if it does not occur this within this year and uh there may be another vote in another year or in the in the next election but i think that in fact it will go 

Recording: (361/ 9621) 
some times she in mary had more disagreements than i have read with her 

Recording: (362/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (363/ 9621) 
well the humans is started it and the man narrowating the thing said there was not a single animal that they profileed in the thing that uh um behaved the way it did on its own accord 

Recording: (364/ 9621) 
yeah i think it does course we were fiddling with that so much and  

Recording: (365/ 9621) 
no i do not want them to get together i love the attention they get together at the bed whenever they get like any of their like five or six amples where it looks like they are going to hook out and you know that one where there was like uh a a the duplicateicate molder 

Recording: (366/ 9621) 
um actually i think it needs to probably start younger than that 

Recording: (367/ 9621) 
well i see growing up we did not have we it was not really called sex ed um they talked about the female a productive system nothing about men which is kind of funny you know it was always the women in that sharp you know 

Recording: (368/ 9621) 
she said you know what they say now and i would read me hand and put six she said four 

Recording: (369/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (370/ 9621) 
he makes me angry to people like that even get money 

Recording: (371/ 9621) 
wow 

Recording: (372/ 9621) 
definitely 

Recording: (373/ 9621) 
so i was shut out on the job market then huh that did not bother me i thought well i do not mind i went that is the one i got the job channel four but uh it is like anything else on some blacks use it for good some blacks use it for bad 

Recording: (374/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (375/ 9621) 
so that is just the means i get to hear more of my book 

Recording: (376/ 9621) 
i know the same cake at mine would have been like seven dollars or something like that and you know but uh you know i am i do not try to be that that cheaply i mean i will not go without health plan or anything like that but you know they are certainly like my car i love cars and you know you take the car to car washington it is like seven fifty or eight bucks and you watch it of driveway and it is about a quarter you know it is like it takes time if you if you have no time and you know that i i have friends at work that their the mom is a taxi cab driveer and the dad is the worker bean and when they get home they do not want to do anything so they pay to the yard down they do this and other that and it is like they have then they always go we have no money and it is like because you pay to do everything you know slow your life down a little bit you know it is like you making your soup you know when if and when you have children when they get my age they are going to go i can remember walking around the house and going mom is making bean soup for mom is making vegetable soup or mom baked the cake it is like as opposed to opening up oh here is a mar cake you know 

Recording: (377/ 9621) 
that is all right yeah 

Recording: (378/ 9621) 
and they are more hyper about like you know bad thing for people to do you know that the during game the smoking there is not as strict about it basically 

Recording: (379/ 9621) 
kind of like they say i do not i do not believe that homosexuality is taught uh i think the kid will grow up in this girl or grow old and be just fine 

Recording: (380/ 9621) 
uh where we put all kinds of information out on our own web site which is very hard to find what you want you know that is a constant problem with information is the more you put out there the harder it is to find what you want but if you can not get to it if it is not out there you can not find it uh it it is a problem for us to for library because there is just a barage of what they are getting and it is not just for us it is from the literature uh there is literally you know hundreds of library publications uh and it is a problem the librarianians are facing all the time they can not keep up 

Recording: (381/ 9621) 
uh i was raised your most of my life 

Recording: (382/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (383/ 9621) 
i 

Recording: (384/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (385/ 9621) 
so uh they got us kids actually and time but they did not i mean they 

Recording: (386/ 9621) 
oh and this is about you got it over three years 

Recording: (387/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (388/ 9621) 
the other one just they did not really well 

Recording: (389/ 9621) 
a little bit yeah 

Recording: (390/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (391/ 9621) 
that is perfect 

Recording: (392/ 9621) 
they uh what they 

Recording: (393/ 9621) 
no i have not been paying a lot of attention to it just because i do not know 

Recording: (394/ 9621) 
so i am very embarrassedous i am so sorry and the guy is like uh nobody else is eaten this you might as  

Recording: (395/ 9621) 
which was now you see what those guns all are they figured within ten ten yards was ahead was a talk and because if you had one of those things thirty seven pounds of tin teag off of the i am tin yard so i  

Recording: (396/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (397/ 9621) 
and the way he was writing right now he is really interested in eastern religions i am not sure where that came from you know when they go to college and they are gone you do not see him much uh that is what he is interested in right now so i do not think it it it it really took 

Recording: (398/ 9621) 
well he told a jewish friend of mine that her grandparents that died in the holy cost went to hell because they were jewish 

Recording: (399/ 9621) 
is that right 

Recording: (400/ 9621) 
because i have seen more violence on our car seeing more women beat i have seeing more kids beat i have seen more drunk in driving racks 

Recording: (401/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (402/ 9621) 
and their needs were immediate 

Recording: (403/ 9621) 
it so i just see a pattern you know and i just feel like this is going to happen to me eventually 

Recording: (404/ 9621) 
i was going to say i i have seen situations too where i can see their side of it as well because the mothers are used to or the wives are used to be in home and the husband support him and in those situations they still want them to they still do not want to go out there and do that and uh in you know they need to look at each one of those cases too because i know there is alimonyy and all that kind of thing and that can be if you can never go out and have another life or have it on their wife and you know 

Recording: (405/ 9621) 
oh really where are you from 

Recording: (406/ 9621) 
because um i think the fact that things like at responsibility maybe a long time ago people stayed married because they felt like they had a responsibility to take care of of their family i mean and you can be divorced and still take care of your family instead of uh you know things as far as people getting paid and then and then this person goes off and and we have just it is more especially acceptable to to be able to do anything now than they think it was or in time ago i mean people is families would would never stand for something like that they would say look you need to take care of this you need to deal with this and now it is just it is kind of horrible and everybody just kind of goes along with it 

Recording: (407/ 9621) 
 el all the kids in the world all that that will happen do that that influence all the kids 

Recording: (408/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (409/ 9621) 
right  

Recording: (410/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (411/ 9621) 
umhum yeah see they are going to be fine to house we want our we will go build it some way 

Recording: (412/ 9621) 
yeah i think they do 

Recording: (413/ 9621) 
not that not that i have seen you know 

Recording: (414/ 9621) 
oh the charge was cutting class yeah and where it was i was supposed to meet my mom outside i told my teacher i brought another guy skis slip and all that i went down to my locker before and the teacher we caught her the general because she would always be out there watching me not a teacher but administrator excuse me and she was out there and she was telling me my locker and what are you doing down here in the whole thirty minute conversation that could have only lasted five minutes with ankey okay here is my slip she thought i forged this slip 

Recording: (415/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (416/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (417/ 9621) 
i am an independent 

Recording: (418/ 9621) 
um in in trying to stop it uh i am trying to think of some good examples i mean when politicians start talking about like biological functions 

Recording: (419/ 9621) 
yeah it is a tour it is a package tour uh you know from the wrong floorin so it then it is these uh you know see does not interest me 

Recording: (420/ 9621) 
exactly yeah 

Recording: (421/ 9621) 
it was a law enforcement career and i mean 

Recording: (422/ 9621) 
oh it is sort of like the sociology of like quicks you know like how how that develops like how people like some people seek to like fit in like you know like 

Recording: (423/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (424/ 9621) 
and how are you and i know like one point in time it is like we do not want to hang out with you crystal i am like we will find out i do not care i will go hang out with them and it is like they they still need to do a lot of growing up 

Recording: (425/ 9621) 
uh yeah they uh near near west side is always been a pretty bad area now from the last forty or fifty years and it is starting to creep with 

Recording: (426/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (427/ 9621) 
yeah that is true we went oh and they have got a nice facility i mean they have a a uh like a labor in the labor room that is got like it is weird though because when you go they show you they they talk about all this world pulled back thing a room is i do not know if you have heard of those commercials or not but they there is only one room that is like that 

Recording: (428/ 9621) 
and that is really an important issue right now i i i saw that the first time in nineteen ninety two because i uh i have not said it yet but you know anyone who is listening to this paper you would be able to know i am a democrat and generally vote democratic although i will tell you i i did vote for grip regular uh and if he had run again i would have voted for him because i like his style and he has not been bad for the city but uh i am generally a democrat uh and i have only voted for two people who won the presidential election and i knew in ninety two early on that clinton was going to win just by being out with people and i was at a restaurant one time with my girlfriend and a waiter came up and uh he said something about you know and i can not remember how we got started on the topic you know just taking my my order for restaurant but he said something about um uh dole was too old and this is a young guy he was in college and i knew there was there was a a sort of a shift people wanted someone with younger ideas and uh a new vision they did not want the world war two vision anymore uh and i thought that was was kind of interesting because by and large most young people also supported reagan and i thought do they really understand difference in different in what the two stand for but it was that reagan appears young and care of somebody and so did clinton so i think for the average voter that does have uh a lot of sway 

Recording: (429/ 9621) 
oh the vegetables in the summer that they have downtown i mean those are these are really great and they are you know i mean they are they are crowded but they are peaceful you know there is not there is not rioting in the streets and there is a lot to do and great you know great music 

Recording: (430/ 9621) 
really and it is a fun job but really is i i have only ever known one male that taught first grade uh new one guy that taught third most of the time if they go into elementary ed they go for the upper grades like four or five or six but um i really think that if we let the boys be more exposed to men earlier than they would be more motivated to learn because they would see that it is not just a girly thing they would say oh well mister son so things that is important that i know this and he is a real macho guide so i better learn it you know i do i really do nowadays with the pay being better we are getting more men but 

Recording: (431/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (432/ 9621) 
exactly 

Recording: (433/ 9621) 
well of course by going to be working the government she would have 

Recording: (434/ 9621)

Recording: (447/ 9621)

Recording: (449/ 9621) 
doing the dumping down of schools 

Recording: (450/ 9621)

Recording: (451/ 9621) 
did not get back to the him they did not even had time and he was just covered with those sores where i do not know how long uh mom said that after they started after the scabs started falling off them boy he would get out of the bed and he would take the sheet out in the yard and shake it to get them scabs so but uh 

Recording: (452/ 9621) 
to be close so i did not have to drive  

Recording: (453/ 9621) 
now you will hear me wait too much 

Recording: (454/ 9621) 
well that is what that is what they have done you know they have done that here too they have done it every university 

Recording: (455/ 9621) 
uh and that that is a problem in our society if if something can come out of the university here to promote the reverse of that i think you have a lot less psychological problems of people and domestic problems work problems everything because the problem comes down to the fact well gee it is not it is not recognized you know we are whatever these um trends in our society said well you got to be a you have got to be a computer good old you have got to be this well before it beforegates was recognized he was nothing 

Recording: (456/ 9621) 
with my mother umhum 

Recording: (457/ 9621) 
oh yeah yeah you work really hard while you are at it and then when you done you are done 

Recording: (458/ 9621) 
i would think it would be cheaper organic food 

Recording: (459/ 9621) 
no my husband yeah he is he is from she can wear a bandone of them but that is it  and i you know i would love to do that with her only on things like that i would not be the type that would put a sped around her on tuesday and a little skirt on around wednesday but i i would get a kick out of that um she 

Recording: (460/ 9621) 
and i did not do that myself but we had a couple of boys in the outfiel who could uh find where we were on a map and where our hope or observation putt putt was and where the enemy out here was and all that and uh it is uh it really is it was interesting uh calculation trying to calculate where yourself is run land out there 

Recording: (461/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (462/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (463/ 9621) 
different 

Recording: (464/ 9621) 
the bonning 

Recording: (465/ 9621) 
course i am going to get stopped for suspicious person everywhere i go 

Recording: (466/ 9621) 
leaving out stuff man  

Recording: (467/ 9621) 
 pizza 

Recording: (468/ 9621) 
i mean i do not think they should get rid of it for a poor thing  but you know there is plenty of them all to go to the house that is okay  it is not a big deal to me to tell you the truth no actually i live i live close to i live east of the more 

Recording: (469/ 9621) 
is not that right  you know i just i just love them and i i just love those quality of food  just to see if while ago i would go  you know they just like little tiny here just bring them bring them to your dog and say he is he is a little play maybe he he is a he is a bit he is a baby running for you  really did they you know well he looks so sweet and cutly you know it is like looks like something that you guys would not take homeboy they eat 

Recording: (470/ 9621) 
well my son started yeah son started in public school for kindergarten and he just my son is my son is a very social child will say he is the one that talks too much  it is a teacher say he is a social child he talks too much he likes to get up and run around and he needs something very structured i mean he needs to kind of run around but he needs something very structured you getting near a bunch of other kids when he was little and it was like he would just run and scream at them because he was ready to play well yeah and yeah my and my daughter my daughter is the opposite of that uh but he would do that and so he was not he was very front he was not learning things and he was constantly getting in trouble and it is like i i do not know we would be told he was a problem but he did not understand what was going on and he was there was not a structured he would go to school every day and they would not know what to expect because there was not like this we will do this and then we will do this and we will do this so he checked out the catholic school and they were organized that way and it just was a better better match for him and then but my daughter went to school was just easier to take them to the same school and and they goes back and they and from from becky mcdonald is another thing i want to say about my other disciplined and and behavior maybe different in the catholic school is you are paying they you are paying bucks you know is a fourth out forty five hundred dollars a year for us to send her to school uh and if we find out she is not doing her work this is a very different perspective 

Recording: (471/ 9621) 
is really supporting my beliefs so i stand there and pretty much spar with them about it and usually end up getting frustrated and tells me to leave 

Recording: (472/ 9621) 
is it oh that is a good day 

Recording: (473/ 9621) 
yes for attention and uh yeah 

Recording: (474/ 9621) 
umhum umhum but i do not know at that i think the divorce rate has gone up because it is more socially acceptable i am sure there is plenty of people twenty years ago that would have loved to have got their divorce had that been in option um i i think it just i think a lot of it just depends on the way you handle it you know how you how you handle it after after though the divorce is fine i mean not it uh dc which does not make any sense at all 

Recording: (475/ 9621) 
i well you know i i do not see how we can i mean i mean we can refuse to to see certain classes of movies or or watch certain classes of shows but i you know without getting into that first amendment thing i can not uh you know i do not see how we can have a code of contactyeah yeahboy i do not know i i you know i have i have never seen it happen in in my lifetime you know so i do not i do not know if it could be but then of course it can not go on the same way forever you know i can not keep working i do not back 

Recording: (476/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (477/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (478/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (479/ 9621) 
uh essentially dying and so we were dealing with all of this at the same time and it was i mean there was one night i remember we were ready to eat the hospital about seven thirty we checked to see there was any messages at home to see if we heard from him uh and got a message that my motherinlaw had fallen and she was in an emergency the same hospital fortunately so we went down there then on the way home i got a phone call on the south end uh from the hospital that my fatherinlaw had some bleeding so we had to get back to the hospital and then we went around driving around looking for my son this was and this was not unusual it was a horrible period and uh i think what made my wife in any angry so he is the only one that really could control his behavior the others could not 

Recording: (480/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (481/ 9621) 
that is not a shocking surprise i mean i rarely get a kid from math although we do have kids that are learning disabled and they do not understand math either even though it is very concrete 

Recording: (482/ 9621) 
duff right 

Recording: (483/ 9621) 
yeah it is a really disciplined school but a lot of rebionate at the same time 

Recording: (484/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (485/ 9621) 
 sometimes i think that it is just like mass sox and it is like 

Recording: (486/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (487/ 9621) 
exactly huge 

Recording: (488/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (489/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (490/ 9621) 
it is just major thing that you have to do that are a lot more time consuming 

Recording: (491/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (492/ 9621) 
well i should tell them that they should love themselves the girl should that work both of them should love their bodies and not you know give it to a boy that you know falling all over you and your you you feel all good this and that you should respect yourself and love your body and you know do not let do not give yourself to somebody just because you are feeling you are feeling good uh um and the boys i should not the boys need to calm down um i do not i i mean 

Recording: (493/ 9621) 
she uh has trouble driving even at night and stuff like that 

Recording: (494/ 9621) 
actually yes there are a few people that i know that use it 

Recording: (495/ 9621) 
on the issues but i think it does mean a lot to other people so i can not really answer that question how they would voted it because i did not think that mike coleman exactly had kourismany either 

Recording: (496/ 9621) 
oh i did 

Recording: (497/ 9621) 
we are buying it yeah and we should have paid off in about five years so then we are talking about moving to some place a little simpler to take care of 

Recording: (498/ 9621) 
i do not know i like i think uh i think uh high school in general like that people always talk about raising the standards you know for for high school things but um i think um it is it is kind of like it is it is really hard to to like i have thought about before just what is wrong with like the education system in general like i do not i guess but it is more of like this whole like the teacher the teachers talking and like it like information goes from like the like the teachers uh mouth to the students to know it is just like oh go without going through either their brains you know it is like just like romeon is not and this and like you know dates blah blah blah about you know just like it is it is uh it is real structured but it is real hard to think about what that i what to do to change that it is kind of like more like i do not know i mean i had really good like there was a couple really good teachers like my high street teachers and the other teachers were really good um 

Recording: (499/ 9621) 
blessy where is she from out in the back 

Recording: (500/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (501/ 9621) 
you see 

Recording: (502/ 9621) 
and you do not the problem is as a youngster as you grow up you do not realize how much your parents did for you until you are probably until you are about thirty five forty do not realize my goodness if them did you made a sacrifice because no i am learning and do not know what you did and then by the time you are uh maybe sixty fifty sixty now you got to take care of take care of your parents if you had the moral to do it otherwise you just ship them off to the foreign 

Recording: (503/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (504/ 9621) 
the three rs you know i think those are still very important 

Recording: (505/ 9621) 
right and they they were actually able to select a couple from a they talked to a lawyer who range his options and she had a file and they you know two kind of bunch of questions in the answers type thing where he were able to limit to the the three couples and they like the first couple they met so 

Recording: (506/ 9621) 
go along with what my father sings and says and if he wants it a certain way why you just do not question that and i just do not do that it is wrong 

Recording: (507/ 9621) 
definitely 

Recording: (508/ 9621) 
yeah because i do not have a degree 

Recording: (509/ 9621) 
you know a lot of it was the the bitterness of the divorce 

Recording: (510/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (511/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (512/ 9621) 
they do not do it today unless a person is a scholar i mean a three point eight road scholar and i hey okay 

Recording: (513/ 9621) 
so it it is been very difficult for us to particularly the last four years in about the time he ran away uh between the time my fatherinlaw died my motherinlaw died which was in a five month period so my wife is had an awful lot to deal with um and she is had a lot to deal with in that time 

Recording: (514/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (515/ 9621) 
just 

Recording: (516/ 9621) 
right the hardest both the hardest and easiest thing i think i have ever done was knowing when it was time to take him to the vet to have him use and eyes 

Recording: (517/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (518/ 9621) 
no i would not 

Recording: (519/ 9621) 
getting them someplace stable 

Recording: (520/ 9621) 
i think it is the right position to take um but it like abortion that is one of the the big issues that divide people very quickly uh i think it is moderating somewhat uh as the gay reds continue their campaigns um but that is one where canada has to tread very carefully um i was proud that coleman said it and did not and did not back down on that um they told me a little bit about his character um i do not know that i can answer your questions straight forward because i believe in gave i i believe in anybody is rights i know what happens between consent adults in a bedroom is their business not mine 

Recording: (521/ 9621) 
yeah it was like yeah uh it was five weeks early delivering so it was really you know unsplanned as far as when we were expecting it 

Recording: (522/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (523/ 9621) 
i do not know that much about it to be quite honest i did read about it in the paper and i now the whole thing with uh jeve jackson and the whole mayorial kennedy that is how they are getting the weeds over that and i know this is something new on top of that um and it was a front page of the newspaper they looked at it brief um i think there must be some truth to it i do not know the extent 

Recording: (524/ 9621) 
well i would say in springfield yeah 

Recording: (525/ 9621) 
right right and i think there is i mean there is so many small communities less side to to do it you know what i i do not and then maybe also i i feel safer where i live to and and that is an issue for me i know when i do travel down cleveland now the at least it does it makes me nervous oh i just can not even think of it um 

Recording: (526/ 9621) 
umhum yeah 

Recording: (527/ 9621) 
i was forty eight when i retired so it is uh it is great it was terrific 

Recording: (528/ 9621) 
now well it is like you buy it and then you get to do the shopping the fun part you go up and pick out wallpaper and cabinets and all this and that then you have somebody else do that part  but i do not do like major cutting or anything i just like to get something that needs that that i can have a vision i can usually see this can be really fabulous if you take care of this bathroom and kitchen and blah blah blah so that is the kind of stuff and i have only done three or four of them but it is fun 

Recording: (529/ 9621) 
um well i think the price has a lot to do with it because i mean that is what i see see over there that prevents it you know they are a sort of from the little line dress that would be like at the limited here or something is you know seventy five pounds you know at like a dollar sixty five or whatever conversion i mean that is a lot you know you see them in limited and you think whatever the price is expensive but you know really if you buy that you are not really going to be buying you know more than one or like anything else for a while and i think i mean he here there is that sort of like you know he has the most winds or whatever that you know phrase and you know there is that with cd is and whatever but i do not know i mean even with the food and everything else i mean it is cheap people buy so much of it like portions are so big because the restaurants can get it more chilly i mean they are you know the portions are a lot smaller it is more expensive you just eat less and i mean you just see it contributing to everything i mean the o b city problem here and everything else i mean it is getting worse there than it was but i mean it is nowhere is it anywhere near and that is a large part of the like problem with the people were constantly on me about oh why america so sad and like all these things on the television about the americans and i mean that was never ending 

Recording: (530/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (531/ 9621) 
i get a job at it hard park so that all i mean it is just amazing because the money is so good you know you really can not beat it i only after work three or four nights a week and it leaves my whole day free for classes and whatever uh hard park grow it is a at the restaurants up in cutlin so i do not know i mean i i did that off through high school and college and after i actually after i graduated from high school i managed to restaurant for about a year and a half 

Recording: (532/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (533/ 9621) 
i look like a college student that would go here so i have never had a problem so we go and do that and like we are planning a road ship we we we are not we have not decided we are thinking atlantic city or uh florida or new york city or new orleans those situations we are trying to narrow town 

Recording: (534/ 9621) 
it has to be a long standing kind of thing yeah you know and that that worries me more than uh i i understand a lot of the objection is because this is just uh this is opening the door a crack and the next thing you know i you know one legal step leads to another legal step and then we will have gave marriage and all those things but i do not think that would be a bad thing either 

Recording: (535/ 9621) 
i do not remember that all i know how to i know how to do it but i am not sure who taught me how to do it  

Recording: (536/ 9621) 
humum right 

Recording: (537/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (538/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (539/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (540/ 9621) 
um not necessarily the catholic beliefs 

Recording: (541/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (542/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (543/ 9621) 
umhum the reds uh more so than indians back my younger days because they were not worth it then but 

Recording: (544/ 9621) 
 many honors of costs is challenging and organic chemistry is very challenging but 

Recording: (545/ 9621)

Recording: (554/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (555/ 9621) 
uh is there anything else you need to know or 

Recording: (556/ 9621)

Recording: (557/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (558/ 9621) 
well if you want something local that is all you can got and then there is one paper 

Recording: (559/ 9621) 
no i do not i just got too expensive and 

Recording: (560/ 9621) 
um no i have a beautiful niece i love her to death um i knew at a young age and actually one and two make it a permanent decision but doctors at that time would not do it i was like twenty five and i knew no they would not even consider it they said you will change your mind and i knew i just never felt another instinct and it is funny uh yesterday actually last night we went to visit a friend of ours had a baby yesterday two days ago and when we left the room and she has a two year old child and now another little girl uh i said there you know it is it is nice to go down there and see that but i just have no 

Recording: (561/ 9621)

Recording: (563/ 9621) 
it is a real boring boring town 

Recording: (564/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (565/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (566/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (567/ 9621) 
and uh then it takes you know a while you know to get to the person and then i become friend with them it is like for some reason i do not want to do that  

Recording: (568/ 9621) 
oh yeah you can not get them off with 

Recording: (569/ 9621) 
because i have a real good sense of you know how things have to be and it is just see my husband and i are very different we are we are very different but we have we are really lucky we have a fabulous relationship and you know and he is real grateful and appreciative and you said as long as he appreciationates you know like he will come home and say

Recording: (574/ 9621)

Recording: (575/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (576/ 9621) 
we won we were victorian we did not won  you know 

Recording: (577/ 9621) 
no i was sure it was kind of disturbing actually 

Recording: (578/ 9621) 
umhum it does not it does not obviously the civilization going to be dead you know so 

Recording: (579/ 9621) 
it is white just a real down just looked like he is from the ghetto  just nasty guy 

Recording: (580/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (581/ 9621) 
yeah right if you are lucky but i mean there is the person that says that and then there is the other person that says well i sure admire what you do and i would not be a teacher for anything in this world  you know and that the one that is just in all of you 

Recording: (582/ 9621) 
so i i said i said really real nice this parking situation but like i said i usually walk in and today i do not really feel like that um i am i am having a baby in about two weeks here i am really ready to get this over with 

Recording: (583/ 9621) 
oh really 

Recording: (584/ 9621) 
right well when i was teaching taking teacher education classes here uh and observe classroom teachers uh they would always tell me you need to give a grade for class participation 

Recording: (585/ 9621) 
once a month 

Recording: (586/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (587/ 9621) 
you can not you know umhum 

Recording: (588/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (589/ 9621) 
yeah  and it and it been deported 

Recording: (590/ 9621) 
well as i told my dog and she came up and said you know religion is it is business she said oh no dad it is not a religion i said it sure is a business i said it is just the superficial things the packages are attracted up to you 

Recording: (591/ 9621) 
it used to grow wild when i was a kid 

Recording: (592/ 9621) 
so that is where he is all apart 

Recording: (593/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (594/ 9621) 
it is and i saw like one of my friends that works so hard to get an mit 

Recording: (595/ 9621) 
oh it is some committee i mean you have to send them in to some place at the state of ohio 

Recording: (596/ 9621) 
they said they said it was pretty much regular like just a an western weather anyway they said the rice and 

Recording: (597/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (598/ 9621) 
right and and also the other thing is you you have to be sort of compassionate because like you know you are you are working a lot of airplanes and you are wanting answers like this when you have spent something out you want an answer you know the each airplane is supposed to respond with their calls on like if i tell somebody you know turn left getting three six they are on he is supposed to respond tina bay three ninety six roger well if he does not respond then i would got to say it again which means instead of ten airplanes i know i have eleven i am talking to because i still talk to him two times each so you know there are some people that get really mad quick because they want that answer like that where you know i was a pilot so sometimes i am thinking you know 

Recording: (599/ 9621) 
quite with fifty seven cents an hour 

Recording: (600/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (601/ 9621)

Recording: (603/ 9621) 
yeah i had about three or four friends that were actually game 

Recording: (604/ 9621) 
and so your head 

Recording: (605/ 9621)

Recording: (620/ 9621) 
my parents home stood out there in nineteen uh eleven or twelve certainly after they were married 

Recording: (621/ 9621) 
i walked out and i it was not quietly and i  but it felt good and and i did not even know if i was going to be living in the streets but i will never forget the day you know and his wife worked in the office too so i went to her and i said it was nice working with you i am going home you know he can reach me at home and then he was shocked and he just could not believe it and he said you can not do this he says i will not pay you and i said you know watch me walk out the door and i do not want any money you know so i left out um oh it was just a a long drawn out thing i mean it they started out with little things and then it just got bigger like um he had an office off of the main office and it was a pretty prominent uh insurance company and he had his own uh agency and he was a successful i mean he is probably still is out there very successful but i was doing some computer training and he was walking me to the other side of the building and he locked the door and turned around he said why do not you get the first or the front door and it was only hand eye in the office you know and every once in a while his wife would be in there and i just i lost it i i was mad but i did not want him to think that i was afraid i wanted to just be have him to be afraid of me so i just i stopped back to my desk and i said oh great i said not only are you paying to work without to be afraid of you and then i think i did scare him because he started you know he backed off a lot and just his personality and his his in and then that that was a real um slap in the face for him so he was really mean after that so i laughed i just i walked out and picked the kids up at the bus stop off and they are like oh what are you doing i said we are going somewhere are you because it is getting the car  so but um yeah just a couple of experiences like that they will make you do other things so you know i stayed tough when i you know got other jobs and 

Recording: (622/ 9621) 
and then we had goals certain things that like we had a set where we would like to do four hours of service every week 

Recording: (623/ 9621)

Recording: (625/ 9621) 
right my husband jobs them off and i pick them up so he is there for the shorter some other time 

Recording: (626/ 9621) 
and uh you know i guess it works for them 

Recording: (627/ 9621)

Recording: (632/ 9621) 
what do i want out of life 

Recording: (633/ 9621) 
 especially while you know we try to see up five in the morning

Recording: (635/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (636/ 9621) 
getting latexcuted or something yeah that just does not appeal to me too much but i mean it is really not too difficult i mean as long as you are careful and 

Recording: (637/ 9621) 
that is right  straight from a point i know kids but it is great you know and and they really my mom really has worked with them to make sure that that they get into some programs that they need and they are some things now i think that they are developing that they did not have before

Recording: (640/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (641/ 9621) 
well i play actually in two orchestras in the symphony and in the orchestra which is an all amateurured group but um it is it is actually there were times uh when i was i have been in that group for maybe seven or eight years now and there have been times when i have been in that group that have i have thought it had a really wrengeed sound  because they do not have auditions they just take anybody that wants to play and if you take a string player that can not play in tune it can really run everything  yeah but uh i think we have improved a lot we we gave a concert uh a couple of weeks ago at a church in upper arlington and uh i thought it went pretty well a win piece a little bit of mozart uh some concertos so it was fun  yeah 

Recording: (642/ 9621) 
they will just you know send me into the new malinium or whatever you wanna call it  

Recording: (643/ 9621)

Recording: (658/ 9621) 
yeah it is uh you can if you are if you can not go to a girls dorm until i think maybe the afternoon i think maybe eleven i am not sure uh but you have to be out by a certain time uh it is not as bad as like malone i do not know if you have heard of malone they have like certain days so it is not like that but it is still just a pain 

Recording: (659/ 9621)

Recording: (664/ 9621) 
umhum you can do part time you can do three or two day a week 

Recording: (665/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (666/ 9621) 
i am going out of like this and a freak and reachards i swear  but there is kids out there always cutting 

Recording: (667/ 9621) 
umhum because i white his morals and his you know his basic stuff to come from from me really 

Recording: (668/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (669/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (670/ 9621) 
absolutely 

Recording: (671/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (672/ 9621) 
cancered in that in the paper uh but i have sung in well shah and sing in the symphony of course too i have sung for sixteen years 

Recording: (673/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (674/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (675/ 9621) 
yeah i just  by the columbus public schools last year and that is kind of like a tutoring job where you can go you can arrange hours with a student that is at home for some reason uh i had one that just had a baby  and um they it is an interesting job because they look for somebody that can cover the most technical i guess subject that the student is taking in my case it turned out to be chemistry in one i think chemistry once and it it was a alz algebra two another time but they expected us to at least they expected me uh to cover the other subjects too or at least to spend a little bit of time on them so there was english and there was history  so it really requires you to be well rounded  and i i like kind of like that uh i have taught in a couple of other places uh community colleges the college in new yough but i taught at their branch and i taught a an introduction to a collegey class there and an introduction to uh introduction to the arts as it was called  and that was interesting it was uh those are it is kind of an underclass teachers they do not pay you enough to do that they pay you uh per student contact hour and in my chemistry class i was teaching i think total of five or six contact hours a week and they were paying something like twenty one or twenty two dollars an hour  so 

Recording: (676/ 9621) 
but like to some people that is considered a city so i think it is their perspective in that sense 

Recording: (677/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (678/ 9621) 
okay it was kind of uh it was different when i because see because when i went in uh mean if i never had any problem with the black person or or on a really care you know as long as they uh did their job and everything on a piece of the same way today uh 

Recording: (679/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (680/ 9621) 
that is not enough i 

Recording: (681/ 9621) 
what they do uh they have like up to four or five months the first four or five months of pregnancy they allow to maintain once they start to show they do not let them go to the school anymore just for their uh south of the baby 

Recording: (682/ 9621) 
umhum plus you guess many different students and well i just walking over here today you know just gas on you know i wonder how many of these people i walk by you know are going to be here in january because you know because i did you know i thought i was this cool man you know 

Recording: (683/ 9621) 
yeah i really do not know i do not understand why they do not because to me it is the most important freedom we have and people uh bitch in complain all the time but then when you ask them if they voted they go no it makes no difference well it makes no difference if you do not because your voice was not heard um when i was a political action consultant for the ohio education association i used to go around try to get teachers involved in politics um and one of the things i would tell them is that every vote is important john kennedy won if if if you would take all of the the votes you one by and spread it out across the nation by one vote perfor presinked one vote per precinked you know there would just been one additional vote either way and any of those pretty things you know he would have lost uh and so one vote does count and they used to have a list of elections that were decided by one or two votes and when i was with the ohio education says age and i generally did school levy campaigns and many of them are decided by one two seven eighteen nineteen votes um if i knew the magic reason why people do not vote i could sell that and make a make a fortune um but i do not know what it is 

Recording: (684/ 9621) 
yeah yeah because right now you know because he knows how to he is he is learned i would say he knows more of the most kindergartners so i do not even push anything we do not really have a set schedule right now and i am just letting him be creative and you know letting him hope around the house and you know just if i let him watch something it is educational based usually and i let him play on the computer or we will go to different web site sometimes to check out things and i am amazed sometimes what he just catches on just from day to day stuff and just listening because he is he listens to everything  

Recording: (685/ 9621) 
yeah but i i have purposes tried to work clothes or do the back road it is nice from hill yard you can get almost anywhere whether it be here or you know where i have been working on back road so it is not that bad 

Recording: (686/ 9621) 
and he said even when he was in high school they would have they had police officers there so that is not like a new thing but he said you would have people like knives and you would have people with fifth fights but you would like gone to this unheard of you know and i think i do not know where this new trend is coming from i think maybe uh they people feel projected in high school i am sure that it you know like i do not i was i did not feel that way but i would like uh in rochester i looked back and i thought you know i am thinking maybe those people really felt like horrible and like if every day was like so dramatizing to them i think that would be like for four years every day or just like teased or something like horrible and like no one talks to you i am not justifying what they do at all but i am saying that would make them more that would probably in their mind give them the reason 

Recording: (687/ 9621) 
and he does not seem he does not seem to have any problem it is always been you know whatever she wants i know so far it is worked out pretty well so you know i am sure the situation like that i think they are gonna come up but we will we will deal with it 

Recording: (688/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (689/ 9621) 
yeah my momin mom are real close 

Recording: (690/ 9621) 
i do i do um part fairs 

Recording: (691/ 9621) 
you know and and it is just i think they do not happen so often and too many people are even involved the whole thing with the oakland when you are talking circle around yourself but you never say anything 

Recording: (692/ 9621) 
yeah and i told them i was going to call up the tv station so they could fill me crawling out the door as an oil issue employee 

Recording: (693/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (694/ 9621) 
i check my tax machine the next day it says my mother is decided to accept your offer and in that i would had more time to reconsider it and that because of and it is true because my daughter went to the doctor and the doctor and the doctor and said that that point the baby could be here in two weeks and that it was just not going to work for me just a nice man i felt bad and so then i gave him some ideas about how he could sell it 

Recording: (695/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (696/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (697/ 9621) 
well uh one thing you know being uh uh i came from basically poor poor poor uh life style early life and everything you know so uh uh if anything i guess that kind of made me negative uh of course people that had had influence and had money and did not do any thing good with it you know on the firm believer that if you got something that you should share it with other other people i do not always practice what up for each but i think that is that would be a good philosophy to live by uh in people of other religions and everything uh you know i learned a lot about religion when i i was raiseded back to space basically but uh i practice more catholic in anything else now uh but i am generally pretty knowledgeable about judeism than muslims and everything just because they have turned it interesting 

Recording: (698/ 9621) 
 friend who her name was she was not really a french was a teacher when i was in college and her name was mrs becausey and she got pregnant and she said everybody said she came in one day and said it is a girl it is a girl i said i do not out it is the girl what are you going to name her rosie rosie you have got to be getting she is um i am just putting you on  oh 

Recording: (699/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (700/ 9621) 
i do not think it is really i do not think it is really affected me and i mean obviously there is my place to go shopping there is more traffic which i do not particularly care much for um but it i do not think it was ever such a small town where it was like everybody knew each other and it felt like a small community i mean i know in my own neighborhood it is it was where you you went to school with them people once at least once once i went to high school i went to public school 

Recording: (701/ 9621) 
what department 

Recording: (702/ 9621) 
and anymore you are lucky if you know your neighbors because everybody is so busy doing their own thing but as a world i think that everyone has become closer because of the communication that if you do not really actually speak to the people you are hearing about it on tv or radio or by a telephone or whatever 

Recording: (703/ 9621) 
very very much so now fifty years ago twenty five years ago we would call we would tag that description rather than corporation we would tag that as socialism well in the manner we just define socialism fifty years ago we are a very very socialistic government uh today we are in no longer a democratic government as defined back there then huh yeah we are still democratic according to our new definition that is developed over time uh but it is far more socialistic uh but 

Recording: (704/ 9621) 
balps and white 

Recording: (705/ 9621) 
like state heck out of my way here i come my world are welcome to it  

Recording: (706/ 9621) 
they did not like plot any weapon or anything like that it is just fifth fight yeah 

Recording: (707/ 9621) 
oh okay 

Recording: (708/ 9621) 
it was part of that i started wrestling because a lot of my friends did 

Recording: (709/ 9621) 
and it was a nice birthday party 

Recording: (710/ 9621) 
caring your age  

Recording: (711/ 9621) 
i think it is the best thing they would ever the i would the best thing in the world is a wonderful neighborhood 

Recording: (712/ 9621) 
they do because he just he is all out for himself 

Recording: (713/ 9621) 
but of course whenever they need it or right or anything i got a chance home of the men 

Recording: (714/ 9621) 
no kids just think oh it can not happen to me i am invincible 

Recording: (715/ 9621) 
hm 

Recording: (716/ 9621) 
unit does it uh and it was not that i had a bad family unit it was just that there was not you know we never talked about it my sister and i were just talking about that because we were uh she goes we were like you know how did people start talking about sex and relationships and whatnot she goes you know mom and dad hang to me a book i am like they did 

Recording: (717/ 9621) 
we were falling his jeep we kept going longer and we kept going and this other gee i and i always put this in the back and i suppose they knew that german pass worked but but uh anyway they finally got out we finally got out to where there was a bunch of ruined from us or for ruined from our house and foreign buildings and so on and uh yes i know this is it so uh we they have been over some ti is infuntary men around there and so uh we started looking around for a place to land i mean cut our bedrooms out so on and the next morning i do not know i guess i was looking for uh somebody that is in the fire they are warm up from some uh race or something anyway one of the first guys i saw was the guys that will work with my wife and uh office they are 

Recording: (718/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (719/ 9621) 
yeah he was lucky so 

Recording: (720/ 9621) 
well i think it was a a nice thing about what we had uh we had uh grandparents that were not necessarily they were out of state in some cases we did not see them that much we made a part that uh we communicate with the grandparents regularly and when we did it was a special time we um emphasize the fact that um uh you know kids want to do certain things okay they saw their mother go out and maybe do some additional things to work for that uh they aspect we uh asked him that they wanted to go on um a project with the class of what fine but you got to participate in it too we will we will match you with what you come up with we made them part of the owner we gave them responsibilities they grew up with the aspect they learned by being around some older people uh which uh i think was good 

Recording: (721/ 9621) 
um yeah 

Recording: (722/ 9621) 
pretty much yeah he could come in to go follow the leader monkey in the middle whatever 

Recording: (723/ 9621) 
i mean i think that is the best way to address it and as far as the home as actual i think there is kids who say well maybe i am okay i do not know if i am care right well hopefully they will know their trueident eventually i mean yeah some people i mean i know men several men who got married had children and then they decided they were okay okay where they gave him four but they did like one and 

Recording: (724/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (725/ 9621) 
um currently unemployed umhum 

Recording: (726/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (727/ 9621) 
you know does that all go away about second grade 

Recording: (728/ 9621) 
no it uh like i am a business major and i hear the business school here is pretty good so i i wanted to take a look at that my roommate is a business major so he he was going to show me around the they have new buildings i guess so he said he would show me around there uh also i i really do like i came down for a few games and things like that and i like the enthusiasm that people have for this place like asian so small there is a select group that has enthusiasm but nothing like here i mean this is ridiculous everyone is just enthusiastic about the university and even there might be things they do not like specifically about the university they do not i am you do not hear him in any like whole like universal negative things about this about the university ever 

Recording: (729/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (730/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (731/ 9621) 
but 

Recording: (732/ 9621) 
and it was just when drug culture was just you know starting we learned about it in school and stuff and now my parents never sent down with me or about smoking i mean i never really smoked but today with teenagers and everything so out in the open you would have to talk to them about things and just say you know i am going to help you and i you know be there for them a hundred percent obviously those parents were too busy with their own lives to realize what their children were doing so i think they are the ones to be the blame i do 

Recording: (733/ 9621) 
yeah that was pretty bad i think they i do not know what happened 

Recording: (734/ 9621) 
only the only can do it i mean seems like with all the technology in the world they should be able to do something like that the people who have guns and in their home and not have them locked up or in it you know in place that no child could find it they are to blame they are they are to blame um that whole thing with the um school out in colorado um i forget the name of it yeah but when they said that those boys were making those guns in the garage and his parents did not have were clear i just find that really hard to believe if a child goes into garage every night and you hear banging and and they are buying gun not old and you know i then they were totally uh not in tune with what their kids were doing it is one thing them having a side on the internet 

Recording: (735/ 9621) 
i 

Recording: (736/ 9621) 
yeah i have got i have gotten plenty of people  it is funny just when mom asked me so is your mom going to come and stay with you for a week as now  i told my mom she started laughing because i mean of course for her to come over and help out as terrific but if she actually stayed at my house for a week i think we just kill each other 

Recording: (737/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (738/ 9621) 
yeah yeah  it might be umhum umhum 

Recording: (739/ 9621) 
four parties so because it is actually a market it is all done out so i like tonight we are going to the uh gal back pavilional young which is um it next to the high theater it is really beautiful and people do a lot of parties there 

Recording: (740/ 9621) 
yeah it is real wide it is like one of the closest finds and we would go there because they have a huge patio and so you can just sit out and talk and and then uh we play a lot of board games lately too like we just buy access and out of the way my roommates 

Recording: (741/ 9621) 
well my mom lived with just my mom there she had four kids and i was very quiet and did very well in school 

Recording: (742/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (743/ 9621) 
credit card 

Recording: (744/ 9621) 
that is what you want 

Recording: (745/ 9621) 
um so i just you know it was something that was a little familiar with anyway uh and i was just looking for something he parttime 

Recording: (746/ 9621) 
um i guess that would be a slightly different part of them then not really sure how big a problem that is in public schools but i mean one being the girl that did get pregnant she ended up going to public school the next year 

Recording: (747/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (748/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (749/ 9621) 
well no actually my mom did not she was a very bad cook 

Recording: (750/ 9621) 
yeah it or heard ago she thought she was letting you know electing me i said 

Recording: (751/ 9621) 
 plus i do not really feel like the republican party represents the typist at all they get their last political convention like in uh the last presidential action of ninety six they said one in ten of the circuits that were at seven in the convention were a million dollars but granted i know more than ten people and not so to me i just feel like that is not a good representation 

Recording: (752/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (753/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (754/ 9621) 
yeah so 

Recording: (755/ 9621) 
and because largelyly because of the fear of not knowing and not knowing how to deal with the in the 

Recording: (756/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (757/ 9621) 
i mean during that particular i have been around for a really long time and i i would i my views are typically a little bit more democratic but i would not to say that i certainly would not vote um for the person than i thought would do the best job 

Recording: (758/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (759/ 9621) 
umhum at this point uh i am not uh i am not against the urban schools but if it was my own personal child i would move to a suburban area until columbus gets their act together they are in so it is such a bad shape right now that i do think the state will take over the columbus public schools in two years yeah they have threatened it uh and if they do not pull their scores up uh they will you know 

Recording: (760/ 9621) 
and i have you know i have got a couple in chicago and and i have a couple in uh the washington area 

Recording: (761/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (762/ 9621) 
once they turn to adulthood and they feel like going out and shooting people or anything like that i do not think that has anything to do with it 

Recording: (763/ 9621) 
the runways uh well i think the youngest that i met was maybe twelve but that is you know still young 

Recording: (764/ 9621) 
well you know it is because i have to think about how it went back into our income with everything else but i am sure i am sure that i did not pay more than three thousand on it and it you know it did not cost me more than three thousand and so if i had five or six thousand dollars i would i was happy 

Recording: (765/ 9621) 
i do not know that is kind of a tricky question really because on the one hand obviously the kid definitely will get uh made fun of his teeth and things like that 

Recording: (766/ 9621) 
well the thing is there is things you can not explain 

Recording: (767/ 9621) 
my sister is last name is good night and when she had her first little girl she said she is going to name her gone and good night but she did not she did not 

Recording: (768/ 9621) 
and 

Recording: (769/ 9621) 
i mean i i had parents that everything i did was negative i mean they just told me i could not do this could not do that and and so what i try to do is when anything comes up i was thinking of how my parents would handle it and i do a hundred and eighty degrees so you know because you know they just i do not know how i got i sort of feel i am mentally okay now but i do not know how i got here because i have been the other way you know and it is you know 

Recording: (770/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (771/ 9621) 
well i think sometimes it is because the child has not ever been taught somehow or other or shown i have always been the kind of person to believe i never told my kids not to do something to i myself was doing example smoking cigarettes or taking a drink of beer or taking on wine with my dinner and you know you are not old enough but i can now there are some things that the kids can not do at this age somebody can at another age plus you like go out on the beat for example well he is going on that part of the like and i well he is almost sixteen years old now which call he sixteen years old and i hope you will be allowed to go to parts by that time i will expect you to be able you know to know what to do uh but i mean i never did uh and i know  well i will not give you any samples but anyway if if i told them they could not do it i would try them swearing is one of my bad habits and i know that uh i would try very very hard and i got taught one time that i would better watch it a little more carefully by my one little girl and but anyway i have always and i have been apologize if they did catch me doing something that i would been telling them no you cannot do i would apologize seeing mommy was fat and mommy did that i got of the super in my mouth one time ago well well you know i mean now as you want to hear the story in funny well give me just to eat it i was digging the pie and i was taking this pie out of the oven it was a cherry pie or apple pie apple pie wanted to get juicy sometimes and i had not put any aluminum foil or in the only third to catch it and just as i started it out i spil it and i said i bad word you know and just as i said that word leaning down here here here is two little shoes of 

Recording: (772/ 9621) 
yeah i think the terrific for the right things 

Recording: (773/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (774/ 9621) 
fresh 

Recording: (775/ 9621) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (776/ 9621) 
having for bed but  i am sitting here going ooh i mean i did not even know what i was doing 

Recording: (777/ 9621) 
we sat there then for oh and it was kind of funny we were going uh there is another guy in the eye and the lieutenant who was for it observer were going out uh forward observe pollution pollution they uh observation looking at whatever i used to pay itating he was in one jeep head of us and we were following him and of course we just had these little red black out weights he called them 

Recording: (778/ 9621) 
she really likes it well yeah 

Recording: (779/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (780/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (781/ 9621) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (782/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (783/ 9621) 
now 

Recording: (784/ 9621) 
and uh well it just fame one out of the 

Recording: (785/ 9621) 
umhum have a few ideas um i am thinking i might be know be too and 

Recording: (786/ 9621) 
sitting back waiting 

Recording: (787/ 9621) 
and then but the whole band in the cheerleers went to his house and he came out crying i mean it was on tv it was like heart runching 

Recording: (788/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (789/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (790/ 9621) 
but they said all along they were okay they just fought it and they they did not want the pressure from their families 

Recording: (791/ 9621) 
i think so i think so um it is by any stretch it is so sad to see a girl you know have so many options closed off and i do not mean it is by any stretch it is a tragic to have a baby but um somebody in high school is is making a lot of decision she does not intend to make 

Recording: (792/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (793/ 9621) 
because uh again i said you bring up you get wisdom from that as long as you are listening to them uh some people i am sure what they age them they just blow them off uh so that plus you have the i think a understanding of um the schooling they came from uh 

Recording: (794/ 9621) 
aconbillar worth so our company is  

Recording: (795/ 9621) 
i do have some relatives that are um step my step mom is relatives that are there they are actually members of the more in church 

Recording: (796/ 9621) 
yeah it it is i mean you just know where it goes and you throw it in and there it is yeah um let us see what was my dougar card was a lot more difficult than somebody else do it for me 

Recording: (797/ 9621) 
oh good 

Recording: (798/ 9621) 
it ai not that far it is uh 

Recording: (799/ 9621) 
i just can not believe and they said they did not even know what was going on 

Recording: (800/ 9621) 
to build two hundred thousand dollar houses everywhere around me 

Recording: (801/ 9621) 
on different topics 

Recording: (802/ 9621) 
i see it working unfairly 

Recording: (803/ 9621) 
i am i am sure i am sure i am sure i am sure you know welcome is all those dollars but they have like little like a like a like a waiting industry 

Recording: (804/ 9621) 
a famous one  

Recording: (805/ 9621) 
i have never heard anybody going on shooting rampaged that were high on top most of them are sitting home and waiting on the pizza 

Recording: (806/ 9621) 
gave me these leading questions and i said uh huh i know we are coming from i have been coming from with that when i was of high state and so forth and um so i just laid on the line to her 

Recording: (807/ 9621) 
i got on birth control for when i was like sixteen or seventeen but still i did not take the pills all the time and you know that was not very good for me either 

Recording: (808/ 9621) 
it is like you know like some of these places in florida kind of like ruined by taurus you know like fort laud little dayon daytona yeah it is like after after the kids get done  you know they just like oh yeah forget it it is like because uh uh i used to when i was in uh like a freshman uh i heard i heard like going to florida god is like they they do not want soon  you know they want your money but they do not like they do not like your they do not like you know the the trash and the and whatnot that they bring 

Recording: (809/ 9621) 
yeah umhum 

Recording: (810/ 9621) 
depends wonder who the manager is at the time every manager is got a different agenda on what they want you to do 

Recording: (811/ 9621) 
yeah  

Recording: (812/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (813/ 9621) 
i know she sort of knows this is what she has to say at school if she is asked on a test because she needs the points for a grade 

Recording: (814/ 9621) 
the one girl had um showed her her her ultra sound and then that is one is like oh is not cute uh like well wait a minute i might bite you against it they are not always against it though 

Recording: (815/ 9621) 
you know we are right there within a moment so if there is a flood or you know something like that you have called the meni in thursday you know if you are air conditioning so they are always going to have to have people here so i just feel they are either better to down scale the amount of people they have and get highly qualified people then have twenty people that half of them know what is going on half of them do not so but that is tough to do when you are starting people with eight dollars an hour and stuff so that is you know when these mcdonald is are some places that you can make that money so uhhuh to me the thing that hurts me the most out of it is they want to put capital on our salaries so i am at the high scale i can go right now as far as job title there is no other job i can move to until unless i move into supervision or something up in the and i will be out of the union if i do that anyway so but they are gonna put a cap on that where you can only make so much money at a point which i am almost there right now i am only like fifty cents away from that cap and if that is the case if i retire in six years i will be kept out right now so in other words i am going to retire in six years if i do not change jobs making exactly what i make now which that was my worst fear of it all but that was not even on the negotiatingating table they were still worried about this two dollars and gets this house yeah that is what they were fighting for was the low end did not try to get the hospital on the main campus the same 

Recording: (816/ 9621) 
yeah so it is it is a really tough thing to do i mean you have to be sort of organized and i do not know sort of a maverick i guess because if if you could give a test that would tell who could be an extravag or who could not you would be a millionaire because the government would buy that from you because intelligence is not a factor i mean there are people who do this job who i mean are not stupid but they are not college educated and really intelligent but they are extremely good at it and then other people uh that i know of one that i work with a on a regular basis he is got a master is degree and he is you know he reads continuously he is always up i mean if you ask him anything about like what is going on overseas or anywhere he knows that like the back of his hand but he is one of our weaker ones you know and it is uh 

Recording: (817/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (818/ 9621) 
in the way of benefits 

Recording: (819/ 9621) 
my middle collector is the ones that scare to that 

Recording: (820/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (821/ 9621) 
no i was not sure obviously but 

Recording: (822/ 9621) 
oh gosh he does come from saying gas gas and i kept saying i do not wanna go this is the first day of school i got lots of time to do we do not have time to play golf in games i said spell your last name he said g u e uh so  to talk about feeling stupid 

Recording: (823/ 9621) 
but to go see it does not like cats are rent they still charge you out but really okay 

Recording: (824/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (825/ 9621) 
because you got trust the people you are around you do not really want to piss them off 

Recording: (826/ 9621) 
um working on three different uh research projects with three different physicians to where um specific to the traumatic brain injury service looking at longterm out comes and people that have still traumatic brain injuries the other one is a drug study um looking at control of agitation and the other one is a um spinal blood injury research study 

Recording: (827/ 9621) 
exactly 

Recording: (828/ 9621) 
which is great 

Recording: (829/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (830/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (831/ 9621) 
yeah i think i got really good um i would actually have been thinking about it like white departments in the school were good and we went to one to one um the foreign language is really good they have a brazil class that is from like second level 

Recording: (832/ 9621) 
again they said the world 

Recording: (833/ 9621) 
anywaying really farming country and he he went out there from iowa where you so you so you are going to be running my corner down the field and 

Recording: (834/ 9621) 
they are two elderly women that at the church and it this has been about up seven or eight years ago father just mentioned that they had a need uh they had had a church bus and it had broken down so they had a need for to get people to church and i met these two elderly women now the one now is ninety she turned ninety last october and the other one is about seventy eight now and they live together and i take them to church on sunday 

Recording: (835/ 9621) 
it might have been where the president lived they sometimes have like a mission home 

Recording: (836/ 9621) 
for one of the reasons yeah 

Recording: (837/ 9621) 
that and i imagine that is about half and half right now or maybe it is more on this side i do not know so i think that that really is an evolution at this time to tell you the truth what is going to cause the world to end i think what they really mean by by that i hope what they mean by that is that it will end the way it is being run or the way it is being acted out today and it people will not be more compassionate to read about today and just be happy and content and i i still think that that has something to do with everybody getting back to really believing there is a god believing that you should take the other person into consideration it might sound very basic but it is very very hard thing to accomplish especially when they have gotten into this and like you said me me and i got to have this and that status symbol stuff and really if we order people could get out there maybe and start making speecheses somewhere and telling these kids because i know i myself in my own home i have been a collector and i take this back to the depression years when i did not have anything and my father one time while he was out of work guess what i do not know what well their age is it was but they brought us our christmas dinner and the first all baby i ever had and i remember when i tried to wash the thing off that little dog was one of those that sort of mels in the water and my mother said well if you do not know how to take care of it any better than that i will never buy another one and a believe in she did not 

Recording: (838/ 9621) 
hum 

Recording: (839/ 9621) 
really  

Recording: (840/ 9621) 
see there i think there has to be a quality to life too and 

Recording: (841/ 9621) 
and makes you a better person because you get the spirit out inside you driving yeah and that is what is going to take you home i often ask people uh you ask me about marketing 

Recording: (842/ 9621) 
like and uh of is all those little words you are already supposed to know those you are supposed to be able to write a sentence even if it is just a little short sentence like my name is joan i live at love of the street i mean it is incredible it is like the curriculum keeps moving down and down and down 

Recording: (843/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (844/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (845/ 9621) 
no i did not i no i did not want to get to school 

Recording: (846/ 9621) 
cuff 

Recording: (847/ 9621) 
yeah just one concert 

Recording: (848/ 9621) 
as long as you uh see now our our new i was going to be getting another so because i flunked out like in december you know and uh so january i had already contacted the the nba and d air force uh about getting into they are taking their test and everything and taking their uh physicals uh so 

Recording: (849/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (850/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (851/ 9621) 
yeah it all horrible did not you 

Recording: (852/ 9621) 
and i mean it is basically anytime i have free i mean it is not like i have set the schedule when i have to work and things like that it is just whenever i feel like i have to do it 

Recording: (853/ 9621) 
none whatsoever 

Recording: (854/ 9621) 
just totally bombarded and i mean here it is so forced but as well i mean i i came home just before a halloween and you know i i walked into the grocery store and i mean just like right there we are just like cake cupcaes cooking like everything just right in front of you with like all this hollies and stuff on and i mean all the holidays in here are so forced at you and it is such a moneymaking you know and it is so over the top we are there it is sort of like there is a little bit of that and they are decorations and stuff at christmas but it is not so much you know and and just like all the little trink it is not everything that everybody has here to put around i mean there there is not that at all i mean at least in you know my experience there and i mean i can not imagine because you know western europe i think is sort of as much like america as you can get probably you know most places elsewhere in in the world and i mean that would have been a fantastic experience 

Recording: (855/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (856/ 9621) 
the west side 

Recording: (857/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (858/ 9621)

Recording: (859/ 9621) 
hm 

Recording: (860/ 9621)

hi i am a personable  

Recording: (864/ 9621)

i just actually i was going to send my son to a christian kindergarten but i decided the home school instead so i have been home schooling him for kindergarten 

Recording: (869/ 9621) 
 speaking of what movies they are playing uh but i do not really rely on heavenly for news 

Recording: (870/ 9621) 
and so you know even though it turns out to be the real traditional breakdown it is not it is not because i have to it is not because he you know he would not do something that that something else it is the suits would be fine 

Recording: (871/ 9621) 
and unfortunately they have to do what the people at the pets say but it is just i could not be around that and then you know i would go off on people that would do that to bring it in i just feel that would be the right thing to do punch them in the mail sometimes uh i am not a violent man either even as big as i am you know so 

Recording: (872/ 9621) 
better than us i guess  

Recording: (873/ 9621)

Recording: (888/ 9621) 
oh you talk psychology 

Recording: (889/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (890/ 9621) 
it it is like a card dealer goes you know the uh cd player with uh blah blah blah will only raise your payment another eight dollars and you are like yeah but that is about the fourteenth eight dollars you have added onto this you know and it all adds up 

Recording: (891/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (892/ 9621) 
um as far as affiliated with a party i probably respond to um republicans more than democrats but i think given any um given any choice of any party at all i am probably more libertarian than anything else 

Recording: (893/ 9621) 
um so when he uh was a junior then he started in high school he started really seriously thinking now i have got to get it together what am i going to do so he uh agreed to go to psychiatric and uh so he went on ridalyn uh so he took the ridalyn through his the last of his junior year and his senior year now he is on a medication they call uh well future his doctor um does not believe in redland 

Recording: (894/ 9621) 
yeah it was painful but no worse than going to the hospital and for my back surgery back surgery real worse on heart attack ever was 

Recording: (895/ 9621) 
and these people that hear voices they are not halusating they are here in voices of spirit and in many cultures they will tell you most of indigentist cultures throughout the world will tell you and history will show that those people are very of his gift 

Recording: (896/ 9621) 
um weekends i usually try and keep pretty so that i can meet stuff up um and i do not know weekends are usually the the one day the week and then horriblely well scheduled wednesday nights or preparing for travel 

Recording: (897/ 9621) 
some places you are allowed to wear sandals um 

Recording: (898/ 9621) 
are not they you know they come back to visit me sometimes from the high school 

Recording: (899/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (900/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (901/ 9621) 
uh he had an aneurism he had uh high blood pressure which we knew about and uh he started uh you know not being himself he went to the doctor and they did some tests and found out he had this aneurism that had to be operated on right away and he dides uh under the end is setting up a hard of time so it is very sudden and unexpected um 

Recording: (902/ 9621) 
it is these uh the that has a set up where um they have safe places where kids can go when they run away 

Recording: (903/ 9621) 
um honestly i can not say it really bothers me too much um i mean as far as just dealing with gay or whatever it does not bother me at all it is just something i do not want to deal with or what not um so i mean the fact that i mean people in the same sex or living together or married or what not uh that does not bother me like i said it is just more something that i do not know it does definitely make me uncomfortable out in public or something if i see like two guys holding hands or whatnot it i guess just more because it is so different than like what you normally  or things like that 

Recording: (904/ 9621) 
you can not explain it and those have been questions i have been asked by much our children well how did your mom know what she uh how did you know well hey that is a that is one of the risk of life marriage but the thing is do you want to make it work 

Recording: (905/ 9621) 
no human is or violent by any true believe i mean people have been at war since the beginning of man it it is more or less greed they cause this violence that is not media just like the ecstasy was an advertisement showing what you could do tvs showing you violence that you could do if you are driven to it 

Recording: (906/ 9621) 
that it is still really going on you know and his parents accepted him 

Recording: (907/ 9621) 
you know with the system 

Recording: (908/ 9621) 
you know they all get uh side to line inside track by special private interest and that is that is a bottom line and it is sad but there is so i i choose not involved myself in that as much as possible wind and up selling for 

Recording: (909/ 9621) 
so it was it was neat though because pete was my mom was twenty nine and pete was eighteen and so pete was just like some kid who likes to play you know and like cats and and do all this fun stuff and 

Recording: (910/ 9621) 
yeah like underground and it is kind of real big like it is still different too there is still like a really big scene and there is still like a smaller underground scene like 

Recording: (911/ 9621) 
you did too 

Recording: (912/ 9621) 
obviously i mean it is just something that just i mean you do not really appreciate it until you have gone through it

umhum 

Recording: (928/ 9621)

Recording: (930/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (931/ 9621) 
what i liked so much about it is they tell you everything and then you find out that it is not right and that is right i mean there was the episode 

Recording: (932/ 9621) 
um well maybe not columbus in particular but i do not know i was i think i was just a little run out because i was doing the two majors and i was i had a heavy heavy course load every quarter and i had gone to a summer school here as well just to get more done and so i would he had done seven straight quarters and i am sure that attitude i had a lot of hard classes and you know i was just tired of a high  

Recording: (933/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (934/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (935/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (936/ 9621) 
i do not believe that 

Recording: (937/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (938/ 9621) 
and they they have these fads that go through somebody asked me my opinion about the puttimore and i said oh brother you know it could not be any worse than what was the turtles that lived in this oclock 

Recording: (939/ 9621) 
 just when it starts laughing real loud you can turn it down so it do not even breaks the air drive  

Recording: (940/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (941/ 9621) 
they did not they did not bring out uh he only gave ten cents 

Recording: (942/ 9621) 
so and it was fun and i i made uh we made about nine thousand on it by the time we were done 

Recording: (943/ 9621) 
yeah they are very quantity as opposed to like the quality and then so the analysis is held out bottom line in the numbers because actually that is why i do not like like i like business and i i enjoy my business classes but some of the people in my business classes i cannot stand because they honestly they are like oh it does not matter how you treat people and then it is all about the bottom line well in in my opinion they will end up losing more because it costs a lot to hire an new employee and if you have constant turnover and things like that then and if you have a product that because obviously people are not going to care you know so and they they they seem to be very close minded like like this is the way business has to be but the professors do not seem to be necessarily like that maybe i am coming too far going to one extreme 

Recording: (944/ 9621) 
she graduated from the past year so uh but she went to she went home she was in home study so 

Recording: (945/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (946/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (947/ 9621) 
i mean it is something he has to deal with he has to deal with the problems within 

Recording: (948/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (949/ 9621) 
and you have been going to the high states that whole time 

Recording: (950/ 9621) 
and people do not seem to understand that uh it is not like you are collecting data for the entire population of the entire universe of the sample and trying to represent the entire used of the sample for interior very well sometimes it is good and sometimes it is not 

Recording: (951/ 9621) 
umhum yeah 

Recording: (952/ 9621) 
um i mean 

Recording: (953/ 9621) 
even in the package of information 

Recording: (954/ 9621) 
take them to the grocery store afterwards usually so it does take up a big part of sunday but and i do not do it as regularly now because of the advanced in age you know 

Recording: (955/ 9621) 
yeah i uh well and that was really um struggle you know a struggle for money and everything so i would take whatever would come along and when you work in secure jobs like that i mean i had a different job every year i mean a year would come up and i would say okay here we go you know they are either gonna down size or they gonna do something and they always did so i was never really shocked and they did not panhandle or anything and i was never without a job and never had to i never missed um you know i would say it would take probably two weeks at the most before i would be working again yeah 

Recording: (956/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (957/ 9621) 
yeah there is a lot of educated people who are not out to just make a bunch of money so it makes for an very intellectual interesting and but people are trying to live simply there and i kind of agree with that  

Recording: (958/ 9621) 
just you are you are saying you do not need to have a leader in a family and if i am going to be a leader i am going to be the one i am going to be the one not the spring bag oh you keep him in the springtime oh okay dad because i did not know i had to be because there is no father here well 

Recording: (959/ 9621) 
there were six of us born out there 

Recording: (960/ 9621) 
is it ten 

Recording: (961/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (962/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (963/ 9621) 
oh i would say family about i used custom is traditions uh divorce moving uh just looking at my sister my my sister uh i mean she is very happily married but my god i mean they they live to around columbus he is from dallas they met here they moved into indianapolis they moved back here they moved up north they moved back now they are in london england they have been married what four or five years and they think they live in the six different places they are just constantly on the move they just do not have the connection with the family and and i do not know if that is about it it is just they are not 

Recording: (964/ 9621) 
and like the social aspect of the problem so 

Recording: (965/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (966/ 9621) 
but see 

Recording: (967/ 9621) 
she does not have any kids and she works and he works so everybody does pretty good now 

Recording: (968/ 9621) 
so they are kind of throw divided out between the projects 

Recording: (969/ 9621) 
that uh that is an interesting question because he was a a serious contender last time and i have not heard his name this time um what people say they would do they know that they like him because he is um intelligent charismatic uh all those those neat things that you need to to be elected today uh and a lot of people said they would vote for him but what they say in poll they do not know if it would translate over but yeah i think he could i think the right candidate could and i think mike keman this year in the columbus ratio that i mean he crosssonder lines he crossed um party lines he crossed over into all of the city and winning even door to the precent which surprised me you know and and not by just a little small margin i think it was two hundred and some votes which is pretty substantial 

Recording: (970/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (971/ 9621) 
well is they are any kind of you know training i mean are they doing like the whole job training after the two years or during the two years 

Recording: (972/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (973/ 9621) 
and they think those little bunch of people they just do not want to spend any extra money on anything so we are already paying for enough of things you know i do that 

Recording: (974/ 9621) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (975/ 9621) 
 really yeah which happened to me now he was still out of out of our out of our rain 

Recording: (976/ 9621) 
and there was a lot of alcoholics in the military when i was in there 

Recording: (977/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (978/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (979/ 9621) 
yeah  i do not really have any child is recollections of california yeah  

Recording: (980/ 9621) 
you know it just you it did not even matter because you look at the wall right there that is pretty much all you have seen you would see tail lights as you passed people outside the road we was the only people on the road 

Recording: (981/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (982/ 9621) 
which are children of light 

Recording: (983/ 9621) 
once upon a time there was a gentleman named how he sat and he found himself because he was hot 

Recording: (984/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (985/ 9621) 
uh how do you picture it 

Recording: (986/ 9621) 
i do not i think what they were protesting was that they were being involved in it was not that part of their protest 

Recording: (987/ 9621) 
oh yeah they are getting even better though they really are they are much better now than they were twenty years ago because trend is to keep these students in the mainstream as much as possible so teachers are having to learn to for example 

Recording: (988/ 9621) 
and yeah i yeah i should not have done that so now let us just go get some more furniture  

Recording: (989/ 9621) 
umhum right and they are in so much competition 

Recording: (990/ 9621) 
i am not sure it is usually the girls look younger than guys i guess i do not know 

Recording: (991/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (992/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (993/ 9621) 
but i mean at a different time you know so nowadays it is a lot different uh you know 

Recording: (994/ 9621) 
umhum yeah 

Recording: (995/ 9621) 
they do not have any like uh major they do not like on it in major space used list where you get like 

Recording: (996/ 9621) 
course everybody else could but basically what it was uh it was a weird situation in high school 

Recording: (997/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (998/ 9621) 
yeah yeah i i do not know but it then they second guess the mother and she raised her life and all they they can not do that i mean you know it is too bad that you know she was not there to to go on with what they were planning on doing but it is not our right to to take other countries kids even i mean that is another thing i mean come to america we will take everyone in every you know but then we have all these this crime because we have all these terrorist people that come from i mean that is all they have grown up with is the terrorist activities and the mentality and all that they come here and if they can not make it then they will just bomb somewhere and then  but i see a lot of that too a lot of the crime is a lot of foreign things that you know you i you would kind of want to do a study of how long they have been here and you know that would be interesting oh i think there is got to be a line drawn and i think that uh you know if they are if they are caught uh in in any kind of crime or anything i do not know they send them back but uh i just think that we are just too open with that and there is got to be a line to say this is as many people as as we care to you know i mean and i know that is hard but and and it is hard to draw the line but then other countries if it is so miserable there then they need to work on their the country because 

Recording: (999/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1000/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1001/ 9621) 
i think what then they just need to get their heads out of the ground and you know look all over the place for different plays you look on the screen it is different you say well i would have done this and this and this but you know down on the field they have to think that they are going to be doing this you know 

Recording: (1002/ 9621) 
that the that the lovey did not pass um let us seeboy i do not i 

Recording: (1003/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1004/ 9621) 
you know we did that my wife and i have been to san francisco a couple of times the first time was did all the tourist things and the next time was uh she is just gone so i am just going round around and see them spend more time and uh both of them are both of them are good for different you know 

Recording: (1005/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1006/ 9621) 
guns should definitely be kept in the lock box where kids can not get them besides that there is not a whole lot that government can do it is more of the parents responsibility to keep the guns out of their kids hands 

Recording: (1007/ 9621) 
you know that is his real father so i got to sit there and keep my mouth shut 

Recording: (1008/ 9621) 
i have not taken him that yet 

Recording: (1009/ 9621) 
something like that i i do not real much about it 

Recording: (1010/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (1011/ 9621) 
so i ended up doing that for about three months and ended up plunking out of uh ou in the in the first three months the first quarter so uh then i got my notice in january so 

Recording: (1012/ 9621) 
i mean there people think cars will not run 

Recording: (1013/ 9621) 
yeah could not get me to pay the rent  that is yeah  

Recording: (1014/ 9621) 
so we have even been known to slightly start pulling out you know let the garage door go down i would sneak of the car and run up to the window and knock on the window and she is on the couch and she is like i am caught  

Recording: (1015/ 9621) 
and then i got my master is in seventy five so it took me four years that way no i never i just was smart enough to do it before i had kids 

Recording: (1016/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1017/ 9621) 
and apparently that is the way of conditioning in conversation uh one of the guys that i usually go clubbing with he is the one that got me into the little stick dancing and he said uh said this like a sign that says come it on me you know i am like oh great that is that is what i need that does not bother me that does not bother me i just i just i sort of i am just like now you know i am straight if they start if they start getting really you know really pushy about it i am just like i am straight but a lot of times it is funny funny because i will get in a conversation with them and they will be like you are straight are not you i am like yeah they will yeah they i do not know how but they must be it is just being i guess it must be the way i talk or or it is not one of these it is one of these and you know it isyeah umhum yeah 

Recording: (1018/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1019/ 9621) 
oh not very right now and i twenty twenty years the first twenty years i worked at the bureau i was working in statistics so i do not know about numbers and how to use them and what you can do with them how easily they are misinter puted and my wife uh has been a director of institutional research at the university uh uh data research uh they do not really have other kinds of research there uh 

Recording: (1020/ 9621) 
you know or a conversation piece you know or some kind of drovey well here is my here is my dog my labrador and he uh full and uh a lot of these people were uh the dogs were reacting in uh uh they were objective you know and they were because they were not being paid attention to and they were pissing on the carpet and making messes and doing things up and and these people would bring him in and uh uh have him put to sleep 

Recording: (1021/ 9621) 
 so that is why she is trying to get it out of the way now because you know the the the husband he makes you know fairly decent money so you know she does not have to work right now but in order for them to move up the way they want to move up you know after the baby comes she will need to workson when he was in high school had a girl no a little girl friend and she was of see he was tenth grade and she was ninth grade i guess she uh she had a baby and uh believe my son was in the eleventh grade when that baby was born and uh she had a lot of problems running away from home and uh she i you know well my son laughed to move into the dorm here at oh i she and she uh moves in with me i think the baby was fifteen months old and i tried to help the young lady and it just turned out that the you know the young lady was not ready to be a mother my son would not even now is not ready to be a father so uh there was a you know whole investigation through children services and uh they gave me custody of the child temporarily and she is still there and she is four and a half the mother is married and has another child now and then the little one is still with me 

Recording: (1022/ 9621) 
well now they do not 

Recording: (1023/ 9621) 
not as an individual uh well see that is a problem i am it is hard to find a balance betweenika and you know free flow of information uh and as long as people i mean some people like this information uh jerry springer is still running which i i actually kind of enjoy watching them once in a while they get such it is kind of interesting to watch these people uh but i mean and where do you draw the line what people should see in the see i do not know i do not want somebody telling me i can see something or telling me about my kids going to see uh that is my job if i do not want my twenty one in the year old and an eighteen year old it is not as easy 

Recording: (1024/ 9621) 
for like summer projects or something 

Recording: (1025/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1026/ 9621) 
yeah  

Recording: (1027/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1028/ 9621) 
if they want to get married that is their business i do not think it is mine or anyone else to say that they can not 

Recording: (1029/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (1030/ 9621) 
i think more along the lines of like physical abuse things like that um would be probably crossing the line um like if he got they are legislatures uh excuse me if he was allegedlyly beating his wife or something like that obviously then then that will cause a problem with me i i can not say that i would vote for anyone like that but i mean just like small things like that where it does not really threaten the nation or anything and i mean it is something that happened 

Recording: (1031/ 9621) 
and i have one at north and high school she is a sophomore there and they wanted to use a freshman and uh i am married and uh what else i live in uh northeast columbus by seventy one and one sixty one and i the money 

Recording: (1032/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1033/ 9621) 
exactly 

Recording: (1034/ 9621) 
getting married having kids you know and then uh i am not supposed to live 

Recording: (1035/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (1036/ 9621) 
yeah all my family still lives around me pretty much yeah 

Recording: (1037/ 9621) 
and it only took um less than two months 

Recording: (1038/ 9621) 
donate so much to spend okay well that you remember back sometime they were ninety percent tax brackets and so forth so that means ninety cents on that dollar he gave 

Recording: (1039/ 9621) 
people graduate get degrees from a high state working here taking one quarter one quarter quarter and get a degree in history or whatever it might take them two ten years or something you know but it is like why not it is very 

Recording: (1040/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (1041/ 9621) 
where i live now i have lived there for eleven years 

Recording: (1042/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (1043/ 9621) 
and that maybe you would i crash one of the the waiting  

Recording: (1044/ 9621) 
umhum yeah 

Recording: (1045/ 9621) 
but i have been in situations where people of cold races jokes and sometimes i let it pass because you do have to pick the time to to challenge someone very carefully but in other situations i have said i do not find those types of jokes funny please do not tell them any more in my presence do what you want one you are with your other friends but do not do it in front of me i do not even like blonde jokes i find those sex system races in a way and i do not i no one will tell them to me one day when i was still working in it in office they were telling me fifteen or twenty of them in the row and i just kept a stone face that it one two i did  smile they were trying to get me to laugh when i would not but uh 

Recording: (1046/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1047/ 9621) 
okay wow dear dear how do you get back to the original without being part of the original 

Recording: (1048/ 9621) 
i think a lot of people do not understand a lot of people do not it is a mind set uh uh they do not wanna deal with numbers on other people or they want something easy and simple and that is what they are looking for they do not really want to know what it means uh and it is statistic under any certainly any definition is nothing more than an average of some kind 

Recording: (1049/ 9621) 
yeah it was like freshman and stuff for the year 

Recording: (1050/ 9621) 
well all puttoing everything and saying this is dumb and stuff as as far as bringing it too together like socially i think that is just a rough age 

Recording: (1051/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1052/ 9621) 
i can argue up the size of that i am in a luxury i guess where we are in a position where i actually do not have to work so if i ever felt that he was in jeopardy or he was not getting what he wanted or needed i would quit and are beat to to to take care of that but having family was in the first year and a half um i do not know i got all my schooling everything out of the way i cut down to the sixty percent when he was born to have more time with him uh i do not know it is a whole different society with e meals and uh uh computer in the internet age uh the south phones i mean it is in some regard it is much more connected but some aren personnel and oh i think uh i do not know mom is being outside the home i think so many families are forced to do that with the costa and is it the costa is at the once and it is another very material society right now but it is also a very um good economical time too stock market overall up and know it is down right now but overall so the money is been flying and houses and buildings and 

Recording: (1053/ 9621) 
yeah i would i would say you know life application things would definitely need to be part of it i do not think that you should throw out english or math or you know can not believe i am saying this history but  i do not think you should throw out that stuff but i do not think that there should be as much emphasis on it i think more of the emphasis should be on life skills and just being able to make it on your own and take care of yourself and but definitely i think that there is other 

Recording: (1054/ 9621) 
you know i mean it was just like and then it also put a mark on you to go somewhere else so you would never want to you know ever say anything but um yeah that 

Recording: (1055/ 9621) 
oh yeah well i do not know  

Recording: (1056/ 9621) 
what we are animals 

Recording: (1057/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1058/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (1059/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1060/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (1061/ 9621) 
uh i do not even think i would want my kid to go to day care  

Recording: (1062/ 9621)

Recording: (1069/ 9621) 
they get caught with that stuff or and nothing happens and it just that is such a horrible example that here you have got you know some regular some eighteen year old kid that just has a really stupid and he is ten years in jail and then you have got this other guy that does all these really stupid things and he can you can walk it you know and you just it is just it so it is just wrong  

Recording: (1070/ 9621)

Recording: (1074/ 9621)

Recording: (1078/ 9621) 
um if you are going to do something like that you better at least know the risks involved into it and what exactly you are doing before you do anything like that 

Recording: (1079/ 9621) 
because they always dress up and everything when they go to the bars so 

Recording: (1080/ 9621) 
so we have a lot of time together and she says she thinks that was worth it 

Recording: (1081/ 9621) 
oh yeah yeah right and you know what is gonna happen it is only when it gets so bad that they can not even walk to their car they can not even go to to the store without being affected by that they can not save it anymore you know it is the people that if i do not see it it is not there they are the ones that are gonna be the most shocked and they are the ones that are going to be panicked whenever you know because it is getting smaller the world is getting smaller we are we are more populated now than we ever have been so people need to learn to work together and to be together and 

Recording: (1082/ 9621) 
uh because i would not allowed to wear jeans i would not allowed to wear tennis shoes 

Recording: (1083/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1084/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (1085/ 9621) 
oh so the benefits i i 

Recording: (1086/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (1087/ 9621) 
and uh then the the powers that be in the american or immediate size will will go up to this little area of uhoh i always am it six months or four months in feel 

Recording: (1088/ 9621)

Recording: (1092/ 9621) 
 you know we my husband and i were just talking about this i was saying i am not in for the you know george over on nineteen eighty four and big brother syndrome at all um my ideal situation would be that somebody decides who should have kids and whoops and all but i do not think god is going to come down and do that so you know what i mean we can not really decide that but to be honest i am for it um it does not have to be well i am not even sure tube is is pretty permanent um but even if they could do something like on a yearly basis and give them two hundred dollars a year that is still not still much cheaper than them having kids um and then if they i give them more money they clean up their act just for them um as far as it being races i do not think i think they are missing the point because i am sure there is some run away white teenage girls out there too or mexican or white night um 

Recording: (1093/ 9621) 
i have got them sounds like i bought a dog 

Recording: (1094/ 9621)

Recording: (1095/ 9621) 
yeah i have got a son he is a senior daughter boy 

Recording: (1096/ 9621) 
i was reading a thing though and uh just i think was yesterday where uh you are uh minority and you are you are uh majority you know uh it is always been that and you know they were trying to make it seem like it is different it is always like like the army have always made forty percent uh minority in sixty percent or something of that you know the air force has always been uh like seventy thirty or something like that you know because the standards is a little bit hard to get in and a lot of people do not want to get into that even they do not want to take them test and everything you know uh my a a cousin that was a uh spent twenty five years i think in new army because that is they could have done better but that is all they wanted to do you know beautiful sargent and stuff like that you know but uh i i still think a lot a lot of times immediate 

Recording: (1097/ 9621) 
you know so it is you know if you if you have a problem if you wanna talk to somebody well if if somebody you know personally does not they know somebody 

Recording: (1098/ 9621) 
you know not that what you wear makes you but he is just he is a good role model 

Recording: (1099/ 9621) 
exactly 

Recording: (1100/ 9621) 
well i thought about that you know i mean doing something in the anywhere uh even as a vet assistant but um with domestic animals um 

Recording: (1101/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1102/ 9621) 
uhhuh and then when i got my masters no i did it no i did it during um the weekends and the summers and the nights and took me about um well i started teaching in nineteen seventy or seventy one 

Recording: (1103/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1104/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1105/ 9621) 
yeah i guess i am just so secure about who i am than i do not know a problem with it and i was in the men is league club for a while so there is a small percentage of the people in there that are uh that are gay as well and that is and and i really made friends to a lot of them i guess i mean i guess it is just because of my personality i i i really do not know what it is but apparently something in my personality calls out to them and says come hey you can be my friend i am cool i am all right even though i am not even though i am not one of you i can still be your friend which is sort of what i try and eat because i am on very very religious say they are person community is very very mean towards homosexuals and that is just not right i mean they are people they are making a mistake in in my eyes yes but that does not mean i am a i am a christian i go to nondonominational church um i do not like the nomination nations i am not 

Recording: (1106/ 9621) 
a lot easier market yourself 

Recording: (1107/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1108/ 9621) 
yeah he he and three other people well a lot of them had signed the union they have to have almost everybody signed for it but um he was one he can not do that it is illegal so he but he sent a form letter with everybody it was exactly the same to the three people that were fired except for their names or changed for the these like basically made up reasons 

Recording: (1109/ 9621) 
yeah i have two other sisters  um one of them is well it is funny because we are all divorced uh the five of us were all on one of them is on her third marriage and we are all on our second except for one she is divorced she has it be be married and then my oldest i told him back and i guess he is not been married 

Recording: (1110/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1111/ 9621) 
she is the type of person i love doing away 

Recording: (1112/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1113/ 9621) 
but she is young and everybody is prejudice against her and i have got to sit there and shut my mouth and do her work 

Recording: (1114/ 9621) 
no that is not what i mean now i do not i do not mean it that way but i just mean i think i think it is better that if people are are get to a point where they can not work it out i mean i think that that a lot of times you can do things like counseling and those types of things and and maybe there is some way to work it out 

Recording: (1115/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (1116/ 9621) 
you would be sleeping on the beach before you even shell out that kind of bugs 

Recording: (1117/ 9621) 
i do not understand that 

Recording: (1118/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1119/ 9621) 
uh essentially all the big enough to make as much the us on it is actually all over the world it is international 

Recording: (1120/ 9621) 
uh when she she was they were their pregnancy but she did not i am just going to public school 

Recording: (1121/ 9621) 
oh yeah umhum it is the biggest thing 

Recording: (1122/ 9621) 
i seen the uh big amnator and what is that that what is that the opera house yeah right right on the right on the ways that does you know whatever it is gorgeous 

Recording: (1123/ 9621) 
i would say it is not any different than having a man i mean it is a person she just has a different way of going about it will probably 

Recording: (1124/ 9621) 
yeah and uh i hadprerogative i could have gone somewhere else and made more money you know but the bad part was that the university is trying to do away with civil service civil service is a good thing and the bad thing you know you do you had step raises and everything so at least you did have an increase back yard now a days you have nothing 

Recording: (1125/ 9621) 
yeah  that is it 

Recording: (1126/ 9621) 
well i was uhastabilus to about responsibility and that is the rather thing before i went into service as over the son in a family of ten 

Recording: (1127/ 9621) 
uh was not going into too much detail uh one of my best friends from high school well he stayed at home and i went off to come on this and i found an amazing church down here and learned a lot and and really stumble across a lot of interesting doctor in in ahe feels actually strongly that anyone who believes that is like a heritage and he just went off to alaska with another friend of ours and before he left for alaska i actually took the time to to uh i did not want to but he was sort of pushing me into it because we were i am in each other and uh he sort of pushing me into it a little bit and i told him you know i am like a lot of this stuff that you have talked about uh you know talked about not liking i believe and i and i told him i said i can i can understand if in our minds there is a problem but we accept the fact that the other person is wrong at leaving at that but that is not what you are thinking you are thinking you are looking at me and you are knowing within your mind he is evil he is wrong and i said that is not right did ii i honestly do not know uh people get really scared they are certain i mean like they are certain denominations that will take one it is sort of like the other limits they will take one book or one script out of the bible and it expand it to crystal clareity and they will just run with it and that is what my mom came out of um her her denomination that she came out of she is not part of it any more denomination she came out of it um some of the more devout churches within the apist dollar christian church were talking men said on the one side and women said on the other women wear little finney is on their heads no jewelry the servemany is read in three different languages it is really whacky stuff 

Recording: (1128/ 9621) 
you know the only thing that really really saved my son i think from getting into any kind of trouble or anything was he was so involved in sports 

Recording: (1129/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (1130/ 9621) 
no nobody has a daughter and that was from high school uh his girlfriend uh got pregnant and then he stayed with her and they tried to work things out and they never got married and that was when he lived in canada so she lives in canada now and he goes you know he talks to her all the time and then they are real open about that i mean she is real good about letting the little girl come and she will stay this summer with us and and she will drive up there and see her too 

Recording: (1131/ 9621) 
i got told you i can be an idiot 

Recording: (1132/ 9621) 
so you you pretty much have to be you know it can not be middle class and you know it have got to be you have to be rich or you are not 

Recording: (1133/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1134/ 9621) 
no no she uh 

Recording: (1135/ 9621) 
no he did not he did not 

Recording: (1136/ 9621) 
unless you get stuck in traffic 

Recording: (1137/ 9621) 
no she is oh she is really playing smart i mean  

Recording: (1138/ 9621) 
umhum yeah uhhuhyou know up there uh now i had saying it was cool public school distance you probably districts you probably would get the same this year but by being kirkwood you know rather till this small and everything uh i think we maybe had uh a hundred some kids in our graduating class you know so uh i felt i get better attention when i wanted it you know uh then i would have at a at a bigger school 

Recording: (1139/ 9621) 
yeah i mean getting a gun does it i mean i was surprised like i i would i am never owned a gun but i am i think it is pretty easy to get one actually 

Recording: (1140/ 9621) 
i think it is really you really have to be careful who you put on the medication and how much you put them on and how long they stay on it and and most kids do not like being on medication because it makes them different they do not look at it like gee i am really lucky i live in a day in time when there is a pill to help me concentrate they look at like well my my friend is had to do it and they say well i know i have not have not done it you know  they look at it like it is a big pain because i got to run over to the nurse and get their pill at lunch and generally the long acting the time released ones there is only a couple of them a couple of the different medications that are out in the time release and they only work for about forty percent of the population most people try the time released and it wears off and it does not do what it is supposed to do so they go back to the six hour dose you know one the morning one at lunch and then their friends all know that they have to go get their pill and then they like to the lunch line and you know they just hate it so but it is not something they can a lot of kids will not i guess they are in d now just like we would be and they say well it does not help me i do not need it but when you sit down and say okay what other things are able to do when you are on it that you really have trouble with when you are off of it and they see it in black and white they go oh yeah 

Recording: (1141/ 9621) 
i think so yeah like their hair cuts are a certain way and can not you have to shave and um you always have to have your tie and your jacket if you can unless it is really hot there is it is different also depending on the climate 

Recording: (1142/ 9621) 
in his true uh so that is the most powerful thing i can do when i can turn it over to god and say god this too damn big for me to handle do you think you can work on them maybe helping change this person is heart or their mind because i can not do that um so you know that did not mean you know that i cant yet then 

Recording: (1143/ 9621) 
when i did school levy campaigns uh and a couple of other campaigns to me the biggest thing is is what the the campaign does on election day called get out the vote that is the most important thing that can be done um i used to always at the beginning of a a campaign for a school level get a list of all the registered voters and of course i had a very limited population in a school district and i would have the school district compare it to parents and the first thing i do is register parents because many of them do not vote uh and i read a study somewhere that the average person in this country does not even begin to vote until they are forty if i had known that when i was in college and work so hard to get the vote changed eighteen because i could not vote till i was twenty one and i was upset you know because i wanted to vote for certain candidates because of the vietnam war that was a big issue and i could not uh i had a wait till i was twenty one so there was a bunch of us at college that you know worked and did some volunteer work to get that whole thing changed if they would knew that they were not going to vote at eighteen and we were going to wait till they were almost forty i would not i would not have wasted my time uh but anyway um you get parents who are usually younger especially of the the first second third grade 

Recording: (1144/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1145/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1146/ 9621) 
and then it is different businesses like white castle or pizza one of the pizza places and uh some of the super markets and things and they are advertised you know throughout the community so these kids when they have problems they might want to go to uh hookle berry house and they do not have a way so they go to a safe house and they call and they have a you know group of volunteers that go out and pick these kids up take them to hunkydary house which is not far from here so i did that for a while but uh was not very uh satisfying because i really did not feel like they were doing anything to really help the kids and hook them very well 

Recording: (1147/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1148/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1149/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1150/ 9621) 
well i am saying on the whole world and they are and everybody is so busy now with all the things that they have to do even me i think maybe he sounds the same way but maybe not as much as i have i thought when i retired i would get this done and this done and this done and i wonder now how i went to work and still got something to eat done so i got home and i am sure i am doing it just as fast because over and over again people say i have never seen any of but it was as much energy your always doing something but and i think it is just that we do not have the time 

Recording: (1151/ 9621) 
oh sure 

Recording: (1152/ 9621) 
right so they do not come see men i guess they should not care because i i would just like them actually if i would like them just come for about payments so they can see them at this wonderful home we have that is like everybody is was showed off 

Recording: (1153/ 9621) 
yeah it is a lot smaller than columbus though 

Recording: (1154/ 9621) 
and i think it was an article this last wednesday into the spatch in business section as to how the pc still can not regulate it and because that they want to dereate telecommunications uh and so for the past month we have not been getting tillmobiles for us each we had a back one we are paying for and what is going to happen on this whole thing is he offers us a a a lot of that to with with uh week and now uh if we have a contractor let us say over in dayton and we are calling from the jeansville office i would rather make them long distance we can go on our pipe and if we have a line going on dayton we can make that cause if it is a local call avoiding all of long distance 

Recording: (1155/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1156/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1157/ 9621) 
do you have one now 

Recording: (1158/ 9621) 
kind of balance the brother out a little bit  

Recording: (1159/ 9621) 
um i do not really think there is any huge difference uh i can not say from what i have seen the people that went to the catholic schools uh they are a little bit more disciplined and know how to like organize their time better and things like that like i mean most of my friends have gone to the public schools are really overwhelmed by the medicine that they have to do here 

Recording: (1160/ 9621) 
yeah i mean i guess so i mean i always spend the weekends with my dad and i spend the week with him 

Recording: (1161/ 9621) 
uh because there is not like uh like i could find lead lead person because it is just one person doing it most of the most of the time it means like people do have groups that play like taco beat or more into music but it is not like a lead singer who like you know it is like that so i do not like that at all 

Recording: (1162/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1163/ 9621) 
it is extremely difficult to deal with 

Recording: (1164/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1165/ 9621) 
oh yeah we have probably been five six times now and 

Recording: (1166/ 9621) 
talk to them like you know this would be nice down um 

Recording: (1167/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1168/ 9621) 
um not really i mean i have been with a few people that have just i mean just randomly gotten kind of jumped at me they did not steal anything they just beat them up for no reason or what not 

Recording: (1169/ 9621) 
yeah it was cutting twenty pounds in three days 

Recording: (1170/ 9621) 
white white women who had actually had it done than uh than um hispanic or african american but i do not know at least in that case i mean before we were talking about the government i mean at least in that case there still is a choice i mean there is money involved but it is it is not so much money that it would erratically change your life in it sort of you know it is not thousands of dollars it it was two hundred i believe and and that is that is you know i mean if is that amount of money is going to sway you in that direction i do not know i think i think i think you know there is the debate about ten years down the line but you know as they are going to be something that is going to make them change you know what is it you know what is it going to be and like how how realistic is it for you know what percentage i mean i do not know anything about the sort of statistics of people who do clean up their act or anything like that but i mean i do think if there is that element of choice it is a lot different than you know the government saying okay this is your cut off one minute but i mean the statistics they were getting giving on um the average number of children that these one were having and you know the average number of children that were just taking to the hospital unless they are or you know just dropped off wherever and and the state that these children were in and their life span and everything else i mean you know there is the human rights for the mother but what about the human rights for the the child is life you know i mean i think all that is forgotten about in so many of these cases and you know the same is in england you have one thing oh because they were talking about you know i mean again this was just an idea they were kicking around but sort of you know somehow sort of forcing these young girls to at least be in birth control you know in whatever way and and again that everyone was up in arms but it is sort of like you know what is about child is quality life can to be when their mother is just you know 

Recording: (1171/ 9621) 
it took us ten years to have them you know i think my mom generally thought i was doing birth control and we were not but you always knew the set of asr tone undertones you know is she here is not she wants this like one i am not going to discuss it with her because i knew that that was an oner to her but i was not but she did not need to know that 

Recording: (1172/ 9621) 
and too much prejudice there really is still and it is that but it there really is 

Recording: (1173/ 9621) 
because now they are getting to the age where they are fighting more and you know and you have got a boy and a girl and you know it is 

Recording: (1174/ 9621) 
i know 

Recording: (1175/ 9621) 
in what they would say about americans and american culture like at that discussion group you know in front of you you either so 

Recording: (1176/ 9621) 
one thing okay go ahead well one thing uh i was thinking you know that i have a perspective on that maybe like lots of people do not is how columbus has grown up 

Recording: (1177/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1178/ 9621) 
so and i figure i have a hundred up to a hundred and fifty four credits and so i am i am up to like ninety four right now and i figure that would be a decent i mean it translates over because we are in the past years it will get on that stuff there but it it is it is like i am half way to three fourths down with uh with my degree so if i wanted to transfer now it would be like because if after this point if i stay any longer then a lot of the credit card will not transfer be a waste of time because most places do not like to take more than half so that is why i just see it right now i should look 

Recording: (1179/ 9621) 
i mean just like beauty and the beast there is an extreme amount of violence in there uh you know just everyone there is a a bad dark side in the story so children just start and i mean it is in there that and then including my own daughter she and i swear i had her watch mister rogers all the time but now that she is older she watches tv she is addicted to d tv something terrible in that so of course our children are uh so but i think you know i was i did not have have tv when i was a child child and i think you know it it stimates the imagination in some ways but i do not know what direction that imagination really goes you know in but there is a tremendous amount of violence in front of everybody is space anymore as a matter of fact i am getting so i do not watch the news 

Recording: (1180/ 9621) 
henderson oh and tandy 

Recording: (1181/ 9621) 
oh um national tv you always also get foreign situation 

Recording: (1182/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (1183/ 9621) 
i do not know i mean in it was my money so why should it matter 

Recording: (1184/ 9621) 
absolutely 

Recording: (1185/ 9621) 
just people coming from high street and just happen happen to be centralized right there on south avenue 

Recording: (1186/ 9621) 
i can check my account see how much money i i got and they will actually list things that i have bought you know like how many your your is sixteen account and all that so you have bought check clearing if you have bought checks cleared 

Recording: (1187/ 9621) 
well i i think we oh yeah we are we are church gore is but just to be going church of course is not uh is not being faithful i think it is just uh sharing yourself uh with one other in daily lives uh listening to someone out reaching someone where it might be that is uh the mystery that uh i think our our our lord is giveness 

Recording: (1188/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1189/ 9621) 
so i do not know whether they did any damage or not but 

Recording: (1190/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1191/ 9621) 
it really is 

Recording: (1192/ 9621) 
yeah the police said that they have been there many times 

Recording: (1193/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1194/ 9621) 
oh did it 

Recording: (1195/ 9621) 
it is like an advertisement for it 

Recording: (1196/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (1197/ 9621) 
what a one million dollar check they hit the the door shut you know 

Recording: (1198/ 9621) 
so but that is you know i ended up selling the attorney got most of the money so little i had i invested some and then i made some bad investments when i went off my medication and uh you know blue it  and you know so that was my responsibility on my phone but uh you know how it was just uh years of years of end up frustration and i just i spend it i spend it in uh you know on orthin ah doctor is way but you know i had fun doing it 

Recording: (1199/ 9621) 
yeah but the same time every day yeah 

Recording: (1200/ 9621) 
she was well you had dad deacoff money i said uh lord 

Recording: (1201/ 9621) 
i hope so yeah  

Recording: (1202/ 9621) 
they would not know i went to two different doctors and they said you possibly will change your mind and you know i was single uh maybe if i would have been married they might have considered it uh but they said no way would they do it and we are talking fifteen years ago 

Recording: (1203/ 9621) 
but uh the company wanted to move to florida and they did not want to move 

Recording: (1204/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1205/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (1206/ 9621) 
r u g e 

Recording: (1207/ 9621) 
i probably vote for bush over clinton 

Recording: (1208/ 9621) 
all right so i hesitate see that it would really help them uh it would just be better if somebody could you know keep their eyes open or if we had um more counselors or things like that to deal with everything including that 

Recording: (1209/ 9621) 
this is weird 

Recording: (1210/ 9621) 
yeah but the ones that they really needed to do like two seventy like seventy one and seventy i mean that i do not that is a bottom neck area you know and they really should have done something of that twenty years ago you know 

Recording: (1211/ 9621) 
i think so he is he is not being forced to go in any direction that he is not ready for yeah i was going to college and and going to work and i mean i think that their personalities are different too though so he was very independent but i am not sure that that is just his personality or if it was just he was adopting to his environment and where he was put me in point and being in day care from a very very young age and and then you know my youngest he is never been in day care at all so 

Recording: (1212/ 9621) 
that is still enough for me 

Recording: (1213/ 9621) 
once 

Recording: (1214/ 9621)

Recording: (1221/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1222/ 9621) 
i think there spends a lot of mistakes made by everyone on that and i really think and even though i would hope there was a better way to handle i think they did the right thing by taking them away from the other the cousins i mean they have the cousins have been stressing all over you need the family he needs something well there is a much closer family than your father and that that they love this country and this stuff well then accept the laws and follow them whether you even agree with them or not uh i i i it was very unfortunate the way it happened and happened and but i think the government should not allow the go on as long as they had 

Recording: (1223/ 9621) 
about uh thirteen years i think my dad uh once he got through with his residency and everything we moved from the high field and he joined to practice and we have been living there ever since welli would say fifty five sixty thousand people and actuallyland is probably about twenty five to thirty thousand people but uh manfield is sort of fascinating  and per capita murder rate in mannil high than there is a lot of um a certain community that lives there that normally would not live in a smaller city like that but there is just a lot of there is a lot factory there is a and not really there is all sorts of there is all sorts of of reason of um industry in the man isville area but there is a lot of it no actually most of it most of it is state most of it is state it is been it is been there for a while yeah we have got the mannville state reformance where such an but i do not know if that is our claim to fame but but we do we do have that in mansville but uh actually there is a little bit more a little bit more in fact it is a lot lot more low key it is more of a it is more of a um agricultural county um ashland city is right where i live it is i mean we are like five minutes outside of ashland city but ashand city is the county seat for ashland county and uh man isfield because there is nothing to do in man but uh the man is field branch campus uh it was really boring it is really boring um dad my dad was just getting himself settled in the community and and with his job and everything my mom stayed home so she stayed with us for a while um most of my early childhood memories are from where we lived in mannfels it was uh it was uh it was uh it was a real it was a real do not talk do not ask community i mean you really did not know your neighbors unless you went over and set high they never came over so yeah yeah yeah we lived in the suburban area of manson sort of like the uh the white collar area where all the people who were businessmen who were getting themselves established so and then um we switch churches and also my dad opened up he he and his partner opened up another uh branch office in ashland so we moved to the ashland area abouts about eight years ago almost nine years ago and we moved to ashland to get halfway between um dad is my dad is not centralally located between the abilus office the hospital that is in abilus the hospitals that are in man is field he is about he said it is about a twenty minute drive from all the places you need to be so it is really a lot of fun because you know we live on a we live on an now we live on an eighty acre farm yeah got a nice big house of barns and tractors no animals well we have we have got a dog but but um it is it is a farm in the sense that we have got a barn we have got tractors we lease we lease some of the land out to uh a farmer who who actually works out and plants stuffno not to be on a farm though my dad is a doctor  

Recording: (1224/ 9621)

Recording: (1225/ 9621) 
um but now see and i would never never you know you do not know until you can get a reaction like that 

Recording: (1226/ 9621)

due upon to do honda could do so that they can learn the other cultures and the other values but they just do not do any of them 

Recording: (1235/ 9621) 
no because i think there is the ideal in everything and if you can not live up to that ideal standard but you do the best you can do and i think that is where i was coming from i mean even now uh i mean i could never agree with abortion let us say i i would stand by the church and and most most of the church laws i do stand by but i guess the birth control issue became so personnel and uh it was just a decision that had to be made and i had to make it with it what i thought was a clear conscience and what i did i do not have any regret for it what about you 

Recording: (1236/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1237/ 9621) 
well yeah i just give you the rough estimate of uh two and a half miles from here 

Recording: (1238/ 9621) 
well it is not that there is been too much gross i mean growth is good but now they need to stop 

Recording: (1239/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1240/ 9621) 
hey crime is not is an interesting term uh all crimes all murders are hate related i i am not sureit that is uh it is difficult i we had civil rights laws many people were opposed to those but it was in an effort to correct years of institutionalized races uh and and maybe something like that is needed to stop years of institutionalized hate but a crime is a crime and you know are you going to give someone who murdered matthew shepherd six life terms as opposed to someone who murders someone else one life term i mean murder is murder and there is already a a law in the book so i do not think we need to have a hate crime over and above that you know it the the people who murdered matthew shepherd should be tried and hopefully convicted on the facts and should not have anything else added into it i i think doing that is going to do the same thing that uh many of the civil rights and the uh a firmitive action programs and the bing did that people is going to turn people against uh guys like they turn people against blacks for a while although ultimately i think it did make a difference i i had a i have a black friend at the ohio education association who was very active in the sixties in uh opening up restaurants in the south and marching and you know going to yeah opening the schools in the south and i said for one day are you disappointed that things are not better uh you know that people still hate blacks this is ten fifteen years ago and she said no she said that was not my goal my goal was not to change hearts and minds my goal was to change behavior and the behavior changed except now i never thought i would let us see an all white jury convict white men of uh killing a black man we are in hearts and minds now 

Recording: (1241/ 9621)

yeah there was just something about that stink far better far more than a paddle a paddle was kind of a whopper than it was end up with a stink uh it kind of got your attention many year in theirman you are in therethere is another little old little system that you can not imagine that a person does not cute i mean my mother used to say at my motherinlaw was written there is another old written over here that the last movie told a lot of them i a whole right i do not even worth worth you know we were right over right you have a right in the you know right right over right but you know right right but you know right right but you know right right but you know right right but you know murderers is the way we was have murder now on the plea bar the plea bar i think you know the most they they ever was just uh we would just need to be more people who can murder them that is just that and the electric chair electric chair i still believe it because they sound like brisk they should have ten years of uh what do they call it legal from the legal right appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appealsalsates appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appealsalsed appeals appeals appealsalsed appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals appeals apelsalusahus gonna 

Recording: (1255/ 9621) 
right right but that helps me just getting away getting my mind cleared doing a little bit of reading going wait a minute you know i  it is so i have used alone  but you know yeah 

Recording: (1256/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1257/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1258/ 9621) 
 uhhuh 

Recording: (1259/ 9621) 
yeah i was i was driving by the the hunking and everything so yeah my roommate is not going to uh let the bait about it but it we did not really resolve it 

Recording: (1260/ 9621) 
and even if you had two full blood from two different crimes and they had child the federal government still considered some half blood 

Recording: (1261/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1262/ 9621) 
um actually i was over there when all of that happened but of course it was all over the papers and you know i think i mean i i do not know what it was like really here i can imagine but i mean they are especially they really focused on um not collin byne but the one with the the younger kids in arkansas was it daveiswell i was there for both of those but you know in the first one you know they they put the picture of the little kid in combat gear holding the gun everywhere and calling by and you know every paper had a slightly different slant on the story and you know their facts were all over the place but that is another kind of issue but uh what i think caused it i mean i do not know i think that like more should have been made of the fact of you know this like terrible sort of resentment for the other students and and you know i am not in any way offending the guys who did it but um you know something is wrong not only with them but in the fact that they were like driven to that point where they felt so hated and so maligned or whatever that you know that you would even think of doing something like that um i do not know especially with you know everything that was said about the families and you know they did not seem to of course you never really know but they did not seem to grown up in this you know terrible environment in you know have that sort of you know preconditioned or anything like that um yeah i think a lot of more effort needs to be made you know to sort of you know playate those sort of situations and i mean who does it is sort of another question because you know the teachers already are overworked and underpaid and you know all those kind of things but i do not know 

Recording: (1263/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (1264/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (1265/ 9621) 
eighty so we just uh we just sat around our love and twenty university yeah 

Recording: (1266/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (1267/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1268/ 9621) 
yeah i think they are really helpful and i think that it is the only way that a single mom or anybody raising kids can make it there is really but there is so much fraud and there is so many people that take advantage of it that it hurts the other people that really need it you know like with me i did not want to stay home and i was perfectly capable of it but if i did not have the ambition that that i had i might have stayed home there is like nine you know there was even a mother that lived across from me in my apartment complex that i would get up and go to work every day and she would have food delivered to the front step and she drove that year is car i mean she had a brand new you know like whatever year it was that is the cars she had and i i would just shake my head and wonder how she ever got away with it and you know at that 

Recording: (1269/ 9621) 
yeah oh yeah you know people i was in kindergarten with i graduated with so it is kind of like the small town thing which uh has goods and bads but i do not know they you know my parents still live there and i still associate with a lot of friends i graduated with that still live in town and you know they just had a twenty year reunion here a couple years ago and a lot of participation in that and so 

Recording: (1270/ 9621) 
you can not take that away from it so uh you know like you said i think they just go through a lot of stuff but i mean i had a lot of uh and a lostly towards my dad is poor things that happen you know uh price not being near when i was you know was younger and stuff like that and uh if any of them are brother got close to the johns of the you know because he is three years older than me um then uh but but you know now uh they they are both out but my parents have passed away but uh you know i do not know they they are both out but my parents have passed it away but uh you know i do not have any any of them on the most towards it at all you know i kind of like it is kind of like a drawing up thing i i guess you know i mean you you kind of sit there and say eight you know you did the best you could you know i mean 

Recording: (1271/ 9621) 
is it often so similar to where i am coming from 

Recording: (1272/ 9621) 
that is a very strong animal and as the old man that got lifted twenty five feet in the air against the pine tree found out and my opinion when that stuff happens when i see when i see someone light the horns of a bul on fire in spain in tourment the bowl and then all of a sudden the bowl gets the flame put out and the bowl runs it is going through the person is leg and throws them around and kills them right near death i do not have any sympathy for them 

Recording: (1273/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1274/ 9621) 
he would be lost 

Recording: (1275/ 9621) 
we can get to the beach and take them there we have family in florida we have family in hawaii we have family in virginia beach so 

Recording: (1276/ 9621) 
because i went to oregon and of course uh the greater part of the population out there are more socialist than they are capitalist and they are easier to deal with than there are more reasonable people in my opinion much more reasonable but then i come back to columbus and all my family in and in all i am the minority in my family and believe me and uh they are very into capitalism and their lives are working pretty good for them so 

Recording: (1277/ 9621) 
do not i mean make 

Recording: (1278/ 9621) 
and then a couple years later he was working on a job in the plumber coated fabric plant which is a plant that makes all coda fabric they make uh the main thing is uh auto up on the street car up on the street anyway they had big rolling machines that roll this stuff out and those fumes came off but so they had a big hood and exhaust system 

Recording: (1279/ 9621) 
i do not know i i do not know if it was drugs or  something ridiculous and they they they a lot of people and i think a lot of the the police force and a lot of other officials are are pretty much in agreement that he should be signed and he feels like like he is just not going to you and that we do not have any um the the mayor can not nobody can actually make him resigned that that is something he has to do on his own and that was one of the big things as far as you know to work it was theater was state i am going to make him do this which is something that she does not have any power to do um in that and and and about how how they just continue to get raise and they are and they are not doing very much about it in and less than fifty percent of the police force is actually in police kinds and and a lot of people are are doing dust jobs and this types of things and i i guess a lot of people just are not very happy with the job he is been doing 

Recording: (1280/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1281/ 9621) 
well in in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in in the in in the in in the in in the in in in the in in in theumbyous part of it you know just saying trying to be protective of the ways 

Recording: (1282/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1283/ 9621) 
because of the gayism 

Recording: (1284/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1285/ 9621) 
um he moved to texas because like he was moving into like he was going to smu there and like so i moved back from from florida back to up up here because i did not want to i do not want to go with him because texas sex texas terrible and like um so it sounds like my mom she like my parents got divorced when i was like five or something and so 

Recording: (1286/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (1287/ 9621) 
since march too 

Recording: (1288/ 9621) 
and it is couple months 

Recording: (1289/ 9621) 
yeah so it she is funny because she is gained twenty six pounds and then she does not look pregnant she has on she had on a regular sweater today 

Recording: (1290/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1291/ 9621) 
right now but i knew him when he was eight ten months was over and they work every day 

Recording: (1292/ 9621) 
i have never heard it said before like you said that that the reason women are not precious because they do not show any kind of uh spiritual leadership i i have never heard that said instead there must be people who think that 

Recording: (1293/ 9621) 
but that is my plan 

Recording: (1294/ 9621) 
but they just do not have those 

Recording: (1295/ 9621) 
you know historic building and i am like there is no history in america you know 

Recording: (1296/ 9621) 
red because i do not know why that was but it sounds like it i guess and yeah i was caught a lot of little things 

Recording: (1297/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (1298/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (1299/ 9621) 
um yeah like i knew uh like a lot of people who who live down on hudson lake over the summer before i went to us u um so i mean i like campus and everything it is just like of course she is different than campus you know 

Recording: (1300/ 9621) 
but if you love they do love someone you want them to do what you right and you want them to learn and if that is the punishment they have to pay for something they did wrong you still love them but you are loving other people also in other words you are not letting the fact this is my child so he can get away with murder but this is another where i am not going to let get away with it no i am sorry if my child committed something that this other one would have had to pay for i am sorry you have done that dearly but i and i love you dearly but i tried to teach you different i do not know where you went wrong i do not want to did wrong or whatever but you got to pay the penalty i mean you have to draw the line somewhere but now you sit family yes i think the reason that it already if you look back everyone was born and everyone was loved by the father mother when they were little and how their former dearers are and the education the uh the way they were uh taught as they were growing up does help them be become what that president is what that any politician is any minister or anybody else it the way you are raised i firmly believe in the things you were taught does have an impact on what you do the rest of your life and i know a lot of the things that i have done in my life are definitely based on what i saw happen back here you know and i think that it it it there is on everybody so that is why it really begins with the family 

Recording: (1301/ 9621) 
yeah i mean it is just sort of like the whole reputation of you know america just being like the country of access like access positions access food access money you know everything you know and it is it is you know i sort of have mixed feelings about it the first time when i was gone for about a year and a half and i came back and you know this is i had done like a lot of traveling over there and everything and really loved the whole atmosphere especially of mainland europe and everything and i come back and you know where my parents live they were all these you know new strip malls built and stuff and i just felt like i was in you know just like giant kmart land you know i mean it just was so overwhelminghum even though obviously i would grown up with you know back up my whole life and you know not that i sort of can not just completely but you do when you have been away from it and to come back and you know to go into these like cavernous places and like just the other day my friend took me to east and then i mean you walk in there and i do not feel like i am in columbus you know i feel like uh it is got to be california or something just because it just 

Recording: (1302/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1303/ 9621) 
yeah and she said you know in in the the last three or four years she just wrote it out so she could retire and she is being very dedicated uh very dedicated teacher and she just it was a job then and it is hazy that happened to good teachers 

Recording: (1304/ 9621) 
if you do not make a child support payment they should do the same thing i do not know why they do not have a system like that 

Recording: (1305/ 9621) 
so the state would pay for it 

Recording: (1306/ 9621) 
um when i went i went with my friend 

Recording: (1307/ 9621) 
and she said she get back to me on it well i have never heard nothing from her and she is done that to me i do not know how many times

Recording: (1309/ 9621) 
oh yeah that is beautiful yeah 

Recording: (1310/ 9621) 
i agree with it yeah 

Recording: (1311/ 9621) 
oh is that right 

Recording: (1312/ 9621) 
but most of the time like i try and uh like most of the time it is pretty easy i guess pretty straight forward sometimes it is really aggravating when 

Recording: (1313/ 9621) 
uh it is not true i mean uh some of the older men in older tribes in different tribes um 

Recording: (1314/ 9621) 
um i go to northland high school right now 

Recording: (1315/ 9621) 
i do not go to city center too much although i like it being there if i want to go to it 

Recording: (1316/ 9621) 
no because i have a stigmaism just that you know the glass is cut in right here and that is irritating 

Recording: (1317/ 9621) 
no my mom uh she is not in blood uh she is seventy years old but they go out usually to yard sales and stuff like that stuff i do not want to do 

Recording: (1318/ 9621)

Recording: (1319/ 9621) 
oh okay  

Recording: (1320/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1321/ 9621) 
oh yeah and and i i probably step on your toes here but i i am not a firm believer if mom and dad both working i my wife works until we had children then she stayed home and once they got into school she worked at a school so when they were gone she was gone when they were home she was home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home and when they got home and when they got home and when they got home and she was at home and she was at home and home and she was at home and home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home she was at home and home and home and home and home and and i hated it i hated coming home from school by myself every day there was nobody there to talk to you know and i did it for years and and i just feel that you know and i hope you do not have children yet do you good because to me parents who put kids in day care and uh you know after school programs are like people who have cats and dogs i get up in the morning and i feed my pet my child then i put him in the kennel and i go to work and i go gee i need to go for some drinks after work and go to the movie we will just put her in another kennel after work can not we take her from one kennel until the other kennel we will be back a little bit and then i go and i have all my fun and i go pick her up at the kennel and i bring her home and i dust her off 

Recording: (1322/ 9621) 
so be it you know we had the ribard is out there helping out the the ti is fine t manford was not it but then after g guys came home the little they went back into the house and business all these idealized say hey we can do something here because those days well they said well i will go to this little odd job you know we one of those things mom will do a a pick up little extra things here and so forth they have a primary bread winter but she got this odd jobs just to hus a their needs for that budget they bought things on a cash basis as they needed it they did not go out and spend on credit uh many of them some of them have myself here but business said hey let us produce these lines little uh you want a refrigerator room we can make it for you know we can make it cheap for you because we can mass produce it 

Recording: (1323/ 9621)

Recording: (1324/ 9621) 
yeah and we are one of them  taxes is supporting strong they have like 

Recording: (1325/ 9621) 
have come over get something to eat and uh that is uh that uh but i think that has a lot to do with it uh i do not really know that tv has that much because i remember coming home as a kid watching how do you do it even on that stuff and of course it was not the uh buying that stuff maybe you can see on tv now or uh but i do not really think the media is has had that much to do with it it is just a different time now i i mean i remember uh one of the things they saw when i was a kid on a newscast you know was uh uh the vietnamese guy uh the big hong guy getting the brain boat out on national tv you know and uh uh they did not make me good and they do not want to do that you know so then they and they new one not wanted to you know because my brother was in was in vietnam he was in new army and uh when i got my notice he is like three years older in the you know he said they do not they do not dress you they put you on the front line so i am going to list any air force anyway so 

Recording: (1326/ 9621) 
oh it was it was easy 

Recording: (1327/ 9621) 
uh he was a uh railroad clerk 

Recording: (1328/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (1329/ 9621) 
and really relaxed as much as weird as that might seem you know and so for me though it is like oh he come on i do not really want i do not want time to do this kind of relaxing stuff i just want to get going and do the rest of this stuff so 

Recording: (1330/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1331/ 9621) 
you they were not even allowed to believe in god 

Recording: (1332/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (1333/ 9621) 
so therefore they can they are not public they can put whatever they want 

Recording: (1334/ 9621) 
i do not know the wide state but i do not i guess from a career perspective they say it is not a good idea to get all your degrees from one place but 

Recording: (1335/ 9621) 
um so i just came down here then 

Recording: (1336/ 9621)

right well here is here is a can of manwoods it is a dollar fifty them will give you fifty cents off well gee if i just use the recipe on the microwave cookbook i can get home for like three cents but but you know why it is convenience i can throw up the microwave and it will be done in five minutes you know like mashed potato is a microwave or you know it is like hell low it is you know i i can understand how people do it because they come home from work and it is like i do not want to be a cook i do not want to be a clean up so i will pay somebody do this pay somebody that and pretty soon you see all the money they have been making gone 

Recording: (1340/ 9621) 
yeah it is 

Recording: (1341/ 9621) 
and the um that was part of the process there to how to work work and work up there too with people but if we could just share more 

Recording: (1342/ 9621) 
because i have seen things that are not physically possible 

Recording: (1343/ 9621)

Recording: (1346/ 9621) 
oh right 

Recording: (1347/ 9621) 
right  

Recording: (1348/ 9621) 
uh to uh we never use the word ever but uh i am sure playing people use the word on us you know but we we shared everything that we had and supposedly we had a true uh sharing but uh in terms of government i do not we were not ready for that because we had more of a matriarch one woman who was just sizeive and made decisions and we would eat  because you know but uh if it if it we could get ourselves to the place where it would work that would be great and i would very and i then and the year that i lived in that community was one of the best years of my life uh was 

Recording: (1349/ 9621) 
yeah yeah there is a big water area that is something to do with a little mermaid or whatever but they really enjoy all that we try to do as much as we can with them outdoor type thing we do a lot of camping we do a lot of vacationing we try to go to i see your at least uh her parents live in cape cod so they 

Recording: (1350/ 9621) 
we start more again they have never learned and the reason why you are throwing it carry out too much in front about saying hey you got to do this approve this to me no we we we black a one heck of a oh moral status in this country we are losing every day and so we start looking our themselves in in the mirror at night and say i am sorry myself i am probably why did i may not have made a dollar a day but i understood somebody a day 

Recording: (1351/ 9621) 
i thought it was very strange but um 

Recording: (1352/ 9621)

yeah yeah yeah 

Recording: (1358/ 9621) 
uh in the long time ago uh when they sign a decoration or everything they said you know build a fence around your place and and take care of your own them you know and i think basically that is the way that the laws should be i think there is times when you need to be when we need to go help out other people but we try to be too much of a policeman uh 

Recording: (1359/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1360/ 9621) 
right well  as most people do not like to hear uh relatives and stuff i am taking your uh 

Recording: (1361/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1362/ 9621) 
i am sorry yes 

Recording: (1363/ 9621) 
i mean not saying that they had to believe what we believe but just even just that their attitude about life was so down and 

Recording: (1364/ 9621) 
now that is okay now that is the pokeie month now that is the pokeie month on it all in their book you like i heard somebody somewhere say my five year old can name all hundred and fifty poke him on characters but could not tell you his phone number and and that is true with mine 

Recording: (1365/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1366/ 9621) 
in any pregnant see three weeks in either direction is considered fullterm 

Recording: (1367/ 9621) 
yeah that is i am surprised they are not getting a lot of heat from that but is that park up around wherever 

Recording: (1368/ 9621) 
that that is going to be a problem they said bring bring water you are going to definitely like they have no dress code which is nice so i am just going to be sure it is some good walking shoes and and it is easier because it could get rough it can get real rough by that 

Recording: (1369/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (1370/ 9621) 
yeah well i did not realize that to have kids 

Recording: (1371/ 9621) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (1372/ 9621) 
i mean i am sure nineteen i was seeing some really bizarre things too uh but you can tell that he is the thought about it 

Recording: (1373/ 9621) 
all right number one none of them had a the privileges of having a car where they could drive and go anywhere they wanted when they got out of school and they got a job and they bought the car and they had a car they were not allowed to have my car and take it and run over to this kid is house or that kid is 

Recording: (1374/ 9621) 
the way many people have started out i liked him he had on sensible things they would almost what we are talking about now i think sometimes but he and we are to keep up with uh uh i can not remember all the name of those shows that do not watch them but i am doing oh freeze one of them and all these other people it is just like her and of course they get into the smut and everything else and what they have done on all that milwaukee and i think he decided he would do something on his program more for him to keep his ratings up so you know and and see that is what you mean by getting into what this person does over here and that is another thing we need to teach your kids because john doug jingogis doing it does not mean that is right have the courage to be yourself and say no some people i think are terrible sometimes but 

Recording: (1375/ 9621) 
and they they say that is the city and my school or where i grew up was more than double that just over double that it was like sixty thousand 

Recording: (1376/ 9621) 
you know any schools that have a thousand people i just can not imagine i mean you know my my high school was like four hundred people and we thought that was big at the time and just to have a thousand just to teach me people and just to try to monitor different things i mean it is got to be so hard you know in checking everything and 

Recording: (1377/ 9621) 
yeah i live in uh seever hill oh oh from around but around new orleans oh i got i think they are a hundred and seven you have us here for just from my class alone 

Recording: (1378/ 9621) 
and they used to have the laser light show downtown they they do not have anymore uh you know just even if you do one thing for your mind 

Recording: (1379/ 9621) 
you know you can do anything for fifty dollars a week you know you work two two hours a day you know for a week and and fifty dollars for two kids is really not that much a week so 

Recording: (1380/ 9621) 
well i think the people that made that law should uh also too not be able to keep their jobs from more than two years and see how they like it 

Recording: (1381/ 9621) 
and i had it you know uh in other ones it is it is a struggle with that thing and understanding it takes time to understand it a lot of people a lot of good people are helping me to try and understand it uh i was trying to let the fear of that um although i am not afraid to die i am afraid sometimes and i all die before i get a chance to do what i feel i was in there to do which is just the basic things falling with some money have children raising 

Recording: (1382/ 9621) 
uh me too years ago  

Recording: (1383/ 9621) 
and they but now my daughter is my daughter has twin sons who just are a year out of college and uh i think that they are one they one of them particularly is i think in good moral good sort of guy and that one i do not feel like i know as well but i i really think that they are both good and uh 

Recording: (1384/ 9621) 
well i work i work part time kind of because uh i worked full time when he was you know one and i did not uh i felt like um the babysitters or you know whoever saw him more than i did and that because i would allow my son more than anything in the world and i felt like he needed me you know so i went down a part time and i am struggling more but i would rather see my son have me you know 

Recording: (1385/ 9621) 
umhum i moved just just moving to uh up over one sixty one cleveland area uh i would lived up there for a year so i just moved back up there and uh while i loved it was because of the the city the traffic and everything where you get around campus you know it is a lot and they saw husband husband also but down here even with with the kids and everything going to school but basically it is kind of laid back uh more up there it is all go go go uh 

Recording: (1386/ 9621) 
well it is harder than i think in in some ways than people think uh i went to the teach ohio fair last year to look around and did not see that much interest in in uh chemistry or general science teachers uh i think the market is it is fluctuated back to a point where they do not need as many right now you are not claiming for us umhum 

Recording: (1387/ 9621) 
is it really 

Recording: (1388/ 9621) 
i think people are still fairly racist i do not think it is near as bad as it was but at the same time i mean i can not say i blame the white community so much for it i would say it is probably both the white and i guess any other raised relations um i mean as far as like if you look at the black community things like that yeah i have like b e t uh yeah i have like united neitherer college fund things like that where they are almost aggravating themselves by having these organizations because they are geared specifically towards black people and i think in the way that is almost aggravating themselves from the rest of the community because they are not given out equal opportunity to people that need them um um it is sort of like the same thing white people were doing you know thirty forty years ago where that they had their white organizations or whatnot um and i think it is sort of going along the same lines where there is still a problem of it but i think it has gotten better at least if nothing else 

Recording: (1389/ 9621) 
for that nice noise and uh some in smern uh which is outside at atlanta but girls that i met through school and stuff 

Recording: (1390/ 9621) 
but yet that leaves the door open for who to get in trouble 

Recording: (1391/ 9621) 
i mean i am sure there is some but it is not as extreme as some places that i have been 

Recording: (1392/ 9621) 
i think later on when he gets a little older he will be you know 

Recording: (1393/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1394/ 9621) 
what would you do 

Recording: (1395/ 9621) 
oh i am sure 

Recording: (1396/ 9621) 
it is not that the property taxes are that much higher anyway it is that um the homes are worth more because of the school system 

Recording: (1397/ 9621) 
definitely definitely 

Recording: (1398/ 9621) 
oh it has you know your basic uh last which i like to go to lasterous and sears and jc penney is and uh no i would not want to drive to full airers to go to the stores but if they made some outlets over there you know i would be happy with that uh there is just a lot of smaller stores you know like victoria secrets and bookstores and toy stores and athletic wear stores um a lot of those i do not even go to get some keog set up outside you know with little the little curts and different little things they sell just like your basic kind of mall 

Recording: (1399/ 9621) 
put to a prison and you know you pack it full and you had a gun 

Recording: (1400/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (1401/ 9621)

Recording: (1404/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1405/ 9621) 
you always used to get a union job you know 

Recording: (1406/ 9621)

Recording: (1410/ 9621) 
yeah it is going to have to be from the bottom up i and everybody keeps and i i am just getting a kick out of all the adversements and everything and they are coming with two thousand on it well i am hoping people are making a big deal and making a big convertisment in selling a lot of stuff because of it but i am hoping that it does meet since people are so focused on it does mean a shift in consciousness i hope uh why too okay i do not know what that really stands for  have to think of some words there but you know whole since everybody is just making it into a big deal that maybe it will be a big deal you know 

Recording: (1411/ 9621) 
when i got here but i was in one of those you know used stupid uh palmes relationship shall we say and i kind of need to disappear and um we never told him where she she had just moved

Recording: (1417/ 9621) 
hum 

Recording: (1418/ 9621) 
yeah and uh and a lot of performing art you were expected to take something in performing individual arts every year which um which is good for him that the catholic school he was going to go to was big on sports and my son is not athletic and so this is that is why he did not want to go this this is a good choice for him for that yeahyeah uh yeah well uhbut i think they seem to be uh the whole administration all through the board and just just it is not as focused i do not i do not know how it is great it is like the teachers just sort of it seems like they almost had the feeling they are on their own where it is more coherent than the catholic school is i agree it seems to be very clear they are all going in the same direction working as a team uh i do not know have you ever listened to any of the uh columbus board of education meetings that are on the radio 

Recording: (1419/ 9621) 
and i have heard the thing you know i am a real father and all that we want to do all that

Recording: (1426/ 9621) 
yeah well looking at me oh you want it all anymore you know i mean and they are making thousands um but yeah i do not want to do that anyway i want to go somewhere i have got somebody helping me kind of you know uh just in a acquaintance of mine uh and that is kind of a head hunter and i have given him the idea that i want to either work for an attorney that is going to make some changes or you know do something that way i have got a lot of administration you know in in manager and things like that background so i can have fun doing what i know how to do but also accomplishing something as what i am going to do i have not found it yet i have got an interview with a radio station now and that is kind of 

Recording: (1427/ 9621) 
well most kids what they do is they tell something in the body this should be in the body way up here in the most people get ahead of themselves 

Recording: (1428/ 9621) 
oh yeah it is like whoa my ed was like oh i got to be here i did not do that  it looks like you can not do that  i have looked out yeah he he broke into like oh my god i cannot even remember what it was but he had all these numbers for credit cards and he was breaking into uh selling them on the internet 

Recording: (1429/ 9621) 
no because i know people that are married do not take care of their kids 

Recording: (1430/ 9621) 
yeah i am a democrat i have never voted for a republican in my life even when i lived in oregon and i always the door to my catfield i did not vote for him  we had a dime and juby at and coley at the voice age and colejee at the voice age and colejee at the way it came and they voted i thought it was in some ways kind of a close to race i mean i did not think that there was much that much difference in them idealologically i think you know she would do just about the same as he is he might be a little bit better but uh i in terms of having them black mayor i think that is good for columba i think 

Recording: (1431/ 9621) 
um enjoy them now you get the terrible tuesdays good through which is which is cool and uh i remember one time one we got in a big argument one time when she uh when she turned teenage and uh my called her up and she was on the phone with somebody else and they sat there and said well give them calling long distance she goes so i am talking to my girlfriend and i said so what hang up on her car back 

Recording: (1432/ 9621) 
oh okay okay umhum umhum umhum umhum umhum umhum umhum umhum umhum  my brother my older brother lived in bloomington for a while and he ran a music store on the square in the center of town it might have just been called been called been called bloom blooming to music i am not sure sold fjord and  on the square right across from the corehouse yeah yeah 

Recording: (1433/ 9621) 
so that is i think that is a problem too you know everybody says well i do not want to get thirty eight thirty you know so 

Recording: (1434/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (1435/ 9621) 
yeah he is a father 

Recording: (1436/ 9621) 
big deal you know common sense to hot you do not put it in a sensitive area while you are driving to work um but she sued for ten million and the paper said she won ten million she did not i mean after that ten million award was given by a jury then uh mcdonald is allowed uh an appeal after the end of the year so she does not see any money for a year and that is if they do not appeal but ninety percent of these big corporations have the money behind them they have lawyers behind them so they can sue for an appeal 

Recording: (1437/ 9621) 
oh uh professor i it it was interesting i mean it is it is a it is a lot it is a lot to remember a lot of terminology by i enjoyed it 

Recording: (1438/ 9621) 
typical dorm room 

Recording: (1439/ 9621) 
um that is probably when they started yeah um 

Recording: (1440/ 9621) 
yeah um yeah i it is hard because i i do come a i am a christian so i believe the homosexuality is wrong but i do not like i said i am not going to condem them uh at all like i said i have friends it i understand what you are saying um but i think that is something more for the parents or the teacher to pick out than maybe that child um is having a problem and then sending them to counseling of some sort and not actually incorporate it in a thirty student on some though uh it would be nice if we had more of an open environment schools and if teachers really had the time to notice that maybe somebody had a problem on the talk to them about it and then send them on that counseling one way um just because if you are going to teach it to a a large amount of students i am not even sure if that one student would listen because all the rest of them would not probably be making cracks and just make them feel more do you know what i mean so i do not 

Recording: (1441/ 9621) 
that is pretty cool 

Recording: (1442/ 9621) 
el goor really does not entice me at all he claims he invented the internet 

Recording: (1443/ 9621) 
um i sort of agree with the fact that if someone wants a gun they will get a gun it does not matter what they do to try to make it so people can not get their hands on guns they are basically always going to be around and people are always going to get them if they want them 

Recording: (1444/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1445/ 9621) 
no not really um all my good friends from well i would say like out of all my good friends from high school one of them you know two of them are still here 

Recording: (1446/ 9621) 
well i what what what neighborhood do you live in because i you know i see asians and indians in all everywhere but boy they do not live on my street 

Recording: (1447/ 9621) 
uh my stepmother is 

Recording: (1448/ 9621) 
yeah you know that is that is the thing so i think just being aware and then also like i said with with all the i mean and i am and i am self opinioned in this too and anybody that knows me i look at all the advertising i look at the advertising and i look through it and i i see the mazors and i see colds and i see sears you look through and you say oh okay you know you are looking for things to buy well then you got a two whole two pages of women and braves and they are looking at the camera they are sedly looking at the camera and you are just like how many how many different braves do women really need that is not for the women i am sorry you know most women by the time they are buying bras and no what choices they have you know they do not need all that but then it is funny because then i keep flipping through and i look at them and the men is heads are usually cut off they are not wearing any kind of revealing under wear at all i mean it is just so uneven so we leave these these guys or these poor boys that are growing up we push all this in you know and then expect them to deal with it you know and they see tv shows and and everything else that you know it is okay to be with five women but boy that woman is with more than one man and she is you know i mean i think it is what we teach our kids and that goes back to the government in society and and what we are allowed to to show our kids you know you get involved in the free speech and that is fine but wait till those kids grow up and and wait till those people that were pushing the free speech get smogged or you know anything else happens to them 

Recording: (1449/ 9621) 
not they actually going through it you know to me it was not her but it was your afterman basically you know you just 

Recording: (1450/ 9621)

Recording: (1456/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (1457/ 9621) 
and 

Recording: (1458/ 9621) 
oh i see 

Recording: (1459/ 9621) 
i did i did 

Recording: (1460/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (1461/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (1462/ 9621) 
so that is you know they a lot of my decisions were based upon that 

Recording: (1463/ 9621) 
um but you know i think what they did was fairly good they did not really as far as i remember at that point at least they did not well they must have done gone into this sort of moral issue uh but i what i remember was more of a scientific approach 

Recording: (1464/ 9621) 
for a&e is for uh not getting hurt  she works at fed ex and uh her crew is always getting hurt mainly her 

Recording: (1465/ 9621) 
first to second quarter 

Recording: (1466/ 9621) 
no no but hopefully when they do get to one strike somebody i say somebody because i right now i do not really think we have that in place but we would need more of uh um wind strike stepping stone you know and i let us face it counseling is probably not going to work uh and somebody in that they would almost take uh i do personally know people that go into that i have a learn in at here in columbus and actually work with the families and work with the kids and actually are in their living there showing them you know it is it is one thing to go help them and then leave that and go home to your nice house i do not i admit it i could not do it but um if if people really did things like that i think there would be hope for them because they are actually friends or actually people that have been in that environment and come out those type of people i think might be able to reach them i will not be able to reach them probably just because what do i know about it um i am yeah i agree i do not think it would be a deterrent at all initially but if we had more things in place than somebody actually realized the background and trying to get them out of that hopefully even if you save has of them it is better than than anything 

Recording: (1467/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (1468/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1469/ 9621) 
she is okay right 

Recording: (1470/ 9621) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (1471/ 9621) 
well it was both really because there is the kids live there since i live there now thirteen years ago  and being that long in the same neighborhood just does not really get it with me 

Recording: (1472/ 9621) 
no not often uh my daughter has a very uh intense life  and uh so uh i do not see them near as often as i like but we just do a one day thing because it is fairly easy to drive to toledo so i go real early in the morning and uh spend six or seven hours with them and then come back and or she does the same the same thing she comes down here and we just do the one day thing now because of the children she worries about the children and blah blah blah you know so it is very interesting so i know what they are doing and everything but i do not i am not old fashioned grandmother 

Recording: (1473/ 9621) 
i guess 

Recording: (1474/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1475/ 9621) 
it is and plus the thing is too like when we bought our house we had looked for months and months and months and i wanted an old house it was built like nineteen seventeen i wanted an old house that had not been kept up 

Recording: (1476/ 9621) 
yeah they going to change uh 

Recording: (1477/ 9621) 
um they did briefly like cover things like that with like religion and health classes things like that 

Recording: (1478/ 9621) 
it is been it it is been remarkablyably well i mean i have not had any problem i found out pretty early which was kind of strange in about four weeks and i went in and and i had a check up and my doctor he said i was about seven but they wanted to do an allter sound well the thing if they did this allter sound they did not find anything so which was really kind of creep because they did not know because there is that whole two little pregnant thing and all this stuff and and the guy that did them my gosh found was not my regular doctor and he is kind of well he he is just a little abroad for me and he says well you know if this is one of his you know you could have a lot of serious problem just you could die it would all this stuff and wait a minute i said you know i said you know i am just about ready for this but after after we figured out that it was just the time period other than that it is gone really well i mean i just i and i know we just been in started with my classes last night and there was some woman in there they are huge i mean he is gone can not even get off the floor and i just feel really bad for them so for me it is it is gone very very well i mean i have not really had any problems 

Recording: (1479/ 9621) 
i think my daughter jennifer is very active uh not so much uh the type of work that i do but i think she is very cheroable very getting very uh 

Recording: (1480/ 9621) 
well i do think access is too easy but it is sort of like anything else i think if laws were passed the people who are against it would be so you know just besides themselves but it would i do not know for how long but i think it would make the situation not with the shootings and things like that but i think it would make the just the gun situation probably much worse for a while because people would be you know doing illegal things to get guns and that sort of thing but i mean too many people have guns here there is too much of a in my opinion you know there is too much of a gun culture i mean over there they have pretty much outlawed guns except for hunting and things and the fact that you know of course they are so supporting around but the fact that you can pretty much successfully do that obviously england is such a small country in comparison but i mean that is just amazing to me and but it is true i mean the fact that you know that access is just there is almost nothing but it and i mean just the amount of people that i just hear sort of yeah in conversation talking about oh yeah i you know getting a gun for security and all this stuff it is like you know your chances of number one needing it and number two if you were in that just minute percentage of you know happen chance that you would need it the fact that if you used it to shoot someone who was not you know i mean everything is against you 

Recording: (1481/ 9621) 
well i do not know it does not make sense 

Recording: (1482/ 9621) 
oh i will not tell her any 

Recording: (1483/ 9621) 
well you know my and my girls they are certain products that brand name i uh one of them i know is the mild uh pudding that you can uh take to for lunches which they do and it is like adventure you know adventure but adventure well every once in a while hunts will be the same price and they will be a coupon of the paper so joice will of joe is right we we trade she goes to go to the store once then next two weeks i go and the next two weeks she goes so uh she will you know she will buy stuff like that with a coupon she goes and i go why are you buying that and she goes it was cheaper than at my are brand and then when we eat it it is like it is too sweet you know or it is too overpowering or too sugary and the girls eat the same way they we do not like this it is too chocolatey so you know like the manwood stuff it is like they just pour sugar in it i guess because that is what people like and so i find that the un brand stuff well not on brand but it is all like an iron brand or something like that or food club or something like that 

Recording: (1484/ 9621) 
but so that what would you say to say it is a nice place to visit but you would not want to live there or would you actually live there 

Recording: (1485/ 9621) 
 well it okay when they um when that song came out you would probably hear it at least twelve times a day on some of those radio stations and it got so i just  i should not stand this i can not stand it 

Recording: (1486/ 9621) 
i do not know i would like to think i would like to say no sitting here but you never know because i guess that is that is what happens to a lot of them is they they come out of school all idealistic and then they go into industry and then they are molded and assuming they make upper management there is you want the tax breaks you want the thing you know what i mean and then the like i have in uncle he is a vice presidentson out on the wall street fromaryland she said you know he he got out of school he is very idealistic but now he he he is like all those people they should you know i i made it through myself and he is not for like the you know but realistically he did not but 

Recording: (1487/ 9621) 
thwhat 

Recording: (1488/ 9621) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (1489/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1490/ 9621) 
in uh ohio and then right on a touchy in fact ohio 

Recording: (1491/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1492/ 9621) 
oh i do not know it just seemed easier you know life was  i do not know it just was not the driving the main issue with month me you know the freeways we have here were not built for the amount of people that travel on them now i remember when they built seventy one north i remember when they built seventy east you know there were no freeways you know and i remember going up three fifteen when they first opened it and it was like nobody was on it you could just drive on it and it was like an empty road that nobody knew about yet and now it is like a parking lot everyday so it is just a lot of different stuff about you know that and i do not know it seems like you know activities to go do things everything is more crowded it you know my wife thinks this city is the eat out city you know everybody if you come anywhere at six thirty everybody in their brother is eating out all the time it seems like constantly we live near uh uh we live near millrun which is an area they have just built up in the last few years that just has like twenty restaurants and that that if you drive by any of those at five six oclock every lot is full of the room i do not care if it is tuesday thursday you know uh 

Recording: (1493/ 9621) 
yeah  or you could do the university of oregon it is a very nice very small university but it is nice 

Recording: (1494/ 9621) 
and we could do what we wanted  

Recording: (1495/ 9621) 
when i first you know got it to worse so it is been hard 

Recording: (1496/ 9621) 
that once you filter it through something it looks different but previous to it there is a lot there there is way too much shared experience to to gloss over effectively so when she said look if you are never listening to anything else that i say you will listen to this you need to go to europe i would like okay i will go to europe 

Recording: (1497/ 9621) 
goes i had a conversation with her band and said you know you did not cause anything you know i mean your motherinlaw is at home you if anything you wear the price upon to the whole yard so that is where you got to look yourself and you see that reflection in the mirror number of the you know 

Recording: (1498/ 9621) 
actually well it you know 

Recording: (1499/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (1500/ 9621) 
you are forceful personality too 

Recording: (1501/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (1502/ 9621) 
where northland is 

Recording: (1503/ 9621) 
oh it will be 

Recording: (1504/ 9621) 
no because uh all the kids take that california with california test on if you are familiar with that and it is like you know because it is seems like you and i go to school you go to you have got a double and i go to the worst school in columns and we both make straight a is well when you take the california achievement test that really that a is means nothing because it is like let us see what you understand and have learned the score on that is what really matters to me and both my daughters have really scored extremely high on those because you know they always pick on columbus public schools they go oh it so look how bad those ten scores well you know if you take say like uh the worst school in town which i do not know what it would be but let us just say it is uh brown school well you have children there who have not seen dad in probably ten years and mom is basically sometimes there or in prison so the live with grandma how do you expect them to do well nobody is there to you know i am not a uh you know i an over or anything but you know i always keep tabs on my kids you know like i have always gone to conference even though they have got straight a is i go to conferences and teachers go well what do you come for and i go if i do not come then it is like saying oh i do not really care so i always go so they know that i am keeping tabs on things and i do not demand a is i just demand them to do their best and i said you know if your best is the same and that is what it will be but i said if your best is an age getting to see you get me to talk to you so uh back to the brown school uh there are kids like my daughter there who make straight a is and when they take the uh what is that thing the efficiency test is doing through it and get like outstanding on it and uh then you have uh this probably sounds really biased or bigged in budget then you have the kid who is mom and dad are not together and and he comes to school maybe twice a week and when he takes a profession test he gets like a 

Recording: (1505/ 9621) 
like i had my kids last week i had them all right how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and then i had them one by one come up to the table in the front they did not know i was going to do this so after they got it all done i go out and i get my little bag of stuff and i bring in my bread my peanut butter and my jelly and i sit them down beside me and i go okay now no ad living no adding no taking away reading exactly what you wrote 

Recording: (1506/ 9621) 
and then the other coaches did either 

Recording: (1507/ 9621) 
 you played saxophone in the band 

Recording: (1508/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (1509/ 9621) 
they are pretty much all underground things they have a web page up i am not sure what the address is right now 

Recording: (1510/ 9621) 
i mean my my kids went to a school that uh when my son was already left to but in the fourth grade they then they took all the kids in the other direction and said we are closing next year and it was hard but yeah once it is reached the point that decision is made and announced and and there were good reasons for it um in to explain the reasons and you know at some point you have you have to figure out how much do you want to fight something when it is inevitable 

Recording: (1511/ 9621) 
the most neatest the old 

Recording: (1512/ 9621) 
every kid in my kid ran around with i knew these parents one way or another 

Recording: (1513/ 9621) 
you do not have too many options you know 

Recording: (1514/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1515/ 9621) 
because the larger story was two hours to film in one one movie but this one as a as a part of a hole i i am deserving complete judgement until 

Recording: (1516/ 9621) 
oh okay 

Recording: (1517/ 9621) 
as uh a lot of mothers do but she was there and if they needed her for anything or needed her they would say no to something  you know as they are are moreand in fact that our kids knew what our moral beliefs or 

Recording: (1518/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1519/ 9621) 
she is already i did not mean she is having it in the other way 

Recording: (1520/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1521/ 9621) 
oh last these one of them yes along that line 

Recording: (1522/ 9621) 
they do not pay means to be fun 

Recording: (1523/ 9621) 
so you have nothing we get for kids nowadays 

Recording: (1524/ 9621) 
yeah it is like um i do not know they used to have something called the sporting post that was directly related and then um ad is kind of took over for that like in still in boy scouts and then explain went off on its own and as a result they took religion out of the program and they put they allow like homosexuality with uh liters and all that so it is i do not know we call it like hippie voiceouts 

Recording: (1525/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1526/ 9621) 
and we pick out of those because otherwise your kids going to hate you 

Recording: (1527/ 9621) 
we had uh counter battery fire we called it which when they were shooting back at us once in north africa was kind of scary uh we were in positions where we could fire on a a uh tank battle that was going on we had a four four word observer up there where he could look down and see the whole thing and so he was adjusting fire and i do not know how many tanks they claim that we had but 

Recording: (1528/ 9621) 
and so it was kind of funny but but they discouraging i mean it was discouraging when you see people that do not have any hope and 

Recording: (1529/ 9621) 
the callabes 

Recording: (1530/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (1531/ 9621)

Recording: (1538/ 9621) 
you said we are they are government to run government stays out of things that is our problem government is in too too many things they need to be out of your nose that is your personal business they need to be out of your business 

Recording: (1539/ 9621) 
i would just it is sad even here in climates you know like two weeks ago when they had these bond scares in different high school and i thought you know i just you know it is just because because of all the things that you have seen in the world in the last year that these kids want to do that is just to see what is going to happen 

Recording: (1540/ 9621) 
now what that is it does to your new atlantaes or something like that well think about now you have got the flat lands down there you know where our kids are going to go 

Recording: (1541/ 9621) 
tiger fall 

Recording: (1542/ 9621) 
okay i was born in dayton ohio uh lived there almost thirty five years before moving to columbus in nineteen eighty one uh lived in uh northwest climus for eighteen years uh moved last january a little farther it is about five miles further west near hill yard but still living in the city of columbus uh so i have been here about eighteen nineteen years i like columbus also i think it is a great city although the last three months i have threatened to move on more than one occasion because of all the traffic congestion and all of the road construction you just can not get anywhere it is very frustrating uh but other than that columbus is a great city um i went to this is something different about me most people do not know that uh it it existed in the the twentieth century but i went to an all girl catholic school for twelve years uh so they were they are new boys and i was not in a classroom with boys till i got to college uh i went to college at right state university um my parents could afford to send me so i had to work two years in high school two years after high school to pay my way through college um taught school for about eight and a half nine years and during that time got my master is degree in remedial reading um taught four i think i said it was about eight and a half nine years and my life and career took a whole different turn and became president of my teachers association or teachers union and that lead to a job in political action because i would always been active in politics from high school on uh the first campaign i worked in was for john kennedy in nineteen sixty as a freshman in high school and continued working in campaigns in a volunteer status uh several different campaigns in ohio and in dayton where i came from uh but moved to columbus to take a job as a political action consultant for the largest public employee union did that for a couple of years till i went out in the field and associated labor contracts um did that that is kind of stressful um so i decided to strike off on my own and try some public relations and marketing and did that and um i am never been married did not plan that that was not a goal in life it just never occurred uh so i have no kids but i have a pet and now i am uh i call myself semiret i get a small you know monthly retirement and then i supplement my income by doing things like this i am an independent contractor i do training i do um different things you know where people get my opinion i have done a couple of um things with uh lawyers looking you know they do like msureals on real issues and then you listen to all of this stuff and then you you pretend that your a jury can come up with a decision and i guess they use it in forming their case into going into court so that is fun so that is a little bit about me i would say my family my mom and dad um well i am um my mother was first generation american my grandparents came to this country from hungry and that was a neat experience i like growing up talking to my grandfather about what life was like as a peasant in hungry uh and he thought this is the greatest country in the world in that rub off on me i still do also he always voted so you know i learned at an early age that it is important to vote uh my mom and dad were both alcoholics um i have two brothers and no sisters one older than me one younger than me um and i have no children but i have a pet that is my child and i always say pets are uh children you raise pets you spoil so my my pet is very spoiled 

Recording: (1543/ 9621) 
he went to cloma schools uh and the kid did not really and he just found laying around his his father is car in the club compartment brought it in to show to the other kids uh that was very upsetting to my son he is very sensitive uh he used to be  again i do not know if that is normal for teenagers or not but he used used to be very sensitive to other people but uh i do not think i i do not know if he is or he just does not will not let him beat so speed right now but 

Recording: (1544/ 9621) 
that is funny 

Recording: (1545/ 9621) 
they have to get a larger police department to do that that is another thing the cities have grown so much and we do not have adequate protection i do not think anymore than they 

Recording: (1546/ 9621) 
 it does not work out 

Recording: (1547/ 9621) 
i have been back there for about ten ten years i would like to move back down there but there just is not any work you know unless you own your own company so that basically is a remodeled enjoyable and stuff like that 

Recording: (1548/ 9621) 
yeah that was the most somebody could be um order to pay being unemployed 

Recording: (1549/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (1550/ 9621) 
yeah it basically feeds itself in that manner rather than high taxes but enormouslyantly high i mean it it is a little higher but you know it it is not ridiculously high 

Recording: (1551/ 9621) 
they going to lock me up 

Recording: (1552/ 9621) 
huh 

Recording: (1553/ 9621)

Recording: (1555/ 9621) 
you can see the housing trends and they are they are again that goes back to the stupid consumer i say stupid consumer because when i was in college i always said well the consumer has the fourth grade education level 

Recording: (1556/ 9621) 
just for the courses that i need  

Recording: (1557/ 9621)

Recording: (1562/ 9621) 
yeah i just like doing it and i have a good i my my best friend is a realtor of course she is since retired but it is so funny because she would always go see all these statistics and this and that because the to stuff i have done is in and and because i live in area and so she would say oh i do not know and she would say well how much do you have to get it for and how much do you and i would say oh i do not know i think if i get it for under a hundred five i would probably can tell up for a hundred and forty if i would this is not it you are you are still looking going to make me eat ten thousand dollars profit but uh and she would say well i do not know for a long time she was always real skepticalical because i would just like make up these numbers or just have this idea and finally she says i am all very i do not know it always works out for you you always get that so just do it and it just some he tooish kind of thing 

Recording: (1563/ 9621) 
like it is like we are taking catalogs over the phone and it is not uh really a big deal they like they are not seeing how we are dressed at all i mean they tell us which is where college shirts and stuff but nobody does like they do not really enforce it and they too they on it like nice like for hungging or whatever like that just the only thing that from professional attitude like i do not even know what to say i hate to people like that like this is like such a different like 

Recording: (1564/ 9621) 
boy 

Recording: (1565/ 9621) 
i think that would be true 

Recording: (1566/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (1567/ 9621) 
i i used to kind of worry about the effect that tv had on me um i when i was little i used to watch a lot of tv i would come home from school and plant myself in front of the tv and watch uh like you know four cartoons back to back or so every day after school or i that kind of thing and then saturday morning it would be a a block of you know from six in the morning until afternoon or something these days i do not watch nearly that much tv um i do not buy these arguments that people make that say that like children are like the violence in tv is affecting children i mean i i have seen some evidence of of exercises where in schools they kids will watch a like a a cartoon like uh like road runner or something and then be a little roughing but i i do not think that it it goes into like values i do not associate like rising crime or something with uh like crime on tv or something i mean if there is a correlation i mean uh the more of the you know like parents have a greater influence on the children than tv ever could i mean i watched a lot of tv but i feel that my parents taught me was right in wrong and they watched a lot of rather violent tv violent movies all that kind of thing and uh 

Recording: (1568/ 9621) 
i remember mcgee lane i do not know if you know who they are yeah 

Recording: (1569/ 9621)

gun somewhere else 

Recording: (1606/ 9621) 
uhhuh and that is what i like about it is the ambyens and uh the river and uh oh oh and departments are just very very plain and but uh 

Recording: (1607/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1608/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1609/ 9621) 
okay well i am not really from columbus either i have been here for a little over a year now my husband went to high school here and had a daughter while he was in high school so after he finished college he wanted to be located here and we kind of live between in worthinton and west drove uh kind of north columbus and i like it a lot 

Recording: (1610/ 9621) 
no it is very much so 

Recording: (1611/ 9621) 
being highly critical of of organized religion 

Recording: (1612/ 9621) 
none of i mean it is kind of a traditional light at the uh like a big channel was up bright light at the end or they were floating above themselves looking down at themselves at the accident scene uh seeing a dead rowsomething like that 

Recording: (1613/ 9621) 
bet she is doing fine uh she was dating somebody i do not whether they really got married or not you know because i do not really have a much communication with her some guy younger than her i talked to him he seemed like pretty some day yeah 

Recording: (1614/ 9621) 
course my wife is worked in higher education for thirty years so 

Recording: (1615/ 9621) 
she could not understand the fact that you could just disagree with her it had to be because she was black or she was an older woman or you could not just disagree had to be a reason there but fortunately she she used to me that in front of my boss who was black who did not believe it he knew better so 

Recording: (1616/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (1617/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (1618/ 9621) 
yeah they were they were trouble kids in the past they came up the background they did 

Recording: (1619/ 9621) 
until they start getting a little bit better equipment because the equipment is really ancient i mean there is stuff there that is older than i am you know so but they like uh poor companies getting a new tower and they are it is supposed to be done about three and a half years and the equipment they are getting is all brand new stuff it is not like they are taking all the old junk we have got and moving it over there so you know that will help and and nationwide they are also putting new stuff in but the bad part is is uh picture your father is your father computer literate okay he is he is at his job and tomorrow morning they come in and they go everybody is going to put all their work on computer well 

Recording: (1620/ 9621) 
um no actually now i live in hillier 

Recording: (1621/ 9621) 
for alcohol like on your breath at all 

Recording: (1622/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1623/ 9621) 
because the problem with guns in my opinion is you do not have to thank to use it it takes you know you do not have to sit there and load it and in a split second i think we all are capable of shooting somebody for whatever reason you know just dependity or what not just in a split second you know we we might have that once in life but we can kill somebody that quickly and you can not go oh you know 

Recording: (1624/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1625/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1626/ 9621) 
relations but they are normal people outside of their homosexuality i mean it is nothing different than regular parents 

Recording: (1627/ 9621) 
because they have got beaches and and yeah  yeah maybe it is like i do not think lake edging can compare  i would heard 

Recording: (1628/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (1629/ 9621) 
to uh 

Recording: (1630/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (1631/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1632/ 9621) 
okay it does not have like the equalized are thingy 

Recording: (1633/ 9621) 
well i think i am trying to stay on to it maybe i am devating too much  

Recording: (1634/ 9621) 
now if you are not the kids 

Recording: (1635/ 9621) 
to the art and take department 

Recording: (1636/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1637/ 9621) 
you know and when i came back here i had moved uh to kentucky i came back here uh i would say about nineteen seventy three 

Recording: (1638/ 9621) 
well i think in general like let us say if you took a handful of executives from bordan or at&t or someplace like that you would probably find that in general they are very concerned 

Recording: (1639/ 9621) 
i do not like bought things so i just do not um i think it is it is kind of like you get what you pay for 

Recording: (1640/ 9621) 
yeah but uh just to see the church might be fun uh we about how many years ago seven or eight years ago decided to build a new wood ship center buildingyeah because we were really too too big for the thinxia that we had 

Recording: (1641/ 9621) 
hum 

Recording: (1642/ 9621) 
well yeah me either 

Recording: (1643/ 9621) 
so that is a little bit required i am taking some extra anyway because i like it 

Recording: (1644/ 9621) 
enough to satisfy me so that was good 

Recording: (1645/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1646/ 9621) 
no it would not bother me though 

Recording: (1647/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1648/ 9621) 
so i spend the best of the money for the money so i spend it in the best of the money so they are 

Recording: (1649/ 9621) 
umhum yeah i you know all i said i do not know i i just i have got to make some decisions here you know and i do not want to put too much pressure on it you know one of the others told me hey you know call yourself so slack and just and relaxed for a while you know because i worked at a movie theater for a year and you know i got hassled by my hair you know uh told me the only thing keeping me from moving up in the company was a pair of scissors 

Recording: (1650/ 9621) 
see now the nice things just every where i could not believe it but now it is it is easy to take it for granted again just going back home  

Recording: (1651/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (1652/ 9621) 
oh you have so it is like i mean i it is like i heard about that that is not even worth going to be food 

Recording: (1653/ 9621) 
well i think at that age parents should be involved and hopefully they will be up in line enough to know that this is going to be something she is going to have the rest of her life um i will tell you what with today is world and some of these fourteen year olds they that look like they are twenty and you know they they know what they are doing and know they should not keep repeating that um i just think the most important thing is just for them to be able to have the option i really do but yes the parents should be involved i would say to the age seventeen they you know i think they should have a parents consent hopefully the parents will love their daughter enough to realize when it mistake it is going to be she is going to be a young mother and then eventually maybe they do not even want to be a mother you know i mean there is a lot of girls that have those babies and then they just they kill them you know and there is so much of that for a while there that was going on and it was like he i can not believe these women are doing this you know they just snap  

Recording: (1654/ 9621) 
but i i had a noinin before i had the hard attack i would already had two heart attacks i had a noin that i needed to be on the first shift or i would probably have another heart attack and they would not put me on first shift then i had another heart attack put me to high school then i had another heart attack when i was in the hospital and when i came out that is when i gave them another no state and i needed really the on first shift 

Recording: (1655/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1656/ 9621) 
and we called it uh the talking hall because they supposed a bunch of the information into that or a bunch of the money 

Recording: (1657/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1658/ 9621) 
oh oh yeah look at you man  

Recording: (1659/ 9621) 
well that is an interesting thing i am not in geology  i uh i am actually making more money right now in music than i am in geology but i am making most of my money in something that is that has nothing to do with any of my studies um yes i i play uh i am also in a number of volunteer choirs uh the choir at the first unitaryian universalist church in and uh a small choir where i work which i got the opportunity to conduct today because the conductor was the conductor was uh not at work so uh i i do a lot of music in my spare time mostly uh but uh unfortunately i did not get a job in geology and i i do not have a full full time job in music either and either one of those would be nice but i b  

Recording: (1660/ 9621) 
uh i remember uh you know we would like go to a pool hall or something you know bar actually you know they would be uh but we would play pool you know they would not let us drink or something because we were under age but uh you know it was basically the guys you know and the girls would go over to somebody is house you know and then we would need up later on you know and go our separate way or we would drive into back then you know and we would use a a movie and so uh as far as going to shopping that was not really something that was a big of a thing i was maybe his saturday thing with mom and dad you know because they had the money you know so um 

Recording: (1661/ 9621) 
you know i do love the kids i love you know you know and and i guess it is true and i have always wondered you know i turned eighteen and i thought but should not i feel like an adult now you know that is twenty one should not i start to feel like the three five to the twenty five you know and i wonder at what point do you really feel like your you are on that other side or you are one of the grown up people instead of one of the little people i maybe maybe that is maybe that is one i mean 

Recording: (1662/ 9621) 
you know just experiencing someone for who they are and so she is 

Recording: (1663/ 9621) 
wow 

Recording: (1664/ 9621) 
yeah hard to be cut though 

Recording: (1665/ 9621) 
i picked um legal secretary also but i chose the law enforcement over that because i got a substitute of that too 

Recording: (1666/ 9621) 
i mean now 

Recording: (1667/ 9621) 
they are trying it just does not seem like they are thinking ahead 

Recording: (1668/ 9621) 
as a result like their kids my age and stuff like that that i talked to them and they have no idea what is going on 

Recording: (1669/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (1670/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1671/ 9621) 
yeah exactly 

Recording: (1672/ 9621) 
okay  

Recording: (1673/ 9621) 
yeah they do not know about it but then you know they like you said they do not wanna see it 

Recording: (1674/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1675/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1676/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (1677/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1678/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1679/ 9621) 
where did you do the aerobics 

Recording: (1680/ 9621) 
you know so i think maybe not universal health care but for children i think it would be helpful 

Recording: (1681/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1682/ 9621) 
that is funny 

Recording: (1683/ 9621) 
yeah i mean i i think that the stories have not been it i i mean i am some of my favorite like lines from the simpsons or where they are highly critical i one of my favorites is uh when bart the one with where simpson loses loses is sold which in some ways it is kind of pretty gee um because at least it takes other positions like you know whether the sold is is real it does not matter but uh but uh uh but i love what one scene whether cleaning out the uh well part of them do not house they are being punished they are cleaning out the pipes of the oregon is and the the pipes of the oregon and uh parts like there is no such thing as the salt you know i was just like why would they light it was what would they have to gain and then they it cuts to uh river from wherever and love joy empty the uh uh oh one of the the the tip jars the the a donation thing into a little change counting machine like on my was not like i do not hear cleaning  what would they have to gain  um 

Recording: (1684/ 9621) 
definitely and it really makes your way of your own mentality i mean things you see every day i mean you never know i could happen to anybody any time just like that accident yesterday with um right 

Recording: (1685/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (1686/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (1687/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (1688/ 9621) 
kids 

Recording: (1689/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (1690/ 9621) 
she wants to go to columbus state uh wants to get into one of their engineering tech programs uh umhum and i i hope she does but she is had to be responsible for herself for her whole life um 

Recording: (1691/ 9621) 
my family yeah see them face to face you know recognize them and they recognize me but something transferred then because as i look at them  of course as i called you said when they are on earth my goodness we are taught to learn the most negative thing about a person so i called you said if you see a blank sheet of paper you see a dot on the thing you do not see the ninety nine percent of the paper you see that dot it is gonna be just the opposite they have a i can not think of a negative thing about you and the reason why you can not think of a negative thing about them because you see price appearance coming through that 

Recording: (1692/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1693/ 9621) 
i do not i do not  

Recording: (1694/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1695/ 9621) 
oh not an immediate family going back like you did there i know there there is a murderer in our family uh oh there have been horse thieves uh i am going on back now i am not think in terms of the current family but basically what i was going to want to go is current families somewhat current 

Recording: (1696/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1697/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1698/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (1699/ 9621) 
i guess i almost that i wish they would celebration every holiday so then they are exposed to all of it instead of none of it 

Recording: (1700/ 9621) 
i went to one day and ate my lunch all the time for two weeks and they paid me ten dollars a day 

Recording: (1701/ 9621) 
less fortunate out there and that there is little things we can do 

Recording: (1702/ 9621) 
yeah and yet so i 

Recording: (1703/ 9621) 
and then i have such i mean i i do not know i have it like my sister she is cooking every day 

Recording: (1704/ 9621) 
what 

Recording: (1705/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (1706/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1707/ 9621) 
just changing the language 

Recording: (1708/ 9621) 
um there were people i met through friends um actually been one of my friends parents had a friend that was gay uh and then just be over there or whatever and i can not stay in any big difference between 

Recording: (1709/ 9621) 
they can not see nothing wrong with that 

Recording: (1710/ 9621) 
yeah it was just like there was a lot of people there who you know like their parents were farmers and or they they were whatever you know it was like like parakeet puppy kids or like hickory type kids you know who 

Recording: (1711/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (1712/ 9621)

Recording: (1713/ 9621) 
how many people want that 

Recording: (1714/ 9621) 
wow 

Recording: (1715/ 9621) 
um you have to take a foundation of courses 

Recording: (1716/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (1717/ 9621) 
exactly um i think that would deter people um you get one strike and you are like oh um maybe i better clean up my act here 

Recording: (1718/ 9621) 
and none of the animals they profile were pets i mean a thirty six foot long python on what the house a person doing with that as a pet and they should not be allowed to and then people is treating above flow like they could stand next to it and take a family picture 

Recording: (1719/ 9621) 
you either accept it or you do not i mean you know 

Recording: (1720/ 9621) 
um it was pretty far  the city actually had a million people that i lived in most of the time but it was the government that ran it actually was still um communist

Recording: (1726/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1727/ 9621) 
you know what kind of an answer is that even if your answer is i do not know why you can not do it it just makes me uncomfortable you know that is a lot more fair than because i am the boss of the or something like that and i think if you raise back to our heads and and just kind of sit down here is what them you know kind of try to be i do not know that is the way that is the way my family is always been and it always seems to work really well for us 

Recording: (1728/ 9621) 
well it is good now uh while the weather again has changed that there is computers have made a big difference uh it is more exciting now for people who are in that area uh they are interested in it is more emphasis on information not books and things that go into the library to get any information 

Recording: (1729/ 9621)

Recording: (1751/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (1752/ 9621)

Recording: (1753/ 9621) 
ooh boy like action oh bite the bad guys yeah and now it is uh you know like looking and sort of postulatingating deeper meaning to what the characters have to go through using elements of the story is not medical for it for things in real life uh and in fact that it was something that did have such an effect on me as a as a child and upon our culture i think it is kind of interesting and now that it is coming back out uh i mean it look at things from a little different perspective but i mean you know of the maybe i think i have done about ten twelve painting of which i am considered to be done in in like 

Recording: (1754/ 9621) 
and i do not know that is quite that bad  but it was certainly some things that he is been doing that are not i have proved up and i am not real up on that 

Recording: (1755/ 9621)

but you can also you can also grow with respect you can work with a community and still gain your respect from community and you will have religions but you know nowadays we do not have a lot of play on the way is out the window and that is why if you are the most you are saying the other day hey yeah you are a big deal you are going out the way you are not well maybe some people are not little cause they do not want service okay no disposable that is a problem we have in our society today because of one thing we are trying to communicate as you say through the internet and to businesses but we do not have compassion and we do not have commitment without those three you will never have success 

Recording: (1787/ 9621) 
i know uh 

Recording: (1788/ 9621)

Recording: (1796/ 9621) 
then would be with the black president and i think it would cause problems um i do not know if anything real violent or anything would occur from it but i definitely could see here definitely would think that people would be arguing about it yelling about it and making a bigger deal about it 

Recording: (1797/ 9621) 
is that right 

Recording: (1798/ 9621) 
oh because i have been in public schools all my life and i should be first to know that there is uh a lot of favorism you know some some teachers will teach one but not teach the other

Recording: (1808/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (1809/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1810/ 9621) 
the six normal kids because ld kids would be creative and they would think of ways to get out of there and the normal kids would sit and cry 

Recording: (1811/ 9621)

Recording: (1822/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1823/ 9621) 
i am hoping that will be the same experience as it is in the high state 

Recording: (1824/ 9621) 
uh which one are you talking 

Recording: (1825/ 9621) 
you know when i just fight i just do not i just do not like this it is not because it is something that when i look long term is the something that i want to do much for the rest of my life and i said no interest in it you know and i think that you have to look at and see if you are compatible at somebody before you know people get into situations and they marry people that you just you from the outside you can look at and you can think i can that is you know that is never going to work  you know so they think that you are you compatible do you really feel like this is something that is going to that is going to work and be positiveyeah i do not i do not know have to do anything 

Recording: (1826/ 9621) 
so it is probably was not unexpected we just were not prepared for it i do not think you could be prepared for it 

Recording: (1827/ 9621)

Recording: (1845/ 9621) 
yeah i some of them just look like you know cracker back box houses that you know they have put up in a week or something they have amazing how you can drive by and then in two weeks drive by and there is fifty homes because there is a lot of growth in hill here in hill here it is that is starting to scare us actually a little bit because now they just build another whole high school so two whole high schools i think they were up to two or three thousand senior graduates last year 

Recording: (1846/ 9621) 
and that was strictly no no 

Recording: (1847/ 9621) 
it was more fun without being on 

Recording: (1848/ 9621) 
um then when you start to talk about homosexuality it would be easier to uh it would be easier for the kids to to see that they are just people you know 

Recording: (1849/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (1850/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (1851/ 9621)

Recording: (1852/ 9621) 
i had french in the sixth grade and i got a i had um german and spanish in the seventh grade and then in the uh eighth grade i had french in the ninth grade i get uh the ninth grade ahead french the tenth grade ahead of french and major year of high school i had french and my work grades went bees straight piece c is straight c is d is straight d is and i said i think i should get out now and i started taking i did not even take french my senior year but then the you are from science and science came around and said you will not have that for anything would you are going and i said well i do not know this french and i was going to take some more french and a first year freshman year of french and that was not fun my second year sophomore started in for another year of french and but three of course away through the year i realized that every day it was all about draininging french class before and after i would spend all up to french class going no no french class and all after french law is going oh there was so good it was like this is stupid this is no way to live my life so i went to my house and i said no french class that is how it is going to be so you need to figure out how i am not going to end up taking for it we had to take french fries you had to i was like you know do not have to take french quite 

Recording: (1853/ 9621) 
right like magazines 

Recording: (1854/ 9621) 
i was that right then i interested in you know seeing seeing the sights or seeing well maybe they are but i was like that as as a as a as a you know as a secondary agent uh 

Recording: (1855/ 9621) 
our our janitor is worthless um basically um we were complaining about it like earlier during the year three complaints uh formal complaints been file against him and he still ever used to change the beach water lake more than once a week so we had these times come in one day and it was we went in like in shock it was so clean 

Recording: (1856/ 9621) 
you know i have a friend of music graduated from uh purdue university of indiana or something like that i think that is where it was i said pey pey university yeah 

Recording: (1857/ 9621) 
but since all the moms have gone to work and let the tv become the electronic babysitter and the other thing that is happening is kids do not know things now that you would expect them to know like because their moms are not reading to them like they do not know who any of the who is 

Recording: (1858/ 9621) 
and i was glad i realized that nobody would ever mess with my children not even their father my husband or whatever 

Recording: (1859/ 9621) 
everybody gets something 

Recording: (1860/ 9621) 
were for me 

Recording: (1861/ 9621) 
yeah and they are also talking about because uh uh the actors the reason they are ending it is because the actors do not want to do it there was talk i do not know if they are still pursuing this that they would have new characters take over the roles and i mean the character development is the most important part i think uh so i think that will be a failure but that also sort of tells me that they are getting these things kind of open 

Recording: (1862/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1863/ 9621) 
oh okay okay uh yeah as far as the siblings go bernie is uh does terrible work

Recording: (1919/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1920/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1921/ 9621) 
to put into it 

Recording: (1922/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1923/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1924/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (1925/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1926/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1927/ 9621)

Recording: (1928/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1929/ 9621) 
so uh cole man you know he had a good uh record 

Recording: (1930/ 9621) 
not 

Recording: (1931/ 9621) 
yeah exactly that will solve the problem 

Recording: (1932/ 9621) 
well one one would hope that there would be enough uh education on the subject that the kids would not think it was that odd 

Recording: (1933/ 9621) 
there was pregnant girls in middle school 

Recording: (1934/ 9621) 
then when we eat to the eyes are itching and 

Recording: (1935/ 9621)

Recording: (1937/ 9621) 
and the real meaning behind it so 

Recording: (1938/ 9621) 
it is not that bad because a lot of times it is just busy for a while and then it is like not busy at later at night um so then i can just talk because we sit right next to each other so it is a that is good that is 

Recording: (1939/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1940/ 9621) 
no  

Recording: (1941/ 9621) 
 they are definitely i thought they would be a lot better they they picked updang left and then on top of it they were good without them and now they pick them up and they seem to be doing it they still struggling i am like i do not understand that i put the indians at horrible right now i like i watched the game yesterday and there was i think there were a few days ago seven half games back from the chicago white sox we watched the game yesterday and uh i do not know if we had a lot of injuries or anything because i do not really follow the indians but the uh the i can even recognize the name of the names 

Recording: (1942/ 9621) 
and this is my consent so what you use that  yeah 

Recording: (1943/ 9621) 
she is she is adorable how old is she in this picture 

Recording: (1944/ 9621) 
see people now all of a sudden there is a rash of fires you read that and these people keep doing it i think society as a whole has gotten a lot more of our own which made the kids more of our own 

Recording: (1945/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (1946/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (1947/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1948/ 9621) 
we uh they they have a dress draft notice at the second time so i got a draft notice of it unless it um yeah 

Recording: (1949/ 9621)

i have to get a job and supporting myself so 

Recording: (1955/ 9621) 
five years 

Recording: (1956/ 9621) 
so it brings that down and it is like you know they are they are not comparing it fairly if you would take all the people who are making the same score on the tests at both schools i betcha they are all about the same 

Recording: (1957/ 9621) 
yeah it is it 

Recording: (1958/ 9621)

Recording: (1959/ 9621) 
predomably i like i like playing uh i like puzzles i like challengeers i do not like jigsy puzzles uh i like anything to the boss fixing it i do not mind breaking things either because then you have something to think of course it made me a very bad logical job 

Recording: (1960/ 9621) 
well he was not really recognized then until just the last couple of years and part of the problem was it was fairly new and everybody was being dupon state of hd and it was not really they were really good screening instruments for now they are not right now uh and we have often felt that he needed to have gifted emphasis for gifted children because uh and the uh schools would not do that for me because his grades were not good enough because he did not do the work

Recording: (1964/ 9621) 
okay tripping to 

Recording: (1965/ 9621) 
they are doing different things like different people in the program but i kind of decided i would take the easy room

Recording: (1991/ 9621) 
but it and it is it is parents that fight for the society and what is in your community you know the parents for each individual child they have to all form together as a group and almost be all parents to all these kids as a group you know it is not you can be the best parent in the world at home and then your kid goes to school in his access to the computer or they get in a group of kids where they are parents they do not even know where they are you know as the kids responsibility to get them to go to school you know maybe the mom and dad did not even come home the night before but you know i mean there is all different kinds of situations and i think it does start with parents because they need to be aware of what all the kids are being um shown and and have access to 

Recording: (1992/ 9621)

yeah 

Recording: (1999/ 9621) 
yeah yeah they they all all of them there is actually other systems too and they all have pretty much the same book but it is just that there is little details that are different and 

Recording: (2000/ 9621) 
oh  

Recording: (2001/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (2002/ 9621) 
i would say of uh i think the the the bb a generally sees on the average five seven ten something like that a day and not all of them almost 

Recording: (2003/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2004/ 9621) 
um i think i think that there should be a mandatory because you have it in big companies you have mandatory uh sexualnate in in you learn you teach the girls that it is not what they do is how they make you feel as as instituted as you are uh uh harassment there and they are too afraid and then besides that they you know there is crashes on you know you can not fault the girls for having crashes and things like that they are going through enough things as it is 

Recording: (2005/ 9621) 
almost the minority it was a pretty even it is a very it is a low income neighborhood and when i was in seventh grade i remember going home and saying with everybody that is same and being total of course they are so i went to school until everybody i was in the with danny flowers who happen to be black and i got called into the office and they called me social worker and they to my was punished i was not allowed to uh i was grounded for the year and they never called this kid in i i then i thought this whole thing is not going to let me you know what what is wrong with these people they kept saying that they wanted to save this nice white girl because i had so much potential and uh they were not going to let me throw me from my life away like this well i was you know it was bizarre and so i was always from that to my mind i decided these these people are all crazy i am never going to i am never going to do like that and so i have a whole lot of different values from my family and it is real hard for them because all my other siblings who are younger are willing to 

Recording: (2006/ 9621) 
oh that is nice 

Recording: (2007/ 9621) 
oh yeah yeah 

Recording: (2008/ 9621) 
yes it is definitely having effect on uh children and uh uh the schools are trying to catch up or make up for it but they are not doing it yet whether they will be able to pick up enough uh by changing the way they teach and so on in the next twenty years i do not know but uh i am glad my children went to school when they did  and i stayed home with them 

Recording: (2009/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (2010/ 9621) 
umhum yeah yeah if it is nice day on the weekends i 

Recording: (2011/ 9621) 
check this out and then he will let go and fall on his butt  it is kind of funny 

Recording: (2012/ 9621) 
yeah there is like people calling and talk about other like they saw it in this other our mail order catalog that i have never heard of either it is i do not know how really they do it like it is just like they get people is names and stuff from credit card companies and then mail them out things and if people call back or whatever 

Recording: (2013/ 9621) 
somewhat 

Recording: (2014/ 9621) 
like you know 

Recording: (2015/ 9621) 
yeah it it wrong right 

Recording: (2016/ 9621) 
yeah  

Recording: (2017/ 9621) 
when his background really was 

Recording: (2018/ 9621) 
yeah graduate math in high school uh and road in the oh year for uh the one or quarter and pursue a party that uh and at the time 

Recording: (2019/ 9621) 
yeah it was very hard for me to stay in school i could have easily quit like that because the teachers did not i went to a college public school and it they did not care i mean i i went through elementary and middle school with straight a is and b is and got there and all of his on the seats to eat you know and that just was really the teachers did not care you know if you learn you learn if you do not you do not if you do not come to school you do not they do not care that was how my school was so i do not there was i do not there was nothing there that really i can remember that did anything good for me i mean i think middle school taught me a lot more than high school 

Recording: (2020/ 9621) 
they are not as many of them or you mean because 

Recording: (2021/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (2022/ 9621) 
and she is taking very good care of herself she is following all the doctors uh orders and she is very careful what she eats and 

Recording: (2023/ 9621) 
um um 

Recording: (2024/ 9621) 
uh i live up north uh around carolina and uh more so road 

Recording: (2025/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2026/ 9621) 
but it is not going to work i mean they if you are around people i mean number one they are around their parents and their siblings and that socialization you go to church or to the library or whatever i mean you are around people and you are around children and they get to have socialization if you wanna call it whatever and i think from everything that i have read and seen that um they get the socialization that they need at home and they are not relying so much on their peers and their poor is opinions because i i for one example the poorie man craze my son did not know what pokey month was until he heard some other kids talking about it and you know it is just like stuff like that it is just like they do not they do not know what half of that stuff is unless some other kid is pushing it in their face you know and then even still they are just like oh it is cool because everybody else likes it they do not really know what it is or what it is about or i mean you know what i mean because it is like they they just blow up each other or whatever it is like really what is the point to the whole thing and he did not know what it was until he heard some other kids talking about oh he must be cool because some other kids are talking about it but then he decided that it was not cold so that was my influence our influence on him rather than the pure his influence on him 

Recording: (2027/ 9621) 
great brother in christian middle school in some part of worthinton schools because they act it 

Recording: (2028/ 9621) 
um i get a bs that is they mail to me after first year of medical school they they figure that uh grossin enemy and all that is enough 

Recording: (2029/ 9621) 
yeah that seems good 

Recording: (2030/ 9621) 
umhum yeah 

Recording: (2031/ 9621) 
oh i do not know you know 

Recording: (2032/ 9621) 
he seems confused parenting with controlling 

Recording: (2033/ 9621) 
so i am lucky to get too much of an attitude from people 

Recording: (2034/ 9621) 
i think it is important to know what the person is values and customers are into support whatever it is and then i mean we have done some wild things over there but i mean it is i mean we have changed rooms around beds around positions of how would need it to be placed in order they needed uh they would either start or they needed to have this thing above the better under the bed and they mean if it is important for them to have prayer then i think it is important to get the appropriate people over and encourage them to have whatever it is they need 

Recording: (2035/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (2036/ 9621) 
and i do not really think it is something that needs to be taught um the only thing probably is like what do they call that uh cultural diversity or whatever classes they have is take i think but that i do not think is such a bad idea uh because just because you grew up in i do not know what i grew up in but i will i will give you an example i did not grew up in let us say somebody that goes hunting and fishing and drives tracks and wears ball caps and listens country music does not mean if somebody does not do that they are not okay i think that would be a good idea or you know cultures are different so if you wanted to view that as a culture or you know what they mean that that is something to a friend um except the people you know how to like what they are doing but they are still people so 

Recording: (2037/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (2038/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (2039/ 9621) 
do you see i have not heard it all about i do not even drive 

Recording: (2040/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (2041/ 9621) 
and i would just hear things 

Recording: (2042/ 9621) 
well i do not i do not think it is really alternative 

Recording: (2043/ 9621) 
she was all edging that students were writing a racial slurs on their desks and stuff but i had friends in classes of hers and none of them wrote any 

Recording: (2044/ 9621) 
nice figure they will be plenty of time if you had to be in my major is on green jail you  they gonna make me snack  so 

Recording: (2045/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2046/ 9621) 
and you you could actually walk out and take a picture of it over there now for a columbish you could not do that the much you could over there because you could walk around on the ramp over there and that always you 

Recording: (2047/ 9621) 
yeah see 

Recording: (2048/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2049/ 9621) 
yeah i well i i think because my dad was 

Recording: (2050/ 9621) 
wow 

Recording: (2051/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (2052/ 9621)

Recording: (2053/ 9621) 
yeah i know that would be neat i would love to do that 

Recording: (2054/ 9621) 
you know she does not have to be wearing that tight outfit i think that is for ratings i really do think it is for ratings um 

Recording: (2055/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (2056/ 9621) 
where it is where it is not such a not weird it is just a family 

Recording: (2057/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (2058/ 9621) 
so i do not know whether he had a boat or any way there was a boat available to him and and he rode across the island 

Recording: (2059/ 9621) 
i that certainly possible there are lots of ways that my friend does it work  in ways that other people do so i think i think a lot of it too has to to do with being comfortable with your yourself and knowing you know i mean i have gotten so much better over the years i was very i have always been real a lot more temper mental we always joke you know that that predictable and some of those things are not uh even temperate or not things you would use to describe me you know but but but not in a negative negative way you know i just think that as i have got know or two i have been able to see things and not be so get so concerned about things that that really were not that important anymore 

Recording: (2060/ 9621) 
sixteen years old uh 

Recording: (2061/ 9621) 
and i realized that so i was like okay i might do it for me but i am going to do it for the future and and that helps 

Recording: (2062/ 9621) 
uh your little clitch click it is like being back in high school 

Recording: (2063/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2064/ 9621) 
oh boy that is that that kind of likes speaks thoroughly about it huh 

Recording: (2065/ 9621) 
we had a thing i i read a book about him that he is in the season on the brinkley they are down there for the couple of years or whatever you know and and he would bring it guys in you know and sit around and say now if you want to be a pd they are down there is where the football team is you know 

Recording: (2066/ 9621) 
freers digest used to write their digest on the eighth grade level they now write it on the sixth grade level newspapers are written between fifth and sixth grade level for the general public it is just either we are getting more and more ld kids that are not trying to read or um kids are just not as motivated because of video games and things that well i read one article that said that because kids sit in front of a television set from the time they are born until they are five when they come to kindergarten they do not want to participate they want to sit back and be entertained and they are expecting you to do all this stuff and they are just going to watch 

Recording: (2067/ 9621) 
over summer and i used the aps and then i drive my dad down on fridays 

Recording: (2068/ 9621)

Recording: (2071/ 9621) 
oh okay that is good 

Recording: (2072/ 9621) 
 break it off because i did not think that was fair uh i think anymore though with uh women are more powerful and i think they they are finally making you know good money and used to be women needed men to take care of them and they were not as much in the work force you know i think things have changed really in the last ten years you know in the eighties still yes uh you know there is definitely a point in my life where i was like oh my i work i am meeting anybody and all my friends honestly most of them were all married but um i enjoyed being single and i never really felt uh the urge just to get married to get married and i am i am glad of that 

Recording: (2073/ 9621) 
oh yeah i was ready  oh yeah  

Recording: (2074/ 9621) 
the two part uh last season where it was they advertise this full of the schooloza 

Recording: (2075/ 9621) 
in 

Recording: (2076/ 9621) 
it i do not know makes our generations  sound like people is huh  

Recording: (2077/ 9621) 
uhhuh but you get i think it is just you high you have all these people and you got to keep their attention for like an hour or two 

Recording: (2078/ 9621) 
yeah it is true and i i i had jazzing and i i you know that was course i was i went to art school so jazzing was just in case you had to look something up that was there um our lectures were all pretty pretty liberal so that you know that the our history we got was was different than what would be what would be just be in chance and so i never thought about that but um 

Recording: (2079/ 9621) 
we are not sure um we are looking to uh we right now and we are looking to buy a house 

Recording: (2080/ 9621) 
yeah we are getting in patient and we are getting um it it is sort of like you know the pendulum will swing back the other way eventually maybe thirty years from now they will be kids will be you know in this country will be learning more than they ever have but right now i think we are we are really not doing justice to the curriculum and i say them my friends i say teach these kids well because they are going to be running the country in our own age we will be sitting a rocking chair and they will be running the country so you have better teach them well when you look at it like that 

Recording: (2081/ 9621) 
you know so i do not know where to go to me the biggest thing would be if they got rid of these saturday night special guns and stuff like that 

Recording: (2082/ 9621) 
which should be done 

Recording: (2083/ 9621) 
no we we have not uh you know there is always that fear uh but we have not 

Recording: (2084/ 9621) 
you did i 

Recording: (2085/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (2086/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2087/ 9621) 
okay okay 

Recording: (2088/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (2089/ 9621) 
yeah right um first of all they are not really in love with you and secondly you are wrong so when i came here um i did not date 

Recording: (2090/ 9621) 
um oh 

Recording: (2091/ 9621) 
what i like best about it is when you are out in the middle 

Recording: (2092/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (2093/ 9621) 
it has this little bridge that goes up to the front door and a creek i mean it is cool 

Recording: (2094/ 9621) 
and some of the teachers actually had the right to search your bags and book bags i mean when it gets to that then  yeah there is there is been teachers they that actually pull students aside if they know they are trouble makers and say well you can not come down here you know and go your locker at this time or whatever 

Recording: (2095/ 9621) 
uh six years ago 

Recording: (2096/ 9621) 
like politically that is uh well like um like i was in high school i was involved in like the democratic in the democratic campaign and just stuff like that just uh i would like to do something i am learning more about the environment because of the staff but i would like to do something otherwise like uh a lot of like business leaders uh they are very they become very conservative when they get higher up because they like the tax break they want to support things like that but i think there should be a good mix like uh there there could still be like a think tank of of executives that could be very liberal in their thinking and just you know for social for social not so much social change but you know not not um encouraging sweatshirts corporations stuff stuff like that and i would like to get i do not know i would get involved in something like that but i would like to it would be interesting 

Recording: (2097/ 9621) 
that does 

Recording: (2098/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2099/ 9621) 
because you know you are trying to run and your dog is trying to greed that dog and the dog is tripping you and your lake i have actually been known to go my the only one follow in the rules around here because i am going to run  if not obviously it is hard for me to run so oh  

Recording: (2100/ 9621) 
oh yeah no i do not know no um honestly no i am pretty sharp in the most part so there is more types of women i do not like it yeah out of it i just i am pretty into size of person i do not like making decisions and she is kind of the same way so when it comes to what we are going to do or whatever it takes its hours to decide what we are going to do it i mean it just gets it over i mean even some places simple is you know where to go out to eat or whatever will spend good half hour forty five minutes just driving around till they actually decide a place or someone says something or whatever so 

Recording: (2101/ 9621) 
yeah and it is a challenge living on one income  that is the way i have got a part time job now so 

Recording: (2102/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (2103/ 9621) 
we we do not necessarily over come bed by bed we are still very much in that from work of restaurants than this on this particular  

Recording: (2104/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (2105/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2106/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2107/ 9621) 
yeah well actually i uh do silk screening for tshirts for like for uh like on the side for myself like to generate income and then also as of monday uh i am working at ohio that is an environmental group i will be be doing canvasing type stuff just basically going doortodos sign this position 

Recording: (2108/ 9621) 
true  

Recording: (2109/ 9621) 
there is no there is no concept behind it  you are right you are right to to some degree they uh area commissions are supposed to work on that and help unify i i used to be on the university area commission in in the campus area and that is one of the things that we work on although we some of the other commission in columbus are almost strictly our protection they only talk about the kinds of building that people can build and the university area commission we dealt with that we dealt with the owning whether something would be commercial or multim family residence we dealt with parking  yeah  a lot yeah yeah 

Recording: (2110/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2111/ 9621) 
it it was difficult uh i can not tell you how many times he had papers or projects due at school that we just have to sit there with him to keep him focused on doing it it one of the uh diagnosis is probably eighty eight d which has trouble with a working memory on how to get a project done and stuff like that uh we talking about how do time lines and guessards and things like that um but it was very difficult for him to be taskly and 

Recording: (2112/ 9621) 
yeah it was fantastic 

Recording: (2113/ 9621) 
humum i must you know that was totally gone but he is been there ever since you know i was pregnant i think my privacy and he is been there for this whole two years i would not do it then 

Recording: (2114/ 9621) 
you know and that was and that worked out well but i think too like with my school schedule you know if i am just in class maybe you know three four days a week and then the rest of the time in the evening jay is not over there so it is not like i am relying on her every single day all the time to do that and i really would not want to put my child in day care 

Recording: (2115/ 9621) 
and they seem like random or just spontaneous and there is no way it was nothing you can do in life to really avoid it except hide hide in your basement or something in that sort of work yeah 

Recording: (2116/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (2117/ 9621) 
and obviously a lot more dangerous and i definitely think that there is a bigger problem with the bigger drugs once you get it to like college or whatever 

Recording: (2118/ 9621) 
exactly it is sitting in the you know germany spain 

Recording: (2119/ 9621) 
well i work in the county department i am an county assistant 

Recording: (2120/ 9621) 
oh because uh some of the newer would yet there is like some that sound like a vacuum cleaner i mean it they are proper planes that are like five times less noisy 

Recording: (2121/ 9621) 
uh i do believe that in some of the cases uh the the parents or the uh responsible adult should be uh found guilty of that 

Recording: (2122/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2123/ 9621) 
and and it am going to hold you to this confidently because very few people know about this 

Recording: (2124/ 9621) 
you know whatever is going on they always have to have a back up plan though and then i know well if this happens this will work and if this does not happen this way then this is all we will do instead 

Recording: (2125/ 9621) 
me too 

Recording: (2126/ 9621) 
i said well he did not they did not spell the vegetables wrong but i doubt if your animal eats parts of building  

Recording: (2127/ 9621) 
i i you know i i just could not see doing that and it was i had enough to worry about and think about while i was trying to teach a class to keep everything else straight and also mark down if people are participating uh that was tough i i ended up not doing it  

Recording: (2128/ 9621) 
oh i am kind of mad at my team at the moment  

Recording: (2129/ 9621) 
umhumwell i i back to friends and uh uh one of them worked at at&e retired and then uh and the other one was on the disability and everything so uh that never even came up in their relationship nor did it come up in uh another couple of friends that i have had you know they they uh they more or less took care of each other you know so 

Recording: (2130/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2131/ 9621) 
i am putting like the the street light they have at houston 

Recording: (2132/ 9621) 
at that point i get back to meet my era 

Recording: (2133/ 9621) 
but uh i i i was interested in to seeing uh coleman be elected yes because uh she was a republican oh i used to work with 

Recording: (2134/ 9621)

Recording: (2143/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (2144/ 9621) 
uh you have got to have the leadership uh you have got to have the right people uh to have this school structured properly and that you know the people with the right credentials uh for the job you know and uh i am telling you some of these principals that uh that i have dealt with uh were highly over paid as far as i was concerned for what they were doing um you know one got one principal that from my um daughter is high school he was out pretty and all the time they you know they he was he was right around in a corvette and uh he tried to take me out

umhum 

Recording: (2181/ 9621) 
right exactly exactly my house is not as clean as i would like it to be but yeah but that is just one minor minor thing and i feel like i am just in a kind of a phase if you will it is you know because they will be grown up in a blink of an eye so if i i mean if i put my career or whatever on hold it is going to be worth it in the long run when my kids are grown up and they can be like yeah mom was there they taught you know mom and dad taught us you know all of our life application skills that we need to do now and i think that that will be better in the long run for them and that is the responsibility i took on as being apparent so that is my job  even though it is monday and  monotonous the time  

Recording: (2182/ 9621) 
yeah well there was not even an opportunity for him to try and think of ways to say and it just there was nothing there there was no ability communicate there was a he needs some of this piece of information at the same time this is the way i could tell it to him so yeah  it was like oh so i am yeah you do not know and there is nothing else to do about it and continue on maryland he i he said eventually he said it was sometime later and i actually found it always going on they said i had the suspicions because you can do a quick party count can figure out who is not there and it seems something bad it happened but um but he said but it was a while before i found out actually so so we can we can stop the story here or we can go like because the story it is a fun story but 

Recording: (2183/ 9621) 
yeah that is how we get so much money he says i we will be paid this much and i will be given this money and had this much minimum per day or i am not working for you and they usually say no no no we will not do that you know and then they will call back a week later okay we will take you he has some really good stories about that oh yeahyeah is quality is not the best and also with uh unix which is 

Recording: (2184/ 9621) 
um because there is some good athletes you look at college especially on the west coast like stanford i have a friend who is from california and 

Recording: (2185/ 9621)

i mean i used to this uh boy like you know jumping all over the house and 

Recording: (2188/ 9621) 
yeah i mean you know  signing oh here you are going um the one i think is pretty obvious that the blind eye was something that should not happen the other one about yeah you just let us face it at that age and at every age we want to lead her um and i guess it goes back if we choose to or we know how to make better decisions for ourselves we will make better decisions of who is going to lead us so i do not know i i think a lot of it is the family unit breaking down in general you know and secondly i think to be honest i think the media is gotten a little carried away they sensationalize it um and i do think uh you know they know they are going to get recognized they are going to have their name go down history unfortunately uh i think that has something to do with it too um it is frustrating to turn on the news they do not really cover my husband comes from a journalistic background and hope you like that is not news you know what i mean it is just we get so uh let us sit here and watch a plain crash for twelve hours instead of watching i do not know what little house and the perry  i do not know i am being facious but you know what i mean 

Recording: (2189/ 9621)

just they are that into being sure you are relaxed enough 

Recording: (2234/ 9621) 
not really a national system it is already been put to national if they rate them state to state and city to city but on on the level of the actual needs of the student you know you can not just put down you know a book and say i want you to put five hundred words on this page why do you like this or just like this book i mean one person can do it and another one i mean you could probably write about thousand words on a page right now about psychology because of your how many years do you have two three 

Recording: (2235/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2236/ 9621) 
not for the uh the train

Recording: (2262/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2263/ 9621) 
um i think they might have tried it somehow but obviously they would not have been as uh good at it or you know what i am trying to say it would not have been as much restriction because obviously the bonds is something but to actually to have that right there i mean have the access and what not i mean i guess the grandparents had the house lock then they broke in but just the fact that they were there and they knew how to use them and that scares me 

Recording: (2264/ 9621)

well the 

Recording: (2280/ 9621) 
or you say something to a kid about um three blind minds 

Recording: (2281/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (2282/ 9621) 
all the politicians i take the governor or take the president of the united states they can want something this way but then they have got the senate and all these other committees down below them that if they overrun what good does he you know what can he do really so i mean no matter what he promised and you are voting him in there for what he is promising you but if he can not backsoven getting these other guys to back him up there they went  

Recording: (2283/ 9621) 
period and it is that is a long process i mean this has been going on for two hundred years this way uh and people are suspicious of government asking questions 

Recording: (2284/ 9621) 
i do not know i i would not personally like think that the parent should be held responsible i mean they do have you know a certain amount of responsibility for the fact that they should have been more aware and and especially because i mean i believe that those at least one of the two had been in counseling and had to you know was doing the on management or something like that um you know you would think that if they were going through something like that you would just sort of you know maybe keep a closer eye on what they were doing so i think you know to that degree you know the parents should have um you know were sort of responsible and also with like their kids dispositionition i mean you know would you not notice some difference or something like that was going to happen i mean depending on uh you know how well they hit it or whatever but um i think at that point though you are you are so influenced by your peers 

Recording: (2285/ 9621) 
so i became a problem business major 

Recording: (2286/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (2287/ 9621) 
hum authority and that kind of stuff it was about someone making a bad choice uh you know gaining power because of it and then ultimately seeing the in the foly of the ways and dying uh tragic hero sort of way um and so i am looking forward to how they build up to that point um a lot of people when i was in high school they would what the hell are you talking about though but uh um yeah i am looking forward to see how things come about 

Recording: (2288/ 9621) 
in austin lsats 

Recording: (2289/ 9621) 
uh it is i mean it is a lot better than was even a year ago

yeah 

Recording: (2293/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (2294/ 9621) 
as a teacher how would you in how could you cut down the student to say no that is not the way it was and this this is your length of the teacher is guide no but how do you know about asking the person but it is a matter of tradition handing down to the tradition itself it is a matter of having in your family what did your parents think of this way in that way and it is it is not let us say written down by it is passed on those days of probably written down by this past long and those days it is probably written down or not written down by a verbal and extended and so it is that hand down from generation 

Recording: (2295/ 9621) 
um living here all my life i do not like it you know i like the old cowboys  i mean they can call it what they want to own it was easy to get around you never had any traffic you do not sit on the freeway like you do now now it is like you do not want to go out at four oclock or you know you just do not want to get involved in it so i do not know you gross is good but i guess i am not into it as much as i a lot of other people it is good for the economy but it is just amazing all the every time you turn around they are plopping two four hundred home unit you know developments up there and around i am just thinking where are these people all coming from you know you just can not imagine where these people all move from you know this is getting scary yeah what is the big draw you know and you know you still see you know when they open up a little and star state near our house they could not even do lunch because they did not have the people i mean so you know that it is the people are just dying for people to work out there

Recording: (2385/ 9621) 
the wrong more so road 

Recording: (2386/ 9621) 
my daughter is a schoolteacher that is been teaching for i do not know ever since she got her degree 

Recording: (2387/ 9621) 
but um i really enjoy that 

Recording: (2388/ 9621) 
yeah can not really take it with you  yeah you can not get it around  you you can not get it around you have to be eighteen to get in the dance clubs now but um that is uh those are the two really really really tough ones that a lot of people will will will throw at you when you are when you are trying to share things with them but there is i mean there is whole there is whole list of them and uh it is just a matter of i mean i i do not i am getting myself to a point where i can go out and share my faith of their people i do not think i am ready to um because one of the biggest problems is like i mentioned with with the brother jet thing is undo the damage other people have done and i do not have enough knowledge up here to really go out and and you know to go out and be like a campus teacher i mean i will i will share my faith with people that i am really close to that like you know calling please and other and other thing and other people that i mean like if somebody if somebody gets real close to me in the class you know eventually i will share and then she will share with them but like if i am in the lecture hall i am not going to jump up and start hollering about my face um and and i will not i will not walk into a coffee shop like a lot of my friends will and sit down and start talking to people i do not feel i am ready to do that yet i think they are a i think there is a place in the time for doing certain things like um and this is this is one of the biggest uh things that people use as as a reason for faith faith is something that people do not understand i do not even understand it i use it as i use it as an answer for a lot of questions that i do not have answers for in space and that is what religion is religion in space every religion has has to have faith you have to believe that what you are doing and what you are believing in is right you know whether everyone else in the world thinks it is or not you have to believe it is is or you being or you being part of that religion has absolutely no meaning and that is an answer that a lot of people do not like to hear and it is you know like um i have walked down like high street before and gotten this urge this feeling to just share my faith with certain people on the on the sidewalks like i share i share my faith uh a little while ago with street bums and they were real receptive you know i do not know if they were receptiveive yeah i do not know if they were real receptive i mean i i do not know if they really understood what i was saying but i felt led to talk to them and that is what i believe my faith is my faith is is faith it is believing that things happen that you can not explain there is it is believing that uh you are doing what you are doing is right so religious is a real big part of my life 

Recording: (2389/ 9621) 
oh god 

Recording: (2390/ 9621) 
huh 

Recording: (2391/ 9621) 
it is made it a little inconvenient when he lived in the uh the twin tower in the dorm because if i needed him to come home or something you know well i do not know if i got to get it get to my car some kind of way you know 

Recording: (2392/ 9621) 
well my question is who is more important in the basketball team the five stars or six man coming off the bench ask it let me hope after or three is he more am is he less important this year than he was last year 

Recording: (2393/ 9621) 
people want a number they do not want to know the methodology that goes into it or the the disclaimeders of footnotes they do not want to read the footnotes they want a number uh when i worked for the state one program i worked on was a occupational employment statistic so it is just collecting uh numbers of toys by different occupations in different industries in different areas of ohio uh which actually used originally started here at the university you know i it was a federal program department labor at this midwest state level and uh it did not did not turn out very well so they switched it over to me uh for a variety of reasons which is not entirely the university is fault uh they had to rely on a of a of a of a if a incidental information which we could not give them because it was of it was continental uh by federal law it was last so we could not give it to them but they needed it so it it was just not a good good way to do business uh if we would present information cater for instance there is this this number of people in an occupation but there was also a range of error on there where people would not notice that and they would take that number of gospel and you just could not convince them that well it really needs more than that uh the big one would be uh wage levels and we did not really at that time collect wage data so if we were kind of a condoid for there were several different departments in the the state in the federal government that collect occupational data we were kind of a condo it for the state for that uhthey did not want a range they did not want they they wanted a number and that is what that was gospel but it is based on survey data and and you know there is always statistical error in there and stuff and trying to explain that to we spent more time when people have called them giving information explaining this is what this really means than uh just giving them the number that we have spent more time doing that uh 

Recording: (2394/ 9621) 
convening  

Recording: (2395/ 9621) 
right you got to pick your battles right 

Recording: (2396/ 9621)

Recording: (2400/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (2401/ 9621) 
i can not really see a problem with it um but like i said i mean if he is going around like picking fights and things like that then i mean i can not said support anyone like that 

Recording: (2402/ 9621) 
hum 

Recording: (2403/ 9621) 
yeah why not take advantage of it yeah why not take advantage of that so 

Recording: (2404/ 9621) 
yeah and i had sold with it well i made it i knew that it boy had it happen on the outside which is really only uh minor painting painting the columns and adding shutters and cleaning up the front yard and then we have there is a guy who works for me who is um i just do not know how you know how he makes the living because he is very very reasonable he is also very loyal to me he is done stuff for me for years and uh and he is not that old he is probably twenty eight or twenty nine now but anyhow went in we added a bathroom there was a bedroom we added a half bath off the kitchen and we put an uh changed the back door and put in the deck and he did those kinds of things and you know and then we were right together and i said i was good size myself and everybody said i was crazy and i had an open house and i sold it that day i had thirty i had like thirty some people in i got my offer that afternoon and i got what i wanted well i did not get immediately i the realtor so many should ask a hundred and thirty four and i asked a hundred and forty six instead because i really felt i am i knew that this was a nice house and i knew had beautiful hardwood floors building bookcases and i just knew that i i could have seen me running that house and do you know what i need is like that i would done anything and so somebody came doing they uh with a realtor and they made me this offer that was real though it was like a hundred and thirty eight and the the realtor uh i am thinking about because it was funny he delivered the offer to my home and i was gracious and i think they might got inside and open up on the pot and they went running on the porch they said wait a minute this is why if we are going to work 

Recording: (2405/ 9621) 
yeah they they will not increase until the tax law revise itself again to up the deduction allowances because even when we were just deductions it went down to them yeah yeah and then again they used to say well you know like uh maybe some excellent uh person would donate in his public size

Recording: (2407/ 9621) 
everybody is living longer everybody is uh there is more medical things where people get uh can be able from things that they could not be able from uh so everybody today is living uh basically as today as our future were back thirty years ago i mean when i was a kid you know i mean i was not really thinking about the day i mean you know i think about tomorrow 

Recording: (2408/ 9621) 
that for uh just uproarro away from the small small bb on that was  kind of tough going 

Recording: (2409/ 9621)

Recording: (2413/ 9621) 
yeah i mean you do not want to see the chain gangs with the people whiping them i mean let us that is not right either um but yeah i am not for the weight rooms because like they said they come out and then they are stronger and  they can do more damage  yeah and you are like great we pay for that okay so i i think just to keep them busy you know even if they educate them i have heard of people you know the education um uh strong i i do not think it really hurt anybody um uh i would say incorporated that with some education um of some you know i mean i do not want to go out and sign and work for five hours or whatnot plus they are doing something in return for free housing do you know what i mean it is kind of a give and take uh 

Recording: (2414/ 9621) 
but i think it should be an option you know i am really you know for women is rights and everything because i was single for so long and i just feel if a man could have a child it would be different but since women are the only ones that can then it ultimate ultimately should be our choice i really do and i think you know we should have every option available especially when you are young little girls should have to go through you know pregnants and everything even if it is a mistake or whatever i just you know they they run for lives when they do not have the option 

Recording: (2415/ 9621)

i was born in los angeles california in the mid fifties and when i was less than one year old my family moved to columbus uh the first place we lived in columbus was in white hall near the corner of hamilton and uh um then shortly after that we moved out to runnowsburg and i i lived there until my sophomore year in high school and uh in during my sophomore year in high school we moved to worthinton and i graduated from high school uh i went to overland college and then i i graduated from there in nineteen seventy six and moved back to columbus and did a variety of jobs in columbus um then i went to ohio state university from nineteen eighty three to ninety one and got a master is degree in geology so i am an aluminum  and uh after that i had another variety of jobs um but i have lived in and well during that time i guess i lived in the university area for a number of years so lived on sixteenth avenue near the fairgrounds and uh let us see had a number of different jobs currently i work at uh hill yard and i live in the worthinton uh in the south part of worthing and i am renting a room for my mom from i yes  and it it sort of sticks that backwards and right now i am saving up money and trying to buy a house somewhere and something i am sort of kicking myself which i would have done about twenty or thirty years ago because it would have been a lot cheaper  right right it was not a top priority for me then  yeah

think about things i mean it is pretty easy to do 

Recording: (2452/ 9621) 
well i agree that we should help them maybe through some sort of government program but i think what really hurts them the most is the people that actually give them the money on high street because it really does not motivate them to get out of the gutter i mean if they can make a living off of bagging change off of college students they are probably going to stay with that because it is a really easy life 

Recording: (2453/ 9621) 
yeah four or five years it is not that bad how old oh that is very young yeah you do not want another one yet  at least you know diapers out of the way before you go to the next one you know 

Recording: (2454/ 9621) 
i think the point is they are on drugs you know and i do not yeah i am not i do not consider myself raises at all it is not fortunate that that is what is happening but it is just one of those things like you hate to say yeah i am for it because you sound like it is like everything is specific and permanent yeah i kind of have a problem with that um because they might change their mind but then again they can always adopt you know and i kind of look at it that way there is enough kids out there that need love and 

Recording: (2455/ 9621) 
gosh you know that is one of the things that i really you know when i read the paper i think wow what can you do it has to start there first you know and i think if uh and i in this might be because i am a woman but i think if women started running things it would be a lot different than when men run things because men tend to thing you know like the government and that kind of thing those kind of uh funds that are available for different organizations they are all geared toward things that essentially help them as a whole or help um well yeah but i mean not so much that um it is always been the women is responsibility to be responsible for the kids or to care about their well being and a peaceful environment and all that kind of thing men are more that is go get it and you know we need more money and you know they are 

Recording: (2456/ 9621) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (2457/ 9621) 
i am sure i am sure it is you know it is just the circles i move in 

Recording: (2458/ 9621) 
umhum uh yeah you you know well you can see it here i mean you uh see some nineteen year old eighteen year old uh guy or girl or whatever you know see the difference in the maturity you know of of the another couple or three different people or everything uh i do not know whether me coming from like your rural area you know my a and everything uh i think it maybe has something to do with that even to today you know you are more uh family oriented uh uh your your friends are basically you know you count them on your hands which you still can but uh but you socialize a lot more up here in the city with more people and everything more if you come from like a smaller town you can socialized with a certain people you know group or or whatever 

Recording: (2459/ 9621) 
uh i got done out of high school 

Recording: (2460/ 9621) 
i mean he is he is kind of in big trouble they they are wanting to pull the charter on him and everything so that but he is going to try and um keep the school open which is going to be ridiculous 

Recording: (2461/ 9621) 
four girls 

Recording: (2462/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2463/ 9621) 
better so long 

Recording: (2464/ 9621) 
eight my job i am doing at work she ai not 

Recording: (2465/ 9621) 
i do not agree with that at all i think if their parents are unhappy together only thing that is going to happen is it is going to trick down and you are going to have to listen to them being miserable and and i think it is much more positive to have two families that are happy than one family that is miserable and they fight and then you feel like you are you know people feel it is my fault because this happened you know and i think for me it was easier that they split up when i was younger than i can not imagine being a teenager and having my parents split up i think that that would be probably very difficult um so i do not that is a totally different perspective to to look at it from from that point of view just because i was a lot younger 

Recording: (2466/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2467/ 9621) 
like while she was studying or something i think we played this homeless simpsons movie she got she got so mad it was so worth it 

Recording: (2468/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2469/ 9621) 
it it might uh it might um i was going to say earlier and i and i forgot to mention it is that one of the best campaigns i have seen in recent years usedizing college a students has been clinton is campaign both times uh he knew he needed to get a base to increase uh his chances of winning the election and did especially in the first campaign in i believe that was ninety two did a really super job of organized college students because that is when you are at your most um well when you believe in things and you are at your most idealistic and you would think that you know kids would automatically be interested in something and he was able to tap into that um in addition to that and is an under current it was not a very the vice of issue in this company but i know when i talked to people uh and you have to be careful where you do this because abortion is not a very the vice of issue in this country and i think it does mobilize people but it also divisions them you know it it is a of coursely almost like in vietnam almost like that war to fight it people um but i would tell many many women that they had to vote for clinton because it was a difference between protecting droveers is weight and not and in protecting choice you know um and i i am starting to see that now even in in the gore campaign there i have seen a couple of editorials in the paper about you know the next president will again have an opportunity to point two to three supreme court justices and if that if you want to protect that right you have got to vote with the candidate who is going to put the best justices on the supreme court and i got a lot of people to vote for clinton that way both in ninety two and again in four years at ninety six uh and i think that is going to happen again because the the candidates and i am telling you my politics here go ahead and early but the candidates have pretty well spoken on that issue already i know which one will protect the right for choice uh and um i i think we need to protect that so yes i think it will but i do not think it is an issue that if you did overtly and said you know support canada or canada b because they will protect abortion rights that is going to divide the country and not keep us together 

Recording: (2470/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (2471/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (2472/ 9621) 
i am not real big on the denominationations because i think that i think that sort of goes against what their original intent of of christianity was i i mean it was designed to be a unifying religion and this denomination of nations there are just are are just yeah i just i do not like them  

Recording: (2473/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (2474/ 9621) 
yeah right i taught um well i was a speech the office probably five or six years and then ever since that i have been in 

Recording: (2475/ 9621) 
i would say probably the black man 

Recording: (2476/ 9621) 
like where i work at the only way i can get a raise is by being uh like the kids used to say it is paddle tail squeal or whatever you want to call 

Recording: (2477/ 9621) 
um going out my father had restaurants and a couple private clubs and so i have always been registered in the food industry but more so with planning of the parties and deciding you know what the clients need are and uh i really like working in that aspect with you know nice shops and really creative food and um it is nice because every basically every job is usually different um i am doing a function tonight for three hundred people for the higher republican party and you know there is just needs for each thing that i do which makes it interesting 

Recording: (2478/ 9621) 
 if you have to come back to this weather i would just i is not really 

Recording: (2479/ 9621) 
but uh 

Recording: (2480/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (2481/ 9621) 
now we run an on line system where people us connect to our system and build the data bases or or access to the data bases uh it is state the uh everything of course you have in their library collection is in our system their records came from us uh oh i see yeah well they yeah and we do that for uh tens of thousand some labor yeah 

Recording: (2482/ 9621) 
about it 

Recording: (2483/ 9621) 
uh kind of yeah uh actually with this case i do know what happened to the father they ended up moving to colorado uh 

Recording: (2484/ 9621) 
uh being here at the university 

Recording: (2485/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (2486/ 9621) 
yeah you spend the money to live there and then you go somewhere else i really do not understand that some people do it 

Recording: (2487/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2488/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2489/ 9621) 
but you do not really have to work because they are there apparently 

Recording: (2490/ 9621) 
i did get better grades last nine weeks did not i oh it is not amazing you were taking your bill then some connection here  so you kind of just have to sit them down and and say well let us just go through some of the things that give you trouble and we will write them down and say oh well that is nice that you have not been able to focus on that this nine weeks that you have not been able to focus on that maybe does not does not help you some maybe you just you know not giving it credit 

Recording: (2491/ 9621) 
umhum yeah she went to school here till uh ninety one actually uh so she was let us see about the fourth grade the third grade something like that 

Recording: (2492/ 9621) 
to say you know what i am sick of that somebody shoots those people but i 

Recording: (2493/ 9621) 
as far as what he did i i am sure they probably did get a meeting but uh as far as being a leader or something like that he i know i do not i am sure he was not 

Recording: (2494/ 9621) 
and uh i think they have a lot to do you know the parks and things like that so uh i just hold it  but i like it because it has art and culture and uh it does not feel like a big city 

Recording: (2495/ 9621) 
most of them are still sad at least your family just sitting the other side of my directions but they are getting even better 

Recording: (2496/ 9621) 
something could do that here  

Recording: (2497/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (2498/ 9621) 
really you know i agree i mean none of the above that you go and i think a lot of more people would certainly go out they would vote for none of the above and then we could have some working at it 

Recording: (2499/ 9621) 
yeah i know it is good one of us  

Recording: (2500/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2501/ 9621) 
that was grade school 

Recording: (2502/ 9621) 
i mean some really well 

Recording: (2503/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2504/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2505/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2506/ 9621) 
obviously it is not something new that is been coming around i mean it is i have been around for a long time 

Recording: (2507/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2508/ 9621) 
well what my opinion on our whole penal system is just you know well it goes along we are not we are kind of neglecting the kids in our schools right now and we are definitely neglecting criminals they need to have be educated and and worked with i mean they need to obviously they some place some point they have uh learned correct in correct reasoning or whatever you call it and they need to uh they need to have psychological help period 

Recording: (2509/ 9621) 
but it did not bother me uh religions basically everybody when i was in there back in the sixties uh i mean everybody was pretty much a christian you know christianity the cast or something like that but uh nowadays you know you have the uh uh more outspoken us on most most ones and uh israel and all of jeez i did not do anything so and then there again i do not have a problem with that you know because you you have got a nature so you know you have got to make your peace with your make because you know if you believe in religion you are are here separately for an attorney later on you know 

Recording: (2510/ 9621) 
news bend real helpful you know with uh uh being at support you know my parents are very supportive but you know it was just sicken they i when i sat down there and they just you know the itings started at a hundred twenty five thousand dollars and actually they offered us twelve thousand dollars and my turn they looked at it and said all right if i can once i said this guy had his head split open and it was your neglect so you know will take that as an assault 

Recording: (2511/ 9621) 
to come in to make came with our neighbors life years ago you knew everybody in in town well the town i grew up from a summer station i do not know if you like oh teny many town or not but it is not a very big town and everybody knew everybody 

Recording: (2512/ 9621) 
i wish i knew the answer uh but the reality you know uh i just feel sorry for the the people that not only feel that they have to do that but and also for the people that are involved in it and the other this victims and everything and their parents and their everything the only one i really had uh i was really upset with uh with a common buying deal and that was because uh the one kid was making bonds and stuff like that and the base that an appearance and knew nothing about or or they did they did not even think anything about it and i do not think that behavior is uh appropriate for uh sixteen seventeen year old kid 

Recording: (2513/ 9621) 
um because he he likes the you like what do this hitting spell where you like to hit people and i smack his hands for that and i try not to yell but it is hard  not to yell i try to talk to him 

Recording: (2514/ 9621) 
oh yeah where members are there 

Recording: (2515/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2516/ 9621) 
uh and he had been through a counseling experience before and they he just played along with it then to get out of it i think but 

Recording: (2517/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2518/ 9621) 
nothing serious now 

Recording: (2519/ 9621) 
so i mean basically the entire winter i would either be doing stuff by myself or on the team wrestling with my friends so the whole reason i quit wrestling is because the coach wanted me to cut too much weight um i have i was really starting to feel it physically 

Recording: (2520/ 9621) 
okay so our back ones still there but ultimately as we get traffic uh measurements but we will be able to down size the number of prices we have so streamlining our network 

Recording: (2521/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (2522/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2523/ 9621) 
whatever you want sure 

Recording: (2524/ 9621) 
i am sure uh 

Recording: (2525/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2526/ 9621) 
uhhuh  

Recording: (2527/ 9621) 
and we stayed there for a while and then she met my stepdad when i was about like six years old i think and then they moved up uh to clintonville about when i was about eight and now my dad lives in up in clintonville too so 

Recording: (2528/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2529/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2530/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (2531/ 9621) 
i that is another thing that that we are i am in ros with my parents who that they do not understand the fact that why would i go to college i paid for it myself i worked my way through school i i was so proud of the fact that i was like only a quarter late of my actual schedule to graduate which is pretty amazing given the fact that i was paying for it as i went and and i did not have any loans i was when i was done it was paid for and so um of course tuition was a hundred twenty five dollars a quarter but i was only making you know fifty cents an hour at the bevely across the street on the al avenue so um uh but but anyhow you know they could never understand you know you did not you never got a job with it you know why would you go to school and waste all that money i even sent this money i ever spent it 

Recording: (2532/ 9621) 
you know they are just trying to spread out a little bit and eventually it will be something a little more nationwide but they really just wanted to start off with something easy and um they only take national merit dollars in there 

Recording: (2533/ 9621) 
turn the turn the music up and it is already blasted you know 

Recording: (2534/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2535/ 9621) 
and they found a lot and there is a lot of violence and then i love walt disney i mean all that stuff they have beautiful music but i i swear i have not seen a walt disney movie that does not have violence in it 

Recording: (2536/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2537/ 9621) 
absolutely 

Recording: (2538/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2539/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (2540/ 9621) 
well it is going to be easier than this you know 

Recording: (2541/ 9621) 
in the world 

Recording: (2542/ 9621) 
yeah exactly exactly 

Recording: (2543/ 9621) 
yeah and just a couple things i remember when i first started going to the unitary church up here on uh well when i was in in sunday school we we drove there from reynoldsburg by going up i think reynoldsburg near walley road up to uh more is road and then over on more slowed to high street so it was it was from the back roads you know  and that was before the mid sixties when the freeway was built i seventy was built through the town and a lot of a lot of times you do not realize what kind of habit that creates when the freeways built through the middle of the town because you have to take out of one houses to do that  because of the freeways there and see the side continue on the other side and you think about there must have been twenty or three houses that they had to take out here 

Recording: (2544/ 9621) 
but they lived in a beautiful home i mean if you are to uh i mean kids like that i can see that they are in poor in garland or whatever but these kids lived in a nice neighborhood in a beautiful home in colorado i mean you know i just think they were removed from what their children and their son was doing 

Recording: (2545/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2546/ 9621) 
so it is not uh there was a man named sun man who was uh recruitinguting women you know and tell them they had the sweat naked 

Recording: (2547/ 9621) 
i mean i could practically graduate already i have all their credits but then you have those required classes that you have to take 

Recording: (2548/ 9621) 
i do not say that of all of the kids because i know that some of them were brought up right 

Recording: (2549/ 9621) 
you know my older sister a different case you live better but it it you know as long as you have a good parent it you know i think that is really all that matters because my mom was my mother in father she she did very well 

Recording: (2550/ 9621) 
medicare type of 

Recording: (2551/ 9621) 
oh wow how would you pick up with that or it you just happened 

Recording: (2552/ 9621) 
yes private homes and um actually where i work there is not a facility 

Recording: (2553/ 9621) 
go out 

Recording: (2554/ 9621) 
but on the way i can get a raise over there where i work at 

Recording: (2555/ 9621) 
he was living with this one family for a while uh and they were noticed and taking him to news camps and stuff like this and uh what do you think they would they never had in contact with us they just let them move in can you imagine letting a fourteen year old friend just move in and not find out why or  

Recording: (2556/ 9621) 
i mean colin powell was pretty close if he would have ran 

Recording: (2557/ 9621) 
her house in india is like it is mentioned and they have servants there i mean it is really impressive just the house they are just worth more so you can not get as much house here but yeah everybody doing well  

Recording: (2558/ 9621) 
it 

Recording: (2559/ 9621) 
we come to many games as we can um uh we both golf and um we like hiking swimming uh every year we used to go on a trip this year we went to new mexico we would think about moving out there 

Recording: (2560/ 9621) 
we do we develop a lot of software in projects and i control it on the data base side 

Recording: (2561/ 9621) 
and it is been good for my son 

Recording: (2562/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2563/ 9621) 
and you do not we do not to this that so i am trying to stick to that so that is right um 

Recording: (2564/ 9621) 
yeah and and the problem is uh the problem is seeing things in other people i mean actually seeing spirit in other people in terms of someone said they eyes the mirrors of the salt that is very true you know i could see in certain people is eyes when i was in the hospital the confusion the unsure feelings you know the uh i do not know it is something that i could see there that i can not explain and i still can not explain it i just know what i see and then i go on trying to tell the psychologists psychiatrist where they want to put me on some kind of antifluis and jennic medication and i said well this is man you know i am not loose in any 

Recording: (2565/ 9621) 
so i keep it was it but then the move well there we go 

Recording: (2566/ 9621) 
right right 

Recording: (2567/ 9621) 
by the eighth grade they are sixth and seventh graders you pretty much know everything and you are the stupid one but by the time they get to eighth grade they are going oh you are the best teacher i could believe it it is not that to you  

Recording: (2568/ 9621) 
and i think uh in my opinion i think mainly uh it it is the absence of uh basically parenting you know uh my mom was there uh she was a housewife you know and uh so she was she went to work after them i think when i was a junior in high school you know and my brother and all my brothers and sisters are graduated you know so 

Recording: (2569/ 9621) 
she went to nice school she just barely works at all apparently 

Recording: (2570/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (2571/ 9621) 
not really he is kind of lay on the floor and watch everybody else go around 

Recording: (2572/ 9621) 
you know you have to be a good example i mean if you if you are just that for your kids then that is all they need you know you might not always do the right things or say the right things but if you are taking care of yourself and you stay positive and do the right things and think that is the best you can do for them 

Recording: (2573/ 9621) 
so he gives them a drug call well future one which is a i do not know like an in and i depressed type thing that they said works for uh eighty hd but it really helped him you know concentrate to be able to study 

Recording: (2574/ 9621) 
i am doing different points today i dont know 

Recording: (2575/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (2576/ 9621) 
but it made a lot of people more aware 

Recording: (2577/ 9621) 
well i think they need to do away with a lot of the foster homes uh you know a lot of the you know there is people with good intentions but i just think that it just needs to be restructureded totally different way and uh you know maybe pull these kids uh into more of a group setting or something and give them more um you know counseling uh professional you know counseling because it is uh you know i i did not have good experiences with foster homes and and i know of a lot of kids you know that are saying that i think the parents have too many rates you know in the courts and there is just a lot going on you know that uh it is not going to get better it is going to get worse you know with the way families are torn apart now and uh you know mothers have to work and uh you just can not you know stay home and be that uh you know perfect mom you know so there is just a lot going on uh that needs to be rest structured so 

Recording: (2578/ 9621) 
the 

Recording: (2579/ 9621) 
i mean obviously if someone is like thirty in a day i do not see them as being too wanting to change their entire life basically at that point in time 

Recording: (2580/ 9621) 
if you were not here well he was the first capital punishment case in ohio in uh twenty or twenty five years or something like that and he had kills somebody and he was on death row and he wanted to be executed and i thought that is a cop out if there ever was one just to give him a lethal injection and let him go he should have run it in prison for a  no that is not a punishment he was off his rocker there was not anybody who murders who is not insane 

Recording: (2581/ 9621) 
and they had they they went through their own training and everything and we did not ever face with each other or nothing like that you know i mean you might see one walking or march and somewhere but as far as brotherizing you were not allowed to 

Recording: (2582/ 9621) 
it so corrupt they have two choices to stay in it and try or to still come to all the things and ninety percent of them i do not know that you can see what happens in washington have still come you know there is uh i do not i do not hear any of them raising how about what really matters in this country 

Recording: (2583/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (2584/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (2585/ 9621) 
um i do not really know i see i mean it is definitely okayless nature and definitely something has to be done to them 

Recording: (2586/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (2587/ 9621) 
just a little hard to accept uh you know i it is it is it is hard to know what he is going through with how much of it is uh normal teenage and and how much of it is just 

Recording: (2588/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (2589/ 9621) 
well yeah when he was i do not remember how many months they went on for like two months where he just cried it might have been kind of like or whatever but he just cried and yep 

Recording: (2590/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (2591/ 9621) 
and because about the um um running director that was here at the time he quit because he did not want to fire them and they over ruled him 

Recording: (2592/ 9621) 
and so i get a lot of you know what from my sisters  

Recording: (2593/ 9621) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (2594/ 9621) 
yeah i was in the sales department through telephone marketing there was actual sales that i was doing i was there for fifteen years 

Recording: (2595/ 9621) 
it is like a double scene i guess we 

Recording: (2596/ 9621) 
and then remember back on it 

Recording: (2597/ 9621) 
like everywhere but uh it is real weird 

Recording: (2598/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (2599/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2600/ 9621) 
my i think that my opinion is that if you can go to school and you are not going you know at work and everything you should uh be doing something besides causing problems you know and a lot of kids that is all they really want to do nowadays is just cause an aggravation opinion 

Recording: (2601/ 9621) 
to the hub uh which of course made down time but with uh that we were not in the position to monitor traffic 

Recording: (2602/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (2603/ 9621) 
and i think um of course we would all hope that abortion would not be that that nobody would have an abortion that would be the perfect world because nobody would ever be in a situation where they would need one um but i also think i you know i i mean yeah they should not be they should not should not spend six weeks on abortion  or six six weeks what to do if you are pregnant uh but but i think the subject has to be mentioned just just in passing in health class maybe and then and then there ought to it should be it it should be known that you can go to your counselor 

Recording: (2604/ 9621)

Recording: (2605/ 9621) 
of the medical school class which is two hundred twenty 

Recording: (2606/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (2607/ 9621) 
needs journal all the all the kids went into that just so intensive and they were supposed to be real good guys but i mean uh the visual was pretty miserable in my opinion opinion they wore these math and hoods and 

Recording: (2608/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2609/ 9621) 
kind of you know we know but it 

Recording: (2610/ 9621) 
that would be great i would do it definitely 

Recording: (2611/ 9621) 
if you got a car it is easy to get there yeah but uh if you if you are right above it sometimes so takes a couple hours 

Recording: (2612/ 9621) 
in some ways i like it and some ways it is not my favorite place but it seems like it is relatively safe place to live although that is coming from me i have been robbed a gun point or and i have point about four times i think in columbus yeah maybe five uh i drove a taxi cab for a couple of summers and i was robbed think twice driving the cab and part of it was just being stupid but it was down around the mountain area and uh it got very little money but i was not heard  

Recording: (2613/ 9621) 
on tv and in the movie 

Recording: (2614/ 9621) 
i love columbus actually um when i left i was caught up with columbus and but like anything you know after being away for a while and not really you know being i mean i have friends there and everything but you know i miss my friends and i miss really sort of you know knowing everything in the city because london is never going gonna be like that for me you know and it is just a totally different experience and you know i did miss columbus and i am kind of glad to be back although now i miss london so  

Recording: (2615/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2616/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2617/ 9621) 
they tried sampling well our brother rich was one of the families they sampled 

Recording: (2618/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (2619/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2620/ 9621) 
instead they pick up on oh so and so it was arrested for drug dealing today he you know so and so age and they sort of give background on him and that is what everyone bases their view on it seems to be is that everyone turns to the media to see what is going on when the media is only showing one side of the story i mean there is definitely much more out there that is going on then they are killing you um so i really do not see a big problem with the way the america is going or whatever to the youth uh and like i would not say it is any worse than any past generations i mean other than like i mean obviously guns and things like that are being around but simply the reason being was because in past generations they were not around for it 

Recording: (2621/ 9621) 
yeah that we did not really get the the video tape they gave us was half informationals and then  it was really nothing 

Recording: (2622/ 9621) 
yeah it actually his dad is mother babysit 

Recording: (2623/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (2624/ 9621) 
but the professors see more centered centered to me they are like you have to balance it which i am sure is the truth you know you can not diminished all your bottom line for you know making your work your still good but there is still something to it i think 

Recording: (2625/ 9621) 
again gets back to the ten percent tiding and uh uh i think it is something else in the bible where you know she the lady gives gives only a small portion compared to a large portion but in relation to what her income was it meant a lot more and that we need to get more involved in that we need to promote more of that if we are going to package things and materialized we need to take more of that but i think right take home and i what would you be doing if you were a third world country did not have choice 

Recording: (2626/ 9621) 
i said this will never work i am not interested to take it back and he said no no no just let us just work with it just work with it so i end up giving him for a higher forty four but it was just funny cause i thought i thought they are never never gonna get to where i have to be and we are not even gonna play this game back and forth 

Recording: (2627/ 9621) 
i thought it was stupid 

Recording: (2628/ 9621) 
um i mean obviously it is something that happens every day and things like that um it is like i said by no means my saying yeah go president clinton or anything like that but uh i mean i can not stand it against him for doing something like that i mean it is something that threaten the nation or whatever 

Recording: (2629/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (2630/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (2631/ 9621) 
uh i think that 

Recording: (2632/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (2633/ 9621) 
umhum umhum yeah i guess my i guess what i would say mostly for that is that the parents are too busy with their own careers and they do not take time to raise their kids and establish the morals in the home and they are just like oh well they will learn it there or whatever and the kids um they are basic where they learn things is their peers they do not get everything in still at home uh that is pretty much what you know i seen talk it to my husband and you know and there are so many broken homes and single moms and trying trying to do it all and the kids are the ones that are suffering and have them grow up before they are ready 

Recording: (2634/ 9621) 
i think there might be but i think most of them are dying breed they are the older citizens uh many in my generation uh they there is probably be because i am i am the early baby boom i am i am the first of the baby boom uh and that is when the woman is movement started and many men they are still have not always accepted that so there might be a problem there but before the the the generations even the later baby boom generations behind me when i talk to them i talk to uh high school students or even young college students um there there is a a whole world of difference between their attitudes and a lot of things and you know women is minority issues they just back in hand to them and it does not you know it is not like it was for us which was a sea change for them it is normal for them and more of those people are in the voting population if they would vote  you know you would have to find a candidate who would know how to do what clinton did in ninety two and get out that college vote 

Recording: (2635/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (2636/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2637/ 9621)

Recording: (2638/ 9621) 
uh not as much as i used to be when i was younger must be die hard but not anymore you know umhum yeah by their standards but they still were six or six you know and they probably could a one maybe a couple more games but that is about it you know going 

Recording: (2639/ 9621) 
uhhuh it it was cool  yeah so i i like pretty much all kinds of music yeah big sometimes to find the kind of music i really do not like that much and i like some country music my i guess my favorites are are classical and uh rock rock and roll especially i like some of the stuff that is coming out now i like oldies from the seventies and sixties and uh i guess what is hard for me to listen to is they just played the same songs over and over again yeah 

Recording: (2640/ 9621) 
oh my gosh they do not have any of these like student mattoes especially going up like up like fifty huh  

Recording: (2641/ 9621)

Recording: (2643/ 9621) 
to do that 

Recording: (2644/ 9621) 
well that 

Recording: (2645/ 9621) 
i should not be having to clean quite as much as i do now uh i would say by ten they should be able to help me prepare a meal or be able to pretty much do most of it by themselves i know i did it and and to be able to do their laundry maybe definitely help out a lot around the house 

Recording: (2646/ 9621) 
hum 

Recording: (2647/ 9621)

Recording: (2653/ 9621) 
like i know like i was a four year member student council and they did that they went that route to high school and i know we always tried to involve other people but like they would look at us and be like that so lame i would never do it 

Recording: (2654/ 9621)

Recording: (2659/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (2660/ 9621) 
and is the way i put it it is kind of new agey and i do not like new agey stuff but you know it is the best example is the malls from the dark when you flip on the light the malls will go right to it a child like that a young man like that is very impressionable very young still and uh these bad spars will be locked right to him 

Recording: (2661/ 9621) 
what uh i have not read enough to know i i saw uh uh uh a preliminary saying that they were going to protest and uh but i do not i i am not informed enough to give an opinion on that 

Recording: (2662/ 9621) 
yeah okay see the way i look at heaven myself is that i had a chance to meet all my acquaintances i had over the pass 

Recording: (2663/ 9621) 
you know how to modify like i give in services all the time at my school for the regular red teachers and i show them they go well that is going to make more work for me and i say how is telling the student to do every other problem instead of all forty of them going to make 

Recording: (2664/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (2665/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (2666/ 9621) 
do you know what i mean 

Recording: (2667/ 9621) 
yeah one of my uh friend is cousins went to that for kennedy um i do not remember what the cause was of his death um but i mean like i said i mean they definitely they used the dangerous drug to be used and and i mean not to say that they should legalize it or anything i mean obviously that is pretty extreme to do but like i said i mean it is something more or they where people should know the risks of it and and i know what goes into it i mean it is sort of like if you saw something laying on the street and you decided to eat it or whatever 

Recording: (2668/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (2669/ 9621) 
well um my family he said funny because my parents are saying you would never put them together now you know in back that you know my my well he is on my mother i mean you did not dear it all you do he is just kidding he is kind of a little hair cat she is on my mom i mean uh you did not dear it you  she is cute she is got a little hair cat she is our like  but um 

Recording: (2670/ 9621) 
no the worst thing that happened was that while it got stolen out of the locker 

Recording: (2671/ 9621) 
relax yeah 

Recording: (2672/ 9621) 
yeah  

Recording: (2673/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (2674/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2675/ 9621) 
it really does not look like i mean 

Recording: (2676/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (2677/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (2678/ 9621) 
and it is like a car has a computer but it does not know if it is uh monday or two thousand and fifty it has no idea it it means nothing it is not data sensitive you know so 

Recording: (2679/ 9621) 
no we have been yeah it was the only german flavor so we are uh pro double guys 

Recording: (2680/ 9621) 
and pardon him sounds pretty good so 

Recording: (2681/ 9621) 
i like it better than a magazine 

Recording: (2682/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2683/ 9621) 
uh it was for me and a couple of other people and that was it 

Recording: (2684/ 9621) 
but 

Recording: (2685/ 9621) 
well i among the people i know i i you know works i i think it is a pretty tolerant city um uh i know a lot of people who live down in old town you know in a very uh diverse environment and uh um uh i am i just do not i do not personally know any races i do not think 

Recording: (2686/ 9621) 
umhum yeahno there was more uh just getting you know and if you get a kiss or something you know or got ridged up to the old you know i mean you know 

Recording: (2687/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (2688/ 9621) 
yeah more yeah or more you know i i do not even know because to start it is just such a huge problem and it is gotten so out of hand it is going to be everybody all together that has to work it is going to be the teachers and the government and everybody but they all have to have one common thing and it cracks me up because we are so concerned about alien this this poor little kid everybody knows who he is but you know you look at our own kids we do not even care about our own kids as much as we care i mean here is this little kid who still has a living period and and i do not understand that at all i mean that is just so i think the government gets involved in totally you know way out of line and 

Recording: (2689/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2690/ 9621) 
um this stuff as opposed to like sitting around and playing computer games first of all because it is more interesting it is a lot more practical you know it is a little more problem solving less right around the shooting things you know um it is like problem solving they you know little puzzles it is not as much sit in front of a tv and be entertained it is you create your own entertainment oh 

Recording: (2691/ 9621) 
oh i do not i do not believe it you can 

Recording: (2692/ 9621) 
yeah i do not see that kind of raise in at all 

Recording: (2693/ 9621) 
it it is interesting too because when she had her other child uh her she had made a range she was at a you have made arrangements that and she was made arrangements that uh she might have to be in the hospital taking a final with one of her teachers that baby was born in march so i think she got the finals right in or you know it is he is just too much stress for me to even think about  

Recording: (2694/ 9621) 
even though i knew better at the point when i was faced with that at seventeen or whatever i wanted to be loved so bad that it was something that i you know what i mean and i knew better but you just you know and it is like well i was not that strong granted but i was probably the normal team and i think most of the people i knew at that age were lost it much younger than seventeen you know uh again at eleven twelve was like who in key we would look alike  if i could get it but uh yeah so i think i think birth control would be good and 

Recording: (2695/ 9621) 
end of march i do not have a point to get you know to have a year old pass though 

Recording: (2696/ 9621) 
umhum he was he did some assistant coach work at uh lsuis u perotas u he really liked that um 

Recording: (2697/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2698/ 9621) 
because apparently they apparently they get really fascinated by the fact that the lights are moving around right in front of them so i do that for i do run from the front of my face and they would be like doing the same thing 

Recording: (2699/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2700/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (2701/ 9621) 
i was married but i did not have any kids one sure have kids and not gonna be able to do that kind of a schedule but um yeah so i did not take off anytime and then when i got my masters i ran into an old friend of mine who teaches in worth and he said oh i am the special ed director up there now we need a resource room to teach him why do not you come up in an interview for this position or that position or when i went up and interviewed for that position and got another position but anyway it all worked out 

Recording: (2702/ 9621) 
yeah yeah just sit on the she is not allowed on the couch but we had caught her last winter on the couch you know you come home and it is warm and hey there is a doggy bone up here hm 

Recording: (2703/ 9621) 
even they do not get fax right a lot of the time uh 

Recording: (2704/ 9621) 
and i could not be part of a veterinarian practice that uh did that 

Recording: (2705/ 9621) 
um there were one or two 

Recording: (2706/ 9621) 
oh sure yeah 

Recording: (2707/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2708/ 9621) 
but that is what i 

Recording: (2709/ 9621) 
so it is really weird because uh 

Recording: (2710/ 9621) 
um right right and and it seems to me kind of a questionable thing just how a teacher i am supposed to get an a what is wrong with you  what is wrong with you 

Recording: (2711/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2712/ 9621) 
huh 

Recording: (2713/ 9621) 
of course that never happened 

Recording: (2714/ 9621) 
so it worked out well 

Recording: (2715/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2716/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2717/ 9621) 
and it is more and more people are getting older and older they will be more neat  if you feel a lot of things that is going to be more needful as people get over 

Recording: (2718/ 9621) 
oh i felt funny that i am i mean i wish i was married if i was married it would be so much simpler in life but you know it just it did not work out you know i was with his father for like nine years until i was sixteen and he just did not grow up once we had him he did not change like i changed and so 

Recording: (2719/ 9621) 
i do not want either of these people 

Recording: (2720/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (2721/ 9621) 
yeah he is a real nice guy 

Recording: (2722/ 9621) 
 yeah you should be we are all aware because the school has a big impact on the children and sometimes not all that positive right now so you know but you can tell how your child is doing of course 

Recording: (2723/ 9621) 
um seventeen and nineteen 

Recording: (2724/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2725/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (2726/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (2727/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (2728/ 9621) 
this is the only society that labels them mentally ill 

Recording: (2729/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (2730/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (2731/ 9621) 
but at the same time i mean i do not  just like them or anything for it i mean it is it is their choice i mean in fact the matter is it does not have any effect or anything on my life so 

Recording: (2732/ 9621) 
i picked up one kid he he had been in uh he was only about fifteen he was adopted and he ran away 

Recording: (2733/ 9621) 
no i mean like i said i think little kids are going to be little kids if that stuff was not on tv they are still going to act the same way they are still going to be walk around with toy guns and things like that playing war or whatever 

Recording: (2734/ 9621) 
i mean i mean that is that is a lot of money for having a good time you know 

Recording: (2735/ 9621) 
k telling you some people go to the vet at the name i worked down at children is hospital when i was in college uh at the ear nose and throat out patient clinic a couple summers and i am telling you i to put some names on the books like you would not believe i am uh garland that was her name i am uh garland there was a little boy named f from zimbleus junior cocoa made uh franklin i am supposed to sit that in the space i am oh telling you 

Recording: (2736/ 9621) 
my name is 

Recording: (2737/ 9621) 
you know about seventy thousand dollars and uh uh it was just a hard decision to make you know because i felt you know a lot more should have come from that i mean and a joke around you know i saw that adam taylor movie a big daddy he got his foot run over by a cabin that was all right in there person in anyway he says uh well i got my foot run over my cab and that cab was huge and a jury decided that one night of pain in the hospital was worth two hundred thousand dollars 

Recording: (2738/ 9621) 
and a lot more um different suburbs so maybe it is it is going in and becoming a little lousier 

Recording: (2739/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2740/ 9621) 
and i just sit there for a minute before i take it out i take it on out and sit on top of the time and i said well mommy said a bad word i guess that uh mommy has to have that still going to her mouth do not you oh i can not get that this thing in the money

Recording: (2745/ 9621) 
that way at least we could move around a little bit but uh 

Recording: (2746/ 9621) 
when i started dating it almost seventeen um so now i think i think you learn a lot from your family and the way their relationships are um i i personally do not think a school can do it 

Recording: (2747/ 9621) 
you know i mean i like earl bruce and i uh waited on him a couple of times at a restaurant i worked out he was a nicest man and when they did that i do not know if you know about that one they fired him the day before the michigan game for having a nine to three season three years in a row they fired him the day before that game 

Recording: (2748/ 9621)

oh is it really have you been there 

Recording: (2750/ 9621)

Recording: (2752/ 9621) 
no but i have i have two daughters and two sons and i heard my daughter is talking about they want to do something special for my sixty fifth birthday so they would given me a party on my sixties so i do not know what it is going to be but i think they will they they talked about something the way of a trip so maybe something the three of us can do together so i am just 

Recording: (2753/ 9621) 
not at all 

Recording: (2754/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2755/ 9621) 
i do not remember which in unaherica they actually probably sell 

Recording: (2756/ 9621) 
whatever you going to get away with 

Recording: (2757/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2758/ 9621) 
humum 

Recording: (2759/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (2760/ 9621) 
i went to it is the new high school there 

Recording: (2761/ 9621) 
i i have gone to one but i had a back problem that is how dealt with it and it worked 

Recording: (2762/ 9621) 
um i do not i mean there definitely is that image of you know dallas and dimes d i think it is it is worse i think for the the image of the taurus like basically they think anyone who can afford to be over there must be absolutely loaded you know and that was sort of another thing when you know i went to school there is you know i had a scholarship that is how i went there you know and i worked the whole time i was in high school and college and all this kind of thing but it was just like you know people just thought oh you are american you are here therefore you must have lots of extra money to throw around and you know they just sort of do not grasp the fact that you know you can have made sacrifices to be there but i do think also in some you know i remember actually being in bristol that some california with brad is hendly lewis and you know they are on the trail or in everything else and you know their accent and and i remember a bunch of people were sitting in this sort of wound room watching this and they felt like oh you know something like is that what they talk like or is that what it is like in the south and i thought oh my gosh you know what an image you know what like the south and you know i was just kind of shocked at the but i think that there you know with you know people who are going to university there and things like that there is not necessarily that opinion maybe you know in a certain sector like when all you have heard is the consumption and everything else there might be more of that idea but i think you know most people like me or whatever they they well i should not say like but you know people who have more education sort of not even without having to really think about it but you know there is not just that blatant view i mean i think that it is um the consumption thing like i think a lot more realized now that you know i think americans have this just reputation which is totally true for like spending spending spending and like obviously when you give those people their look at so many people are in debt i mean i think i just saw something else in the news that said you know across the board we do not even break even we are like negative one or something 

Recording: (2763/ 9621) 
oh you are kidding 

Recording: (2764/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (2765/ 9621) 
people drive by looking around the little house there in the middle of the house at all but 

Recording: (2766/ 9621) 
but it is another thing that they are in their own in their house where the parents are every night and not going into garage and finding things 

Recording: (2767/ 9621)

Recording: (2800/ 9621) 
hm i did not realize that 

Recording: (2801/ 9621) 
especially if you are waiting to go on the combat 

Recording: (2802/ 9621) 
i think that is too young to talk about birth control nothing and everything but you know with aids in that it is rampant as it is now and there is so many more women that have it um started off with mostly men uh women have got to as at an early age you know about these different diseases and things 

Recording: (2803/ 9621) 
i remember a time when i was brand new teacher i would maybe fifth or sixth year teaching that is still pretty new this john i said john what is your last name he said guess i said i do not feel like guessing tell me your last name he said guess i said i do not feel like guessing telling me your last name he said guess i said john i want to know your last name and he said g u e s s umhum i am like oh sorry thank you 

Recording: (2804/ 9621) 
you know as a part of the reason but 

Recording: (2805/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2806/ 9621) 
but in the winter is when you know i am in on exercise that much 

Recording: (2807/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2808/ 9621) 
it is a no it is a uh clinical study where we are seeing how treadmill training affects the same violation and people just about have quite injee 

Recording: (2809/ 9621) 
i appreciate your opinions but were you asking did you have we seen a change in the politicians and through our lifetime was that a particular point 

Recording: (2810/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2811/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (2812/ 9621) 
how uh do you think there is a heaven 

Recording: (2813/ 9621) 
i think it is harder on him because he is demanding of my attention and i think that is a little harder because he was an only child for nearly five years so but it is been an investment for him but he loves his baby brother uh it is it is really he he nurses them too so that is neat to watch 

Recording: (2814/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2815/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2816/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2817/ 9621) 
yeah i have i have always lived in columbus yeah 

Recording: (2818/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2819/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (2820/ 9621) 
i went to ou for about three months but i was just got out of school you know to 

Recording: (2821/ 9621) 
i would just tell him that is just a feeling he is gone to you he you know i i have went to that where you know you you look at a woman and you are you she is attractive to you know but that is just something that is going through your mind and i think that is like the devil getting into because i would never sleep with a woman i would never do it even though i might be really would have been real drunk or you know or not drunk and just you know i would just tell him that is something he is going through and that is wrong for him to do that and he you know he is a man and that would tell him god did not put too many men on the earth and if he would still choose to do that that i would not hate him or this own one or anything like that 

Recording: (2822/ 9621) 
the opportunity to serve one another and uh that is the downfall of our society because we are thinking more of ourselves as as others others and i think as as we have become older you start thinking about how uh much your witnesses are but really your witnesses are the strength you pull from your faith it is not the materialistic things that the university here uh professors to be the thing 

Recording: (2823/ 9621) 
i know and you know and the thing is you are going to have a a great time with their kids and it is just it is it is it is almost like if it had to be like that for me to realize that and have it like this it is worth it 

Recording: (2824/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (2825/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (2826/ 9621) 
i do it so 

Recording: (2827/ 9621) 
he will basic you know he will basically tell you he do not have any father except for me 

Recording: (2828/ 9621) 
well i 

Recording: (2829/ 9621) 
well as it turned out he expected us to play the solo  but we did not play the whole piece we only played one movement of it and uh i thought it came out pretty well i have it recording of it for a while there i was worried that we did not get recording of it and i was really upset  

Recording: (2830/ 9621) 
right you you you can not really ignore i have heard people say i refuse to read it as a matter of the time so you do not know what is going on locally i am sorry but uh 

Recording: (2831/ 9621) 
and so that is a whole different that is real different from the way it used to be even though it looks the same 

Recording: (2832/ 9621) 
yeah up on down the floor of 

Recording: (2833/ 9621) 
if if you did not own let us say on the school i mean you did not you pay taxes i always because i rent and i always get very upset and i am very angry when people say well you do not have to pay school taxes yes i do because every time a school tax passes my rent goes up it is built into the rent uh at least it it ought to be or i have a pretty dumb landlord  uh and i do not i have never lived any place where my rent did not go up after school levy passed and usually in direct proportion and beyond you know uh of what the levy was uh so that would be the first thing i would say and then i would also say that you know uh because i i a number of reasons that people do not vote for school at least now is because they do not have kids in the schools you know but education is the foundation of a democracy and if you do not have an educated citizenry uh your democracy could go down the drain um that was why thomas jefferson founded so many schools or you know the the university of virginia and believed in education you know because he said without an educated citizen you will not understand the issues you know but it is very difficult today to get to people um i have talked to some uh almost college age students and they do not see the relationship you can talk a logic to them all you want and it is not like the logic gets to them and you can talk history all you want and it does not mean anything to them and i do not know why i wish i did but i do not know why 

Recording: (2834/ 9621) 
i had considered that yes 

Recording: (2835/ 9621) 
umhum yeah i well i think basically that goes back to uh you know the parenting and everything you know there is something missing in the uh uh the child is life you know uh that he was not getting perhaps attention uh those kids in particular i do not understand how they could be building bonds and been your basement and mom and dad do not know what were going on you know i mean uh it was just a trying i had a friend when i was a kid too that uh uh we were like i do not know uh eleven years old or something like that well it was accidental shooting and then and then uh uh another friend of mine from the same same class you know uh he pulled guns shot him you know and did not know that the anything was lived at but and they were talking about another thing about that you know where some kid i guess that happened just here in town or a couple of them that we could give or something to you know or a guy shot another guy but i mean those things are just sensless crimes really uh and he is really he is a fault and he is really he is guilty i do not know uh i would like to have uh the not state ever would have but if they one of the two that uh colombine you know if they would have survived i would like to see them that was going through their heads you know but that is something we would never know 

Recording: (2836/ 9621) 
she did not she did not say anything i mean they would not let her 

Recording: (2837/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2838/ 9621) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (2839/ 9621) 
yeah well there is too many situations out there to have everybody fit into certain ones it is just everyone of them is different 

Recording: (2840/ 9621) 
what is different uh my old neighborhood is just exactly the same and so from that angle was i mean still is my elementary school is sitting there i went to for nine years and then north is not being used as a high school but it is there a block away oh and ten she believe i am right in where i always sweat i mean i am i was raised on cuomo avenue and i live two blocks away from there now so i made a full full circle there but columbus has changed in the downtown area and it is really neat you know compared to any other cities course i am i loved oregon i was very rural for eighteen years 

Recording: (2841/ 9621) 
oh uhhuh 

Recording: (2842/ 9621) 
it is in in education it is it is top they produce a lot of graduate and undergraduate uh education basically in schools coming up like they are building a new building but by i will be gone by the time if it is done if i decide to stay so it it will be so as far as uh education like for small school and they just open up with their phd program in education and they are also known for political science but it is a real conservative political science and they get the real conservative school and that does not really match my my views on a lot of things uh the it is dry they have a real strict visitation policies things like that and my son is if you are if you are if you are considering it dull enough to move away then you should not have that many restrictions i can understand some because i remember in as a freshman in college it was we did crazy things but still 

Recording: (2843/ 9621) 
the south pacific yeah 

Recording: (2844/ 9621) 
you need you on the way around 

Recording: (2845/ 9621) 
i think that i do not think the divorce is the bad thing i think that it is if you are married and you realize that you get to a point where you and this other person are are not an positive relationship for each other or for anybody else in your family that it is better to just say this is not working we both deserve to be happy and we and and and and go your own separate ways um i think that i i think for me personally i would certainly i would certainly try very hard to be in a situation where i would not end up getting divorced just because i think it makes things on a lot bit more difficulty as far as like colorating things and i know that sounds kind of pettydy but just um but i i i mean i do not think it is i do not think it is bad but i think that that if you can find a way obviously to continue to make a relationship work that you should but my parents are very different 

Recording: (2846/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2847/ 9621) 
everyone loses their funding 

Recording: (2848/ 9621) 
and then said well since you are getting that we will cut cut your pay back to what you would normally draw under the on the printed program 

Recording: (2849/ 9621) 
i think yeah especially the seasons 

Recording: (2850/ 9621)

Recording: (2851/ 9621) 
right she she is interested in physical therapy as i better watch her wife is  oh okay 

Recording: (2852/ 9621) 
it was not a huge shock it was not my first encounter with home of security 

Recording: (2853/ 9621) 
yeah i mean i can not say that they would be any difference with them 

Recording: (2854/ 9621) 
just mount tapes uh do print out the monitor systems uh if people have problems they will solve them 

Recording: (2855/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (2856/ 9621) 
and you notice how they keep changing packages of your favorite article they have gone down there um i said but when you get down to the meat of it it is the same thing and i said and that is where it comes down to the cafeteria church for example they can put all you can foot masses you can go all this superficial stuff on the thing to make it more attracted and they do every every religion that makes it more attracted for oh is using whether come from oh yeah but the bomb line is you are trying to still if you are christian focused back to the bible 

Recording: (2857/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2858/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (2859/ 9621) 
and then there was another girl who i really did not think was that smart she is kind of um in her blonde and she got in yeah 

Recording: (2860/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (2861/ 9621)

Recording: (2862/ 9621) 
you can find it all over the place 

Recording: (2863/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (2864/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2865/ 9621) 
can you went ahead and did it so 

Recording: (2866/ 9621) 
so uh it is been talking away from sharing to come upon to that 

Recording: (2867/ 9621) 
he was from brooklyn 

Recording: (2868/ 9621) 
oh  

Recording: (2869/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (2870/ 9621) 
my 

Recording: (2871/ 9621) 
it is weird i i wish they would make it i do not want to save the well i think they do make it free um and i hate to say that but a bit easier access um because i do not think it will cause people to have more sex i think they are going to have it anyhow so it would only be better and safer for them 

Recording: (2872/ 9621) 
oh we do too we make vegetable soup and chili 

Recording: (2873/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2874/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2875/ 9621) 
you know what i mean 

Recording: (2876/ 9621) 
to some extent yeah but to some extent now because see what i was in the service it was a different 

Recording: (2877/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2878/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2879/ 9621) 
 really 

Recording: (2880/ 9621) 
you have spelled every name you have read every name you have written every name practically there are not any that you have not heard of 

Recording: (2881/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (2882/ 9621) 
yeah well 

Recording: (2883/ 9621) 
i do believe i do believe and i think maybe uh last you was you are one of the younger generation have not you had as you have grown older have not you looked back sometimes that boy mom was right about that dad was right about that i think the older a child gets and that includes us too now that we are our age because we are i am almost as old as my mother was not she died i am older than my father was when he died i do beatly i see now where just living life you keep your eyes in ears open in your mind you are going to have your mind opened to receive what you are watching your is  i guess um you learn things that you cannot possibly learn in a book in school they help they help you to teach this you should always keep your mind open in school but there is a lot of things you are just not going to learn except by actually experience and living life and i believe that that is a lot of her i know i started to say well you know i do not think i finished it i myself have these ones getting only what i need versus all these little once in these hours because i grew up in depression and did not have these things consequently i have got a dog collection that had a very collection an angel collection record collection you would not believe a whole one whole wall of my room with books and books in another room they have been the books i started them when the kids were little because they did read at home and the library is were not near as easy to get to as they are nowadays and consequently i have kept the books and it is amazing but some of those grandchildren almost all of them can order their house they get bored to a board to a book they will go to that book these and that book cajun is trying to look them for something to read so it is good to have it available for them in the home to a certain extent however our one son is going to do have a he is got one room she is completely lined with books and a hall hallway part of it is just books and i do not know if the kids ever go and pick those up or not because they are always doing to the library so you think it is what is taught at home that really counts but we do not need all those material things and now i am sitting back and thinking well which one of my kids which one of my grandchildren are going to keep this or shall i have an auction and spend the money on travel you see what i mean you change your opinion is changed as you get older and you begin to look back i do not think i was ever spendthirt to the point that i did things foolishly some things i did do foolish but i mean you know on a overall basis 

Recording: (2884/ 9621) 
can you up and light feed them and 

Recording: (2885/ 9621)

the ultimate would probably be a part type thing you know but neither one of our positions offer any type of part time work we have some friends that do that where they only go two days a week or something which is they get a little bit of both the world so 

Recording: (2926/ 9621) 
uh she is always trying to recruit people to come and visit but it is like a two hour drive and then everybody is busy you know that is four hours of driving and um i do not know it is just too hard to keep everybody in touch that way but 

Recording: (2927/ 9621) 
humum i was at u children and i was not even in u children it was a hundred thousand you know and uh i loved that but i then i came back and i live in oldentown she village which is right on the river and it is very uh very scenic very beautiful 

Recording: (2928/ 9621) 
yes umhum yeah i do miss that but at the same time i have you know i had a lot of opportunity to be there and to do those things so and i mean they are they are our you know it is obviously you can not compare it but you know they are our cultural things to doing columbus and it does sort of make me mad when you know people are kind of like oh climbers you know there is nothing to do there i find myself defending columbus a lot more now than 

Recording: (2929/ 9621) 
home back um yeah i am sure that was useful for people that did not cook or do anything showed them how to turn the oven on or 

Recording: (2930/ 9621) 
umhum that was in sixty nine is when i went in so you know you can kind of figure that it was the 

Recording: (2931/ 9621) 
oh  

Recording: (2932/ 9621) 
because there is no fear being caught by the parents there is 

Recording: (2933/ 9621) 
um so they sort of send them on their way or whatever and she did have the opportunity to come back 

Recording: (2934/ 9621) 
it is 

Recording: (2935/ 9621) 
hm 

Recording: (2936/ 9621) 
exactly exactly 

Recording: (2937/ 9621) 
there is no issue 

Recording: (2938/ 9621) 
and to me that is considered suburban so and to me ashe is considered the sticks i mean there is people there is onish buggy is that go by 

Recording: (2939/ 9621) 
ah i can not i can not believe it they came back 

Recording: (2940/ 9621) 
umhum umhum 

Recording: (2941/ 9621) 
i talk to her every day 

Recording: (2942/ 9621) 
well i am lucky in that way because um i get to travel a lot and it and so you know if there is something i really want to see chicago is not that far washington is not that far uh new york uh you know i do not get to new york that often but uh you know i mean i i still have access to a lot of stuff if i want to go to the trouble 

Recording: (2943/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2944/ 9621) 
so that is that is frustrating for me when you look at both of the candidates and you think i do not want either one of these people there should be another thing above you know if there is that option i am sure a lot more 

Recording: (2945/ 9621) 
be in turn to way 

Recording: (2946/ 9621) 
uh his daughter is twelve 

Recording: (2947/ 9621) 
ah probably 

Recording: (2948/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (2949/ 9621) 
but now it seems like people are just they i do not know why that is a trend i mean my dad said uh he grew up in the bronx 

Recording: (2950/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (2951/ 9621) 
that is 

Recording: (2952/ 9621) 
so i almost bought one um oh black couple weeks ago in fact i went i went into contract on it with this guy this dear old man who is it was for his mother who was in their nineties and a retirement was on the rural forest which is north and i made this this slow offer and i never thought that they would i did not want it was kind of like i felt like i had to do this because i if i was going to get this house i should get it but i did not really want now because i the baby coming and we are going to be busy and i did not want to get involved in and so i made this offer and then he turned her back you know i offered him ninety two and he was asking ninety nine so he came back in ninety six and i said uh you know i felt well i am going to have to worry about him he is never going to come to so i wrote back and said you know i appreciate your number but ninety two i ninety two is is almost not feasible for me and ninety two five was really the only thing i could i could do and i did not even give him the time to respond because i just assumed i was just bowing out of it 

Recording: (2953/ 9621) 
um i think it is probably more social but i mean obviously they are going to have different views on how things work uh but i mean for the most part i can not see that as being too big of a problem uh obviously there are more like violent guys out there and things like that than there are women but at the same time i would not say there is anything too over powerful as far as the number of guys being out there or by on i mean it is something that unfortunately does happen but i mean it is more higher brought up whether you can control it or not 

Recording: (2954/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (2955/ 9621) 
oh that is almost as bad as rosy becausey i have a 

Recording: (2956/ 9621) 
um yeah 

Recording: (2957/ 9621) 
oh just it was going down like 

Recording: (2958/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2959/ 9621) 
um and you kind of knew everybody around the neighborhood but i think that that still that is still the same for the neighborhood that my family lives on um so i do not think i me personally other than other than the fact that maybe there is a couple more things to do there is bigger and more comfortable movie theaters and and that kind of stuff it has not really 

Recording: (2960/ 9621) 
but usually she is looking for something to eat you know 

Recording: (2961/ 9621) 
some times i think it is been a very bad influence on certain aspects of life on others i think it is been very good because at least let us us know what is going on in the rest of the world and if it were not for that some of the things we would not know and i think that is you increase your knowledge you are far better off  than to stay in this little hole here and this is all i want to know about 

Recording: (2962/ 9621) 
yeah they do 

Recording: (2963/ 9621) 
umhum parties did not change at all 

Recording: (2964/ 9621) 
well uh the first the first thing is clintonville 

Recording: (2965/ 9621) 
i just really think he is 

Recording: (2966/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (2967/ 9621) 
surely cool yeah yeah 

Recording: (2968/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (2969/ 9621) 
um i think they can help but i think it has to be something that society in general our family 

Recording: (2970/ 9621) 
put bathrooms and kitchens and stuff 

Recording: (2971/ 9621) 
i think columbus is really interesting how how it developed developed compared to uh like i do not know just like how in minneapolis like how columbus is different it is it is a a real standard midwest city just how it is designed and made out compared to like philadelphia you know or just like when it was settled and and when it was made just out like more the street is from war it is all like planned out more as opposed to like in in phillie or places like that more east coast it is like the roads parts of them are real small and like and other parts are all hilly and curving around and stuff and so it is kind of interesting i mean i think it is also i like the urban for all of the problem is how um this is the suburbs develop and how it is more of a metropolitan area as opposed to a centralized area that is really big like our like corner downtown is really odd too i mean there is nothing to do down there it is all businesses and like the couple of shops that are down there close to like six i mean there is like a couple restaurants or something but i mean it is it is different when you think of other cities you know it is more of like a downtown is where you go to hang out but here it is like campus and it is more and more of uh 

Recording: (2972/ 9621) 
but i mean it was nothing too serious or violent i mean 

Recording: (2973/ 9621) 
so everybody is trying to be like everyone else 

Recording: (2974/ 9621) 
oh you do not ask it easy one do you  that is that is really 

Recording: (2975/ 9621) 
and they do not wear like the lot of the way in shirts and and you know the shorts and the camera is that that they do they do they say they um do they 

Recording: (2976/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (2977/ 9621) 
yeah not that they could have stopped it but they they should have known what was going on uh i really think if they were close with their children they would have known something was wrong especially with these kids they are so removed and do not talk to their parents and start dressing certain way you know that they are you know going uh turning a different  you know i just i blame them then they will 

Recording: (2978/ 9621) 
yeah i hear 

Recording: (2979/ 9621) 
yeah which is good to make it i do not ever give it or anything so 

Recording: (2980/ 9621) 
and you do not have to worry if she writes her name backwards like a mirror image 

Recording: (2981/ 9621) 
and then once a month we will have a leadership module which is uh the business ethic part and you know say go setting and that type thing and then once a month we will just have like tonight who is the people and like just just general things like events coming up we had we planned the farce of nearfield last weekend in the weekend before i do not know i can not wait for it to start just because i wanna watch it on tv and i point it out  you see that the jack nicholas golfs do not you in front of but golf at all i just want to turn it on and see it occasionally 

Recording: (2982/ 9621) 
nobody around not in atlanta yeah there is one she has and there is still like that so i know ah my car is not like that 

Recording: (2983/ 9621) 
i would not 

Recording: (2984/ 9621) 
yeah i do i really do i mean these kids are getting guns a lot of them is from their parents but um it is amazing how many guns and they say that the police are selling guns to people and they do not realize you know their old guns that they concentrate and they do not realize where they are going i mean that am amazes me uh but there is always going to be the under world in different ways that kids and people can get guns and it is sad i do not know how we could ever limit that but there is so many millions of guns in the world that you know you are wondering where are they all coming from um i think but i think laws can help especially with children and they have these new guns that um not just the safety lock but you know you it is like identification thing you know 

Recording: (2985/ 9621) 
oh really 

Recording: (2986/ 9621) 
oh how is the football game deal 

Recording: (2987/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2988/ 9621) 
and yet we sit down and negotiate for it and then on top of the those people that participate in the um sponsors are just as bad 

Recording: (2989/ 9621) 
excuse me well typically what i have is they are stepfather involved you know that becomes a problem for some of them but they said you know you might run into a case where you know the family is abusing uh the child you know but i did not run into that 

Recording: (2990/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (2991/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (2992/ 9621) 
that is why it is mainly appealing to people you they pay you to go to school 

Recording: (2993/ 9621) 
you know and they did want the children 

Recording: (2994/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (2995/ 9621) 
this falls the first time i will be so many people you know 

Recording: (2996/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (2997/ 9621) 
 uh no i do really believe that they it they would have something like that instead of some of these even those shows they are not good even for older people to watch they aggravate me sometimes i turn them off for some the stupid things they do 

Recording: (2998/ 9621) 
great yeah it was like oh just makes sense and you might have these other wonderful things that i am used to but he is got all of this so i will get that little slice and take the rest so that worked out 

Recording: (2999/ 9621) 
to watching it for a while period and then since dspay is the night last they needed a little star trek fix every once in a while so i started watching it i actually do not have cable so uh it is on upn and fifty three does not come in terribly well so it uh i mean sometimes it is like i do not want to kind of see what is going on but 

Recording: (3000/ 9621) 
i was interesting going out to california and i have been up this several times but it was supposed to be tight uh why was it on you and i just did not move in with my mother 

Recording: (3001/ 9621)

Recording: (3004/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (3005/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (3006/ 9621) 
which you look at it as as a sport 

Recording: (3007/ 9621) 
yeah yeah because if she was they are charging her two bucks down there and i told her i said you need to really not get twenty dollars out of the time because i said you need to get like sixty or eighty because since you get eighty bucks out you are going to pay eight dollars for it twenty bucks at a time but if you get eighty bucks out you are going to get two bucks and she goes but if i had eighty dollars i will spend it and i says well you have a foot lock or the lock on it put seventy dollars in there and have ten and she is like oh and i said the only reason i know that is because that is what dad is got to do  i said i can not carry money or i spend it you know 

Recording: (3008/ 9621) 
they he remembers he he he remembers the stepfather is and and that kind of thing and just not a good stepfather 

Recording: (3009/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (3010/ 9621) 
they are just fun to go on strike anytime they want to over how they behave during the strike was just disgusting i mean 

Recording: (3011/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (3012/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (3013/ 9621) 
like five or six different doctors and so she is learned a lot more now the cancer because she is never been in on college yet also it was always just drama patients or open heart and bite past patients and things like that so it is been a whole new learning experience for her too 

Recording: (3014/ 9621) 
but 

Recording: (3015/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (3016/ 9621)

Recording: (3019/ 9621) 
um i am a lutheran and a lot of what he says about everyone going to hell 

Recording: (3020/ 9621) 
uh yeah so i think she is getting a better education than he did but that is because she is doing the work and she knows she is expected to in the past and he my son is the kind he would rather play than work and so he he wrote a lot and 

Recording: (3021/ 9621) 
that is it oh 

Recording: (3022/ 9621) 
i was up i was on the on the old few times but one time we had a uh secondly two ten out up there who was very uh continual i guess has got aware of any

umhum 

Recording: (3029/ 9621)

Recording: (3030/ 9621) 
yeah yeah i think it was just a political thing 

Recording: (3031/ 9621) 
no i park over here on uh let me see the a section goes back in 

Recording: (3032/ 9621) 
like there would be kids saying yes maam yes maam yes maam in class and then they are out there smoking at the cars or cat school and stuff  

Recording: (3033/ 9621) 
you know it takes like years i would think to implement the program successfully 

Recording: (3034/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (3035/ 9621) 
umhum life skills  

Recording: (3036/ 9621)

Recording: (3037/ 9621) 
 i said i think there is no there is no light year they could really do with that  

Recording: (3038/ 9621) 
oh then you would not be too familiar with anything or 

Recording: (3039/ 9621)

Recording: (3043/ 9621) 
umhum uh they have a whole listening of numbers of reasons why you do not want to do it and most usually i just put location i do not want to go to certain places uh 

Recording: (3044/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3045/ 9621) 
i i think it is because uh when i was a sophomore in high school before it done done me that to have a and flat b in a relation to this stuff that we were learning with the starts in the paragraphs and um but i think kids are a lot more aware now from because of what they are exposed to you know in movies and everything and you know just tv just daily life um i they are a lot more aware they they have i they they go and i think they i think they need to know 

Recording: (3046/ 9621) 
yeah like when i need things and i call them up i need diapers and they wipe i need twenty dollars yeah he is there for me the for that financially uh he is always been there for me 

Recording: (3047/ 9621) 
with her eye or the car actually 

Recording: (3048/ 9621) 
like on the fair they regular basis even 

Recording: (3049/ 9621) 
yeah it is well basically it is like a it is about the size of a small hotel room and then it is got separate bathroom with like a big back tub and there is like these are like going to room it there upy which is a little box on the wall about this bag that has like some smelly stuff coming out of it but i mean there is no enough room where people can come in sit down there is like a full out couch bed for whoever is in there with you and then they have got the baby they keep the baby right there in the room with you after it is born 

Recording: (3050/ 9621) 
it was during school um you would go there uh you would went there for two years you would junior and senior year and um like your junior did you go in the morning and your senior year and afternoon but it took up pretty much your whole day half of your day actually you are at the cruise center then you go 

Recording: (3051/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (3052/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3053/ 9621) 
just because you know it was more like they seem like they wanted to be there as opposed to i am just doing this because i do not know why or whatever and it seems like too they they i hate it when people it is obvious that if they did not have the tax book they would not know how to do it you know like where if people did not have their notes like they would not be able to do it themselves you know it is kind of like um so i think it it is it and when people have real enthusiasm like you know and put a lot of effort into making it not the same every day not just like a lecture and then we do whole homework and turn it in like you know it is like we do like i guess history class we do like role role playing things and like 

Recording: (3054/ 9621) 
yeah exactly which is one of the things that ran to our architecture where i mean we only had you know one or two papers we had to write 

Recording: (3055/ 9621)

Recording: (3060/ 9621) 
they just can not think of out what i should attend to and what i should screen out so they attend to everything we equally the train going by out here the teacher talking up here the kid over here shuffing up his pencil and so they get a little bit of everything and they do not learn anything 

Recording: (3061/ 9621) 
and there is people who are like that today still you know but i think people should go to uh retirement centers uh uh and uh sit down and make a visit to them every week make a part of their life and give up a friendship 

Recording: (3062/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (3063/ 9621)

Recording: (3102/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (3103/ 9621)

and it really is not though because once because i think it is actually it is really free not to have to drink and all these things so you just kind of i feel like i can go on with any people and so it does not really exclude you from anyone unless you would let it i guess and it will be perfect i mean everybody has their prejudices i guess and fears so getting over that is is part of life  for everyone 

Recording: (3109/ 9621) 
oh yeah uh 

Recording: (3110/ 9621)

Recording: (3112/ 9621)

Recording: (3113/ 9621) 
anyly 

Recording: (3114/ 9621) 
and uh it does not hurt may not you know uh i think it just depends upon like i said a lot of factors you know what your neighborhood your neighbors uh most kids do not have nothing to do in their neighborhood you you know how many amy lots do you see nowadays it still comes back to like when i was a kid we had go parts we had many bikes we had all that kind of stuff 

Recording: (3115/ 9621) 
there is a lot more in college college it is seven nights a week 

Recording: (3116/ 9621) 
umhum and some conservative values too you know that the republicans are supposed uh rep aies uh but i do not think they they are doing a very good job of that  

Recording: (3117/ 9621) 
i it gets not a presidential issue canada issue as far as i am concerned but uh i am 

Recording: (3118/ 9621) 
you would not have even stopped he is sitting there going what are you doing with this guy in the way is he on my car and all this stuff and i said i want him arrested man he took my neck was trying to take my radio too and uh you know i can not do that in there to make it sound bad but  i was on my way to work man i did not want anything bad to happen to me or him you know so all in all the you know put guy in hand cut put it in back the car and he goes well do you want to press charges and at that so i am a little bit over my limit with the anger thing and said now just let them out of the car i will be that you know um man the cop said something is i never forget he said i would but that would probably have to be my job to do if we was living like that  i was like god you need to write me getting all over again  

Recording: (3119/ 9621) 
i do not see you reading for it myself but uh it is interesting uh uh you know when they when they first when they uh time began you know of course in life uh what i believe and then everything you know was man on one and got married you know and and the reason they got married just because of proagreeation you know keep the keep the uh population going uh i think that is the way it was set up originally so i had no problem with the man being with the man or one of being with the woman but uh it if that was the relationship for everybody 

Recording: (3120/ 9621) 
letterly instinct you know and they are like oh very nice you should have one and you know and he knows on the cat one um i just knew at a young age i have always loved the animals

Recording: (3122/ 9621) 
see and i can not eat seafooded but i tried some once where i went to las vegas with my dad and i we did not really have it my mom did not cook it at home which i am kind of glad she did not um the it is not fish always kind of bothered me but until i tried some crab meat lobster and within five minutes i broke out into a rash i mean it was like a heat rash 

Recording: (3123/ 9621) 
you know so i figure it is it is much better to be nice to them because there is also times when you know everybody makes errors and you know maybe one of these times you make an error and i tell you to turn one way and you go uh you know there is an airplane over there and i tell you to turn that way and i really meant for you to turn left instead of right and you may come back go and you you mean left or right there and i go yes that is a correct turn left you know you know so you know everybody helps everybody out you know i i feel kind of goes a long way and the pilots the same way they are most often they are you know pretty decent 

Recording: (3124/ 9621) 
well i used to 

Recording: (3125/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (3126/ 9621) 
yeah uh it to to me that sort of a slap on the wrist and you tell the parents what you have done it that the kid did and you do not want him to do it again and let it go they suspended it i do not know of course um i will probably say this i got this version of this story from the columbus this bad so it is probably not the whole story yeahyeah it it 

Recording: (3127/ 9621) 
it is that is why i quit 

Recording: (3128/ 9621) 
 we do not have one at home because we are worried they  

Recording: (3129/ 9621)

Recording: (3130/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (3131/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (3132/ 9621) 
yeah i mean that is pretty much what we have made to do you know back in the pioneer days he did not have this crap with the kid going get gives me some can ravially or you gave that kid a shotgun and he went out there and killed his own  that is an interesting thing i just saw in the paper in the newsweek i was reading that and 

Recording: (3133/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (3134/ 9621) 
and psychology 

Recording: (3135/ 9621) 
which i feel has been completely divorced in america because of the effects of the cold war uh i going with this  umi mean the generation before us had like vietnam they protest against it i mean they were in many ways participating into the generation before but i mean when it came down to it i mean the what was the protest really about you know and i am not being clear because i am not exactly sure where i am going but i am very cynical up uh about the about the world i have inherited uh because i see a world in which my political views have been silence by fifty years of of you know the international politics uh in sort of like propaganda uh that says you know it to be left of a certain point is bad i i do not know like among conservative circles the word liberal is is like  almost like calling so and a communist in in the forties um where it i am very cynical about that because they they feel that it was not it it is been a cultural process that has been developed and now i am being handed this current situation which i see is completely unfair i mean i think the reason that our generation is cynical the reason i am cynical is because we are handed a world in which we see the injusticeices of the past or not the the the hypoc the i mean it gets in justice it also applies in terms of things like the cold war and stuff but that is why i am cynical i hope that answers your question in at least a little bit i do not know they feel kind of pretty  like this is my position 

Recording: (3136/ 9621) 
taking classes hopefully that is when you go to the dentist and you know you catch up on all that stuff too

right 

Recording: (3141/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (3142/ 9621) 
have to run with thewell personally i voted that the thirty thirty three should have happened they should have way i and understone they and they have a way to worry there is this check check check for a hundred and three hundred and three hundred and three hundred and three hundred and three hundred and three hundred and three hundred and three the pollution they enter in the house and i said you know i said you know uh airlines you say that they are reteeling something with the past i think four two years ago it was allowing things to be done up around the floor of their area and you have frozen and then that and i loved that and everything because i do not think we should be holding anybody i do not do that and taking the money away from this or thati have a very general uh opposition to this kind of thing uh no matter where it is anymore uh my being seventy six years of age has a major bearing because i see the total restriction of our center cities uh and i say when i speak of center cities i do not necessarily mean just cities the size of columbuswood is the largest one of the sayable highland now but i am talking places like washington cour house which may be have fifteen thousand or uh uh wadsworth which may be have eighteen thousand uh this kinds of thing is being developed on the peripheral of the cities is just totally destroying those and of consequence i feel it is breaking our society down to the point where we do not do not know our neighbors at all anymore that uh it is quite common anymore that if you go three houses down you have no idea who those folks are how they feel what they might do for you or you can do for them uh and that all applies to the poorest question as i see it and i think also that uh it it is a very very major financial uh gain for the developer who are doing it and it is going to therefore harm uh the many many areas that are affected such as north north north north north north north what is the name of the shop uh northwest northland yeah northern and i can not even they say that okay

Recording: (3176/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (3177/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (3178/ 9621) 
well i think they tried to get to some kind of a deal with uh when they were planning this thing with uh with the high state uh you know like had the shot by seens centered down at uh down closer to downtown or or something like uh and play happy ball games there or something like that but but on high state do not need to you know they got their own stuff so 

Recording: (3179/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3180/ 9621) 
well i do not think they should be responsible but i think um kids go to school and they need role models good teachers um and i think schools have gotten a lot better about that it seemed like in the late eighties early nineties you know the schools a lot of them were really bad uh i think finally the education department or whatever is realizing that parents need help with their kids they can not do everything and you know they just need really positive things when they do go to school and you know i think teachers are being part of it i really do you know you remember when you have a good teacher and that he is learned a lot um and i think you know through education because it is hard all these schools and so many rural areas and everything trying to get good teachers and then you know it is the way it is has to do with money and them not making enough money which the teachers do not make enough money and they are over work and all these big large classroom it just seems to me one kid start dressing and getting it click together you know it would be hard for them to interview together you know it would be hard for them to intervene and say oh what is going on in your life what is your what is the problem you know that that is not really should be their role but uh if they care enough they should call the parents and they would look for word about your son he misses a lot of school or he is starting to dress really you know uh sometimes then it should not be the dress has a lot to do with them but it seems when kids go a different way it does involve dress and just you know turning against the norm of the society you know and if they do not want to be in sports that is fine there is so many different things that they can do in in school in learning about arts and music and you know but um unfortunately i think a lot more pressure is on schools to more or less pick up this lack of what the parents can not do but in some ways it is always kind of been like that i mean it was like he went to school and they took care of me until he got home you know i mean 

Recording: (3181/ 9621) 
getting so ingested that is one i do not like 

Recording: (3182/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (3183/ 9621) 
and it is like i i like how see i got thought about going to antiac but it it was really expensive and like um i do not know but just because it is that and and schools more of uh nonsraditional uh type where they give you like evaluate and you do not get grades like and so so then it that is what that is what i heard is like in indians where the professor rates uh like a couple of page paper on your like performance is on the quarter and that that really shows that i mean that is a lot of work for the professor but like that really shows that he is really involved and noticing what you are doing as opposed to just like uh some kid in his class you know 

Recording: (3184/ 9621) 
well there is been quite a change in the attitude of general public i think as far as right women working away from home is concerned and uh they do not knowuh was able to work there at home well actually she worked in an office when our first boy was just small 

Recording: (3185/ 9621)

i do not know uh maybe it i think if teachers just their status in society is not real high when it should be um it is more like you know have heard that like garbage men get paid more than teachers you know and how but it um so it is just like people always talk about you know education for that you know we have got to like think about our child is future or whatever but really teachers are paid crap and like do not really get a lot of respect from anybody like professors and stuff get get like more of their respect but it is just like the like the teachers that you have especially in elementary school like in critical periods in in your life like in especially in out of less and still like really influenced like how you are as a person and like people do not like take that for granted a lot like if you have bad teachers in one subject you are gonna hate that subject you know unless you have good teachers you are gonna love it i mean they really influence it too like how like what you want to do with your life and and people is do not really have knowledge of that too much 

Recording: (3256/ 9621) 
um kind of uh i mean it was something i was really into uh until i do not know maybe about fourth or fifth grade at which point things of switch to you know like i do not like killer robot or something like transformers that kind of thing uh in high school i uh i do not know i think i cleaned my room or something or cleaned my closet and found my old toys and like star wars is fun i am going to watch star wars more often than it had them on tape so i started watching them on tape and i i do not want to say into it because i know people who are really into it i am pretty into it but it is not the same kind of thing i do not think but back when i started doing the the pay i i graduated from high school in ninety four just to put things in a little perspective uh so it was like my first couple of years at college from the third couple of years at college i just sort of the second half of high school to the first couple of years of college i just sort of 

Recording: (3257/ 9621)

that is that is really hard to say um if she was a younger woman and ran the campaign that she ran negatives do not work in columbus columbus really does have a heart and that just does not play in columbus what plays in the state and then the people who ran her campaign ran boyin manage is campaign and beat him on governmentamory is campaign and in that negative stuff worked statewide that does not work so well in columbus um i i think even a younger woman who ran that particular campaign would have lost um and i would like to think that age does not matter but she came across as old to me also and i like to think i am not prejudice on on any issue but if there is a someone who had been right on the issues i do not care if she was old i would have voted for her she just did not support the issues i supported he was wrong on on i i did not like that she tried to use um the police chief in such a negative way by saying that um coleman had voted for a raise for the chief well yes he voted for a raise for a chiefity voted for a raise for the the police officers it is just that you know the police chiefs was tied to his and i do not like people who try to manipulate the facts uh and and that was manipulating the back they did not like that she was um uh uh against the the the tiff uh impedous once it was voted i thought it was more important whether it was right or wrong and i do not think it was wrong to begin with but once it was voted and in place i thought our reputation was on the line for her to try to use another devices issue just to get elected did not sit well with me um so i do not even if she had a lot ofuism uh curriculum does not mean as much to me as a person is stand

i forgot i do myself so i got on some of my news groups and i am like uh i just can not help me oh no it is not that i hate michael so office i mean they have to do what they have to do i mean people people do not understand that software has to stay up to date on the minute where they get stuck under i mean they are they are operating systems that people have not even heard of that were uh staying in their days i mean a lot of people know what a common or sixty four is they have heard of it but they really do not know what a brilliantinian system it was that it is in it is initial stage and it just got bulled over because you know something better came out something better will come out than windows microsoft will eventually go under she is just gonna think a while oh yeah oh yeah i do not i gave it probably about six or seven years before before before somebody comes out with assistance just as good as microsoft lennon i do not know i think lennist a will be around forever just because it is such a stable system it is so good and yeah and macintosh will stay around forever just because macintosh is invincible uhumhum umhum after the big high for the high mac and it did not do as good as nearly as good as they thought it was going to do is not it do okay it is still around this is going to do as good as they thought it was going to do dumb around what idiot it does not put a three and a half drive on a computer that was stupid that was just dumb marketing that was dumb yeah umhumumhumthey are like did you call your manufacturer um like well probably would not do any good because there is not a whole lot left in my computer that is manufactured i mean i got a my phone i my network cards the case the only thing anymore that is original is the hard drive the city rome the three and a half the hundred twenty eight meg ram ship and the cpit it is the only thing that is factory anymore  no they probably would not um i am been in contact with a um day trading firm down in west virginia and they are starting an internal program sometime i do not even know when but if they if that opens up i will probably seriously consider going down to west virginia they are they are home basis in uh richmond virginia service down virginia okay they are home basis in richmond virginia and uh if they open up the internal program like i into the into the into the into the into the into i have loves them they are not a detroit i have always been good with them but where am i going in the future i do not know i know eventually i am going to go back to law school and get a law degree because i did i did mark trial in high school and i love it i love law actually absolutely love the law i am going to and um one of the lawyers that was being our judges that state um came up afterwards and gave me his business card and said if and when you get through law school give me a call  i was like kick and dooh keep that card  and make a phone call maybe he will be like a maybe he will be like stuff you know like being a a lawyer for somebody wants to see the crap out of another corporation oh plenty of money in that i do not want to be in the annual i do not want to be in the ambulance station i just want to be this will not be somebody that will screw all the big giants oh yeah yeah one giant will not screw to crap out of the other giant  

Recording: (3491/ 9621) 
but that is what they go sort of 

Recording: (3492/ 9621) 
well i did not necessarily want to but thats where my family started me out they um our alternative to the public schools supposedly um just more i do not know exactly how to explain it the only thing that i know is that i never learned to do anything  

Recording: (3493/ 9621) 
 um and that just sound like a broken record but i really think it is our uh back slide on on family unit i think it is too easy this day i and i have been married and divorced so i have unfortunately had that experience to me um that it is too easy to get divorced um people do not really go into marriage with commitment in lifetime and have that i do not want to say old fashions of the money but just the value of this is a very important uh because let us face it to me love is a choice because there is times when i do not love my husband i want to smacking and he is being a little barney but i would choose to be in love with him because i made that choice and then that passes along the whole uh hour later a week later we have whatever long it takes i am in love with them again i mean really you know what i am saying and um i think it is just too easy to get divorced i do not believe in staying in a marriage for the sake of with just children but i think if you really make that commitment and actually work on it you can have a great relationship you can have kids and bring them up in a more stable environment uh unfortunately i think that is the problem parents uh or they either getting divorced and then they get caught up in their petty little things and start putting face it like we said you know even having a dog takes some time out of your your your schedule and um and not spending enough time with the kids you know they are working whatnot and it and it takes a lot of effort to raise kids these days and actually listen to them and get to know them and let them grow and things like that um and i do not think enough families are doing that 

Recording: (3494/ 9621)

money is not everything it is too bad sports has ended up this way 

Recording: (3499/ 9621) 
or on your hard drive um because this really for all the world looks to me just like a rough drive or i will say to my students have your mom look it over have your sister look it over have somebody else prove read it because you are not going to see the mistakes because you are too busy thinking about the content of what you wanted to say and you are not going to notice them spelled t h i m or they t h a y yeah or a sentence that is too long or a sentence that is a frag and it is not a complete thought you are not going to notice that because you know what it was supposed to say so give it to a friend or somebody and let them just on your rough copy just let them circle anything they do not understand and that will really help you oh well i had a 

Recording: (3500/ 9621)

Recording: (3521/ 9621) 
and i have kids that say i do better when i listen to my music on it i do this is a please let me listen to my advantage but then they can not hear you when you say okay the time is up to stop now or whatever you are going and uh and yeah putke him  so i do not usually let the kids listen to their head fulls and maybe the last week of school in junior or something but or maybe right around christmas time but most of the time i do not because i get too out of touch with everything that is going on around and i do not have a like a regular size class like i do not have five six seven kids at a time and believe me when you got seven high perspective 

Recording: (3522/ 9621) 
yeah it was because i got it was because i got into a different i mean i had grown up with these people you know i hung out with all these people that were part of my youth group and and know hung out with them and hung out with them and i came to columbus and met a whole new group of people i mean every year i have been down here i have met another you know thousand people and they are all different every year they are all different people and i did not have them back home i keep meeting people and it is just really fascinating yeah he says unless flow of people you know like wow and man there gets some new looking people down here and this and good looking checks down here in columbus let me tell you  uh yeah my freshman year i went out with uh someone her name was she um she is the one that really got me into the uh what we call charismatic um christianity the christianity uh you know like the opposite of charismatic is the uh the serious old time cross noturex where they put numbers up on the wall and you open up you are heading it through those numbers you sing you stand up whenever you can not you stand up you sit down whenever i am telling you you sit down the arizona and then the protestant the uh sorry the um charismatic is the exact opposite of that when you think of caras man if you think of the black church is where there is also at the working plan and you know pays and you know hand is in the air and singing and dancing and people falling over and and she is she really introduced me to that um and then we date it for about three months and i both of us decided okay this is we accomplished what we we are supposed to accomplish this relationship you have introduced me to something and i have introduced you to something and now we are going to go separate weights and so we separated and then i found my current church and got plug in there and i met someone there uh that within two weeks of knowing me and dating me she said oh willie mery the person i am going to marry and that

Recording: (3534/ 9621)

you doing it i do tomatoes anyhow i will pay the extra higher price for the better ones but 

Recording: (3622/ 9621) 
yeah if you just put the computer in key to data base and or well the system we are doing now is you can put in like uh the address to your end for a webree source that goes out and the extract state analysis what is there and comes up the you know the subject terminology and call numbers and presents it back to you and then you can enter it and do whatever you want with it so you know it is it is doing some of that some of that the automatic finding of subjecting is not called numbers that is a lot of we are doing a lot of research on that it is got a ways to go it is getting even better 

Recording: (3623/ 9621) 
um i do not think that really matters honestly um i mean it is i mean by the time you get into boy scout it is usually eighth grade or something like that seventh eighth grade and up and i think by that time most kids have at least a general idea of who they are and what they like and do not like um i can not see i can not see them actually looking at like uh their leader or whatever as being too much of a rural model for your anymore um and then obviously it should be something that they respect but i can not say that they would be like oh well he does it so i am going to have to do it too or whatever 

Recording: (3624/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3625/ 9621) 
yeah they always maintained that uh back in the day uh dallas invader was the tragic hero the star wars thing it was not you know about like in a sense of blue sky walker in you know like grubbellion and

Recording: (3631/ 9621) 
yeah the protection 

Recording: (3632/ 9621) 
does not that get back more or less to the thing about everybody being meat meat now and therefore they really do not so much care about where they came from and what they are and who they are 

Recording: (3633/ 9621) 
or you know the things that we learned when we were kids because our mom taught them or we learned them at church in a game or something they all look at you like christopher robin who is that biglet who is that you know these there is a whole generation of kids now whose moms did not stay home and read them and all that fairy tale stuff and nursery ryan stuff they do not have a clue what you are talking about 

Recording: (3634/ 9621) 
well i think they got that all of the off of uh the tv i mean that influenced

right um at the age that they were 

Recording: (3636/ 9621) 
she said well you have to take a foreign language you have to i said look i am not taking any more foreign languages we are going to figure out how to avoid this or no you have to take a i said look what are there sixty thousand students in this university and if you think that i am going to believe for a second that they all take four language classes after having seen the college of foreign language during seeing there is another way to do this experience what is it well you have to do foreign language i said okay we are going to change the question a little bit here you have two afternoons just tell me how do a boy taking a four language well tell me how to talk to somebody who is not unke is that is apparently all i have gotten the feel that said well you have to talk to me as long as you are in this college it was like where is the for them 

Recording: (3637/ 9621) 
you are from where 

Recording: (3638/ 9621) 
i am not sure uh i am not sure that the the federal government has the ability to convince enough people to do it and i do not think it is is i think the people that are going to be ready to accept it and go with it are i do not think they are going to get good cross section of the population i think the people people being willing to understand it can go with it more or they can be the more educated in this sort of thing than you are leaving out a larger part of the population so i am not sure it is going to give out on results anyway 

Recording: (3639/ 9621) 
yeah yeah exactly it will last you are out there ones like yeah that is how beat does it but until then you are like okay this is ridiculous 

Recording: (3640/ 9621)

Recording: (3681/ 9621) 
was was they actually had a law or they or was they referrent them 

Recording: (3682/ 9621) 
um well one of the things i am doing is i am applying for a number of research grants to go to germany and continue my research so hopefully i will get one of those um nice thinking it pretty good shape to get one of those so uh that is that might cause me to put off grad school for a year but i do not think the grad schools will mind if i 

Recording: (3683/ 9621) 
my friends have have gone yeah what is their discipline is explaining the child from school well they are explaining them to a home where the parent is working where they are just getting three days a free play i mean pretty much to get in trouble and cause them our trouble they really are learning from that 

Recording: (3684/ 9621) 
tiger backbeats and stuff and like because i can not play baseball like a like like a processor thing and stuff that fool around was just doing stuff like that and some of my friends like play on drum machines and stuff like that so i just do stuff like that more like it is not it is not like you are playing right like you are not spending records just like you 

Recording: (3685/ 9621) 
so it is like each neighborhood is got a little different personality 

Recording: (3686/ 9621) 
yeah i have been uh you know forever pretty much i did not really have any other teams 

Recording: (3687/ 9621) 
subjective right 

Recording: (3688/ 9621) 
yeah just ridiculous amounts of stuff and like i do not know i do 

Recording: (3689/ 9621) 
theory is held in the house and needs to be helped not just you know uh well stick them in a place where they can just concentrate on it even more so we have got a long ways to go there 

Recording: (3690/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (3691/ 9621) 
i did have a job like that one i work full time 

Recording: (3692/ 9621) 
oh my dress of crazy 

Recording: (3693/ 9621) 
so it is hard for us to deal with 

Recording: (3694/ 9621) 
yeah uh and i can say there are some drugs that i do not really consider to be too threatening or that i am really too worried about people using uh i mean just the whole idea of the marijuana and things like that i mean it does not really bother me so much i mean cigarettes and alcohol basically do the same thing it does 

Recording: (3695/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (3696/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (3697/ 9621) 
 cake that away 

Recording: (3698/ 9621)

Recording: (3700/ 9621) 
i told him that he gets no guarantee that i will come back and in exchange i do not get health coverage while i am gone it just started giving me a call in the 

Recording: (3701/ 9621) 
and so i think i will probably end up changing i do not know what to it would probably be more towards the education line 

Recording: (3702/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3703/ 9621) 
whether if it is a written goal or not that is what they are doing

Recording: (3741/ 9621) 
right yeah i have run into just a few problems at and from uh since i do like the jogging though very slow most of the people that take their dogs there take them off the leash and let them go in the lake and what not which is okay you are not supposed to do that but when i am jogging with my dog and getting asian all the other dogs come up it irritates me 

Recording: (3742/ 9621) 
um no i got to babysit for like a week and then she has the best friend that is watching her baby and a friend of hers that has other kids too so it is real good for the baby

yeah the cards with the characters and they all have different powers the daughter has this thing called a pokey tax you know i do not mind what the monkey tax you know i bought that monkey tax you know we get this they it is a little computery open it up you print in the name of the person you want it puts up his picture tells you all the information about him what his powers are what you know it is just like mind pop yeah i did that is what it is of all the parking lot you know and i am just like you know no where it leads you know like is it any worse than baseball cards or you know 

Recording: (3745/ 9621) 
what i am saying when i talk to them or my mother very nice human being and a bunch of people i do not know 

Recording: (3746/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (3747/ 9621) 
exactly that is the that is the idea that people get they do not i do not think they realize that how much work it is 

Recording: (3748/ 9621) 
green bay packers 

Recording: (3749/ 9621) 
how am i going to tell her who is you know trying to butter me up by raising their hand in in asking questions um 

Recording: (3750/ 9621) 
perfect example you know or your computer can not tell you that you spelled o and e when you meant to spell w o n 

Recording: (3751/ 9621) 
right that is true 

Recording: (3752/ 9621) 
just like there is a lot of different uh like influences and everything and like there is just a lot of places you can go with it so it is real good 

Recording: (3753/ 9621) 
that and i heard i kind of like the change they are talking about they are talking about putting underground power lines and taking the pulls out 

Recording: (3754/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (3755/ 9621) 
yeah i so that is what i am going to do just yeah 

Recording: (3756/ 9621) 
yeah i mean maybe breakins are down we are holding up seven elevens they are down but then you hear these you know murders 

Recording: (3757/ 9621) 
oh oh  

Recording: (3758/ 9621) 
that would just be too scary for me 

Recording: (3759/ 9621) 
as back into in to high school 

Recording: (3760/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (3761/ 9621) 
yeah well uh west of them yeah so that is difficult for us to deal with 

Recording: (3762/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (3763/ 9621) 
that is where we are in our evolution  

Recording: (3764/ 9621) 
but definitely as it happened to me when i was in the third grade uh a friend of uh two of our friends were uh uh went home after school you were playing with again and everything and and uh one of them just ought to kill the time but you know it was not necessarily in the same place all the time either you know i mean so if you were not really look forward i mean you would have to happen stand just to stand onto it or something you know uh uh i believe nowadays you know that perhaps with the uh with the the guns and you know the bill the bill or the and more people having guns that do not know do not should not have them apparently uh you know they should be uh under lock and key uh you know as for the you know the parents somebody is responsible for it you know but see then you get into catch twenty two because of the legislation i mean you can not require i do not see how you you require a a a guy who buys a gun to buy a lock and then buy a safe for the for the gun and and do all that stuff because that in case if a bird or comes into your house which is why why you have a gun anyway you have some pure or something like that happening otherwise you should not have one unless you are a sportsman then uh then you know you are it is not going to be worth it to have the gun in the first place so 

Recording: (3765/ 9621) 
so it is not stressful at all right i it is really easy it is not challenging 

Recording: (3766/ 9621) 
yeah he is yeah he is twenty six 

Recording: (3767/ 9621) 
probably it is you are right i i asked him what language did he have to learn to cook 

Recording: (3768/ 9621) 
um i am a great employer and i i got hired in one of the oakland interview conversations with high end and in this particular month i am going to europe but i may when i come back he said sure let us keep talking he said okay and then we continue talking so um it is up in the air 

Recording: (3769/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3770/ 9621) 
he was always like really red face in the kids that say you know he went out at lunch and got drunk and came back and that was one of the better schools in columbus and you know i just saw a lot of that i just saw a lot of um uh principals driving big fabulous cars and 

Recording: (3771/ 9621) 
my dad act for time and being its not gonna be able to eat it of course i have beaten it you know 

Recording: (3772/ 9621) 
and it is really unfortunate for the good workers in there because and the people up near lake are so great 

Recording: (3773/ 9621) 
i teach a class on thursday nights uh how to play with computers i uh play games on tuesday nights 

Recording: (3774/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3775/ 9621) 
yeah there was a lot of them and they were not very good 

Recording: (3776/ 9621) 
oh yes i did but  

Recording: (3777/ 9621) 
and uh i do not know i think having just having the word honors gives it some kids enough prestige they do not totally freak about it i am not going i believe 

Recording: (3778/ 9621) 
boy i do not know i am thinking you know the the divorced people i know had children in involved and um boy it always seems to me by the time they get to that step it is already you know they have already been to counseling they have already tried a lot of other things and that they are uh i do not know whether some kind of court ordered thinking about it that have you thinking we would uh 

Recording: (3779/ 9621) 
and stuff but you know you are sitting there or you are like reading magazine did you know what this guy did you know look at him to see what this guy did 

Recording: (3780/ 9621) 
and it is really sort of interesting 

Recording: (3781/ 9621) 
yeah  and then but you you know i mean that that is that is  

Recording: (3782/ 9621) 
oh well 

Recording: (3783/ 9621) 
and uh eventually he he was all right with it he got used to it 

Recording: (3784/ 9621) 
a lot of them they do not want any but they will not want anything different that is all they want 

Recording: (3785/ 9621) 
but uh you know i knew that uh they had already made that from us and there is a lot of businesses that could move out of that area you know and half of those taxes come to columbus even if the businesses is in west everybody is half the tax the employees tax are going to um west everybody and half are coming to columbus 

Recording: (3786/ 9621) 
gun box or easy picking break in anything uh but when i was a kid too we used to go out to turkey shoots and i would go hunting all the time so i was pretty familiar with guns my kid uh he grew up he was familiar with guns but he all of a sudden you know they touch him 

Recording: (3787/ 9621) 
yeah they do not well we just sort of started making a big spread in australia in about the last three years so they may not they may have 

Recording: (3788/ 9621) 
i am trying to work on my license for skayaving though umhum 

Recording: (3789/ 9621) 
that you would need uh like in the old days you know to melt metal they used uh air dumping it through 

Recording: (3790/ 9621) 
not not yet not i mean he he will pull himself up on to have a different he will like turn around like hey 

Recording: (3791/ 9621) 
yeah i i hope to uh met forty nine you know i i have learned a heck of a lot uh lot of things i would not want to know you know but i think it  i think uh they have been for a good as long as they he turn them around them then they come upon to the state before you but that is why they are all right to have uh a a book store just like down around campus you know people can come in and go there and relax you know and um 

Recording: (3792/ 9621) 
well uh when i came uh back from oregon my father was very ill and so i did not want full time work and i started substituting out in uh looking county uh in which paid terribly low that there is all these little districts that have uh super and ten that well now they have two elementaries one middle school and one high school and a super and ten that which they do not need you know so they are hard straight out of college choice and there there is a law that uh you have to pay four year accumulated time so i could not get a job out there because i had about six years experience they had to pay me four so i came it back into columbus and it is a lot harder to work in columbus public but but uh i i know that territory i know where i am going  

Recording: (3793/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3794/ 9621) 
well basically it is the same thing here but some of your management is real good i have seen people that that you know are super but i have seen people that are bad the problem is you get a bad management and it can make your life hell i do not care who you are 

Recording: (3795/ 9621) 
um so he he is learning about the computer now and it is gonna be kind of a hobby so i have at least it is not a work thing but i know we can do a lot of things for a house 

Recording: (3796/ 9621) 
do you and i hate hearing myself on tape  

Recording: (3797/ 9621) 
i you know maybe i am oblivious to things but i mean i mean it seems like there is a lot of worst places 

Recording: (3798/ 9621) 
i do not know i do not know if i could trust them you know 

Recording: (3799/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3800/ 9621) 
uh oh okay well you know the shot is 

Recording: (3801/ 9621)

Recording: (3802/ 9621) 
see it they can they can be dupping them you know seventy seven years old they can not imagine being hurt by them you know 

Recording: (3803/ 9621) 
yeah you can not say and now it is always going to be orange and it is going to be slippery you know i mean language is so much more abstract than math and science so the abstract area is like history and english and reading and literature that is where these kids have their problems because their disability is usually rooted in somewhere in the languages they either can not write can not read can not spell can not do all three or are not very good at any of them once in a while you will see a good speller because he can remember the order in which letters come but he might be a horrible reader and a horrible writer even though he can spell yeah and his comprehension of the words of other kids is age would not be what it should be generally speaking my kids are two to four years behind 

Recording: (3804/ 9621) 
umhumhis culture it the other day the you know the weather i do not know the weather you know they are off of the black they and they well it is uh they are actually black umhumit is 

Recording: (3805/ 9621) 
no i did not really start out as a teacher i started out as a speechk they are in therapist but they kept giving me these kids that i could not keep them in the chair long enough to do the speech therapy with them so i got interested in the high for activity and so i started taking classes about any kids was eighty eight and stuff and little by little for c you know i had my masters in learning disabilities and it was mostly just so i could learn how to keep the kids in their seat long enough to do the speech therapy and then when i found out there was so many openings in special ed so and then i found out later that speech therapy is a very good background for ld because a lot of these ld kids have language deficit and language problems they they can not you know like express themselves on paper or they do not process things correctly auditorly so that is the perfect background to work with ld kids i did not know i was doing that at the time but 

Recording: (3806/ 9621) 
sure well that and they like tuesday when we were blessed with the turn of the sense of weather there she came in and i did i was reading a book and let her out and i let her back in the start reading again and i am looking around and here is mud so it is kind of good in a way because it kind of well you know uh you live here it is not that big of a deal you know because i know my sister would freak  i am 

Recording: (3807/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (3808/ 9621) 
well is it it it just communication was not there 

Recording: (3809/ 9621) 
well i think it is more capable of being violent because of the uh information available to people about bombs and stuff like that you know or before you know somebody gets mad somebody you know they might they might shoot them or something but not kill a hundred and a some people for no reason 

Recording: (3810/ 9621)

Recording: (3813/ 9621) 
which is not fun and number two you know the diseases and things like that i think that is a good idea to teach just that it is not all uh fine and peer pressure and stuff i know i kind of got off track there but 

Recording: (3814/ 9621) 
umhum  

Recording: (3815/ 9621) 
yeah uh i do not think he spends time with him like that you know he sees them at his mom is house and then you know will come by and see them at my house but i try to um put a i do not know because we seem to argue a lot you know and i do not like this for my kid to see that so i try i try to do the best thing for my son 

Recording: (3816/ 9621) 
yeah it is it is uh probably about four years left i am almost done with all my gcs and everything like that so that is about done  

Recording: (3817/ 9621)

uh you know just always just active and he is always been very active in sports but when i put him on the redland he was um laying on the couch you know just zombiey to 

Recording: (3829/ 9621) 
to make money on the side all through the government uh that is what i mean it is too easy to get away with stuff nowadays 

Recording: (3830/ 9621) 
i think they should too i do i really do i mean and and you are right that is not fair because then that is that is a waste 

Recording: (3831/ 9621) 
um i do not know do you know anything about you either 

Recording: (3832/ 9621) 
you could call the operations over there and say you know as i started point on the ground 

Recording: (3833/ 9621) 
and they set the ammunition on fire they just they have a gun position up pretty good and uh in that night finally they well i do not know exactly how we got a hold of back to our headwaters but anyway we did and so they sent uh prime movers which they the trucks which we moved to guns with out and uh we had said what was left remaining of the guns on them and went back and wondering now  they going to put us in indry or something we do not have any activity guns but uh i do not know it was not but a couple or three days they had more guns i mean more our tillerie pieces up there for us to use and then another time after italy or when we were in italy we they moved us into a position that we should have never been in we were you know they say we come a lot around the mountain like they are in the mountain here 

Recording: (3834/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (3835/ 9621)

Recording: (3839/ 9621) 
i am looking for parts of my job as to speak i have been like doing temporary on and off as the thing with that is you can work you know for four or five months and then nothing and then like that so right now i am looking for something permanent 

Recording: (3840/ 9621) 
so i think 

Recording: (3841/ 9621) 
her her little boyfriend who was the the captain kirk commander reagan like stud person uh i see in many ways uh i mean i agree in dsp and big dspisney is not a fan so i do not dislike voyager i just do not like it to the same degree um in dsp huh and i had major cure uh who was a soldier in the revolutionary and i i thought in many ways she like completely broke out of traditional it roles i also like deep space nine in that uh they address the issue of different people living at working to get different people at different i mean these were alien rather than different ethnic denominated of humus but it it approach that from a less um uh from a more realistic standpoint in instead of having you know like an old star trek you know everyone gets along then we come to people who do not get along and we look at the problem it was centered on that uh i am getting off topic and i wanted to go back to to voyager wayne you are saying that that the uh generals i i liked at first having uh captain jane way being a female in the leadership standpoint but i i still think that uh this the women on the show particularly seven of nine uh are are used in sex subjects uh for the for the viewers 

Recording: (3842/ 9621) 
oh where they they were already in the garage they now buy them themselves 

Recording: (3843/ 9621) 
it is just because it is in the name of government they are suspicious and uh 

Recording: (3844/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (3845/ 9621) 
uh they were helping up the the new guys

Recording: (3847/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (3848/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (3849/ 9621)

Recording: (3850/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (3851/ 9621)

well that you have uh you have an urban area with a lot of poor children uh a lot of single parent families and just the population is changing period from the the two parent family very the mother not working into one parent with the mother working that makes a big difference in how the child does at school 

Recording: (3926/ 9621)

Recording: (3932/ 9621) 
in the open shelter on over the year you have been around there but it is not a pretty site you know 

Recording: (3933/ 9621) 
that is all right 

Recording: (3934/ 9621) 
she does not know that i do not go to church 

Recording: (3935/ 9621) 
yeah i mean it is not i mean it was a really long time ago everything is fine but i guess for me i just it i do not know it is it is a little more it is a little more than i wanted to see but the classes i think were helpful but um would not you ask me 

Recording: (3936/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (3937/ 9621) 
oh yeah i have been doing i have been there twenty over twenty years so you know i am enjoying it it is always changing 

Recording: (3938/ 9621) 
yeah i live close to 

Recording: (3939/ 9621) 
oh i am i am sure the fact that my parents um my mother tries real tries really hard but my my father was an alcoholic he was a working alcoholic so that he insisted you know he he could drink on the weekends and never miss work et cetera yeah there was no problem and uh um but the biggest problem is the fact that you know i um i i i have always expected to have some sort of a respect from them and because they always wanted me to grow up and be independent and thing for myself and so i am exactly what they always said they wanted it is just that they can not handle that and so when i was in seventh grade and i got a lot in a lot of trouble about on the whole racial thing because uh i remember home of school where i was mostly white students were 

Recording: (3940/ 9621) 
but you can make them aware if somebody has an adult steps over that line or makes them uncomfortable you know there should be some kind of a uh system to where these girls a slightest bit you know it is a slousyous it is you know 

Recording: (3941/ 9621) 
yeah uh my brother did not know what the heck to do with a check book 

Recording: (3942/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (3943/ 9621) 
umhum uh we actually we are from columbus and we moved down to athons and uh they moved back up there when i was in sixty nine seventy two so uh and i was in two years reserved uh uh basically an electronic engineer not not an engineer but electronic assembly and stuff like that and this is just you know this is the phone that was called it was called but they could get these big names and things 

Recording: (3944/ 9621) 
to tell you the truth the school i went to was that it i mean 

Recording: (3945/ 9621) 
would be would be interested in i mean i mean not just for the kids sakes but would be interested on their own be half in in teaching the child what uh 

Recording: (3946/ 9621) 
he 

Recording: (3947/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (3948/ 9621) 
she was but i admire her more  because um uh until the moderates get control of the republican party again that is going to be the litistist test it was just like back in in the sixties and the seventies when the extreme left wing had control of democratic party they would nomination such people as um a govern who had not you know who i voted for but had no chance of winning over the years i have moderated my hard line left to center liberal stance for more of a moderate middle of the road because it is easier to get that sold to the american public um so the wild i think door was correct uh i think she uh she shot herself in the foot i do not she would have never gotten the nomination as long as the party remains the way that it is being controlled by the extreme right wing which is a problem for the republicans they moved they need to move towards the middle which i think georgia w is trying to do uh uh whenever anybody tells me that i go tell them i tell them yes and i am an in uh an indifferent liberal 

Recording: (3949/ 9621) 
and they have met the couple that is going to adopt the baby which seems kind of odd to me but 

Recording: (3950/ 9621) 
has him for about four years he refusedes to he refusedes to live with us because we have rules 

Recording: (3951/ 9621) 
i keep thinking about that all the time but i am like i want something where i can be off during the summer so i can take my kids and we can go out west or you know have because my wife is in the same boat she will retire two years after i do and our kids you know will be young i have five year old and i only have six years to go so we are talking eleven years old 

Recording: (3952/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (3953/ 9621) 
b big ever 

Recording: (3954/ 9621) 
i have heard it and it has not been as i have heard it from less reputable sources 

Recording: (3955/ 9621) 
okay i think if you are able to cook two back pick up pretty cool you know 

Recording: (3956/ 9621) 
i do not think forcinging fair on somebody if they do not believe in it i do not think that is the right thing to do but 

Recording: (3957/ 9621) 
no because they are going to learn that on their own um i i personally think it is a choice i do not think you are born that way because i i have friends that are homosexual and um you know i do not believe in what they are doing but i do not do everything right every day so i still love them and they are my friends and all the block because but i have also known people that were that way and now are homosexual and are much happier and they realized that it was just the choice they made and things like that um so it is in today is day and age they are going to learn about it quickly 

Recording: (3958/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (3959/ 9621) 
umhum but oh that is a bunch of  that is just one of those myths  i think that is to make people so guilty or something 

Recording: (3960/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3961/ 9621) 
yeah well i think it would be good if it expanded out a little bit more i mean it is smaller compared to most downtown i mean you you know it seems like you just drive through and two minutes and you are out so i do not think that would hurt anything and then to live there if they made it more affordable that would be nice so 

Recording: (3962/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3963/ 9621) 
biology experience 

Recording: (3964/ 9621) 
yeah yeah then there there would be no desire yeah 

Recording: (3965/ 9621) 
i was in climates for the first like six years i taught 

Recording: (3966/ 9621) 
oh oh wow oh see and she is probably really good 

Recording: (3967/ 9621) 
sunday 

Recording: (3968/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (3969/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (3970/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (3971/ 9621) 
now we used to do uh fifty cents you know a game you know just uh wind back the quarters and plop them in you know not too much gambling on that part yeah 

Recording: (3972/ 9621) 
it is it was very much high school 

Recording: (3973/ 9621) 
but right now with his attitude the way it is i would say that me and my family are better off not having him steering up a bunch of conflict or whatever 

Recording: (3974/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (3975/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (3976/ 9621) 
like going 

Recording: (3977/ 9621) 
uh so there is always something going wrong with the wiring or the plumbing or the something and uh it seemed like a good idea about twenty five years ago to get a house that older house but no no anymore  

Recording: (3978/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3979/ 9621) 
they never saw it they never said anything about it 

Recording: (3980/ 9621) 
i do not know it just sounds like it would be something that i would have to have it is just necessary  

Recording: (3981/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (3982/ 9621) 
it is supposed to be a uh let me see school for art 

Recording: (3983/ 9621) 
i want you to be a man you know play basketball 

Recording: (3984/ 9621) 
oh i wish yeah i do it during summer too i usually work down here 

Recording: (3985/ 9621) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (3986/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (3987/ 9621) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (3988/ 9621) 
because i guess it all came together because i do not understand how people can let their kids be heard but 

Recording: (3989/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3990/ 9621) 
but they should do is just tell people if their kids do not get to go to school i bet the attitude changes pretty fast  

Recording: (3991/ 9621) 
i do not know if there is any particular i think if someone knows if anyone knew of something like that going on they would 

Recording: (3992/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3993/ 9621) 
and i think i think if we could you know if if we could just keep that going into into middle school 

Recording: (3994/ 9621) 
yeah i could get to any program i wanted to you know just chill up at the parties basically 

Recording: (3995/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3996/ 9621) 
she wears high heels why would she wear high heels  

Recording: (3997/ 9621) 
uh mom and sister who move out to california 

Recording: (3998/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (3999/ 9621) 
the milk okay so it 

Recording: (4000/ 9621) 
could not know 

Recording: (4001/ 9621) 
come on you know people i do not know i would hate to be in the predicament of having to change anything because it would be hard to change from one group and on another 

Recording: (4002/ 9621) 
as opposed to what the catholic church actually thinks is correct and 

Recording: (4003/ 9621) 
yeah it can be a problem i mean if you get head 

Recording: (4004/ 9621) 
oh i think i think the society in a general is decline in a lot of ways our morals are big climbing in our uh intelligence level maybe not level i mean i accuse are still high but people are selling for less i have a big sign in my room that says never settle for less than you are very best because i really think people are getting lazy even adults we you know we do not even wanna wait twenty five seconds for microwave popcorn we do not you know we are gonna be in patient 

Recording: (4005/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (4006/ 9621) 
oh is that right 

Recording: (4007/ 9621) 
probably um northwest area 

Recording: (4008/ 9621) 
oh really uh it is like oh milk and swisslers 

Recording: (4009/ 9621) 
and some of them did and some of them were just complete idiots but you find out anywhere 

Recording: (4010/ 9621) 
but yeah okay 

Recording: (4011/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4012/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (4013/ 9621) 
uh the the accent sometimes it is like um i sort of a running joke i do not know if i should say this but it is like if i can talk like this and uh talk all the time like this why is it that they can talk like we do you know it is like you know if i can if i could talk that way because we had do have pilots that do talk like 

Recording: (4014/ 9621) 
like let us go come on  my doctor said hey it is time we can do this so i got it lucky even though i kind of wanted it to have it you know normal 

Recording: (4015/ 9621) 
all right 

Recording: (4016/ 9621) 
oh okay 

Recording: (4017/ 9621) 
issues so um you know that is one thing that i hope that they they work on 

Recording: (4018/ 9621) 
well it would have been something that they would have supported and something that i would have probably been pretty good at 

Recording: (4019/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4020/ 9621) 
what is bad about where i work at it is it is not so much race as a matter of fact if you are my supervisor i am just using the apple and i do something wrong 

Recording: (4021/ 9621) 
she read my notes and all that 

Recording: (4022/ 9621) 
so i made a lot of stupid you know you look back and you see things you can like this is real obvious but at the time i think used i was like um hey i can either change them or if they love me we can communicate and change things and you know that type of thing 

Recording: (4023/ 9621) 
and then you come here you know and i mean you see people stand out on the street corners with signs work for food 

Recording: (4024/ 9621) 
oh yeah i think it is possible it would have to take the right combination of uh someone who can appeal to the party people and get the nomination and appeal to the people i think dole would have been a good candidate i would have been hard pressed i mean that is some of her issues i do not like but when she came out uh and said her her her famous thing on the abortion issue when she came out against guns uh she went up with a couple of notches in in in my estimation because i was not sure where she would be i thought she would have to sell herself is hard lying with a hard line republican and then i would not have been able to vote for her 

Recording: (4025/ 9621) 
and and she is very determined uh she has said that having this being pregnant and having this baby is made her focus something is a lot differently she uh she does not want to go back to being the way she was before she does not want to go back to the the drugs and the smoking and the drinking 

Recording: (4026/ 9621) 
great guy but he sort of liked good drunk you know and they problem with him he was turning it such a jerk 

Recording: (4027/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4028/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4029/ 9621) 
umhum right right yeah 

Recording: (4030/ 9621) 
yeah being a nurse the wife that helps a lot because that is what that thing was really function around was nurses getting them from good day care because they work all these wild shifts and stuff so that is how it first started before it was not even on campus it was over on like fourth or something in it church when it first started but and uh it is just not you know people were always saying i can not believe how much you pay for day care and i am like but look what we are getting you know people take their kids to somebody is neighbor is house and the lady can be sitting them in front of the tv 

Recording: (4031/ 9621) 
then then they were raised than they are but i told her i you know there is i will never be married if my man is going to be jeating on me i will not marry him 

Recording: (4032/ 9621) 
and he is just pretty much cut ties with all of his old friends and we still see them all the way out and we were close with their parents and 

Recording: (4033/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4034/ 9621) 
oh i see well that would be a good way i would think 

Recording: (4035/ 9621) 
 whole lot more places to live it seems like everywhere i turn there is construction and and you know you go down one one road and then you wait a couple of years if you do not go in that area and it is all changed it looks all different so and that is mainly like looking up that is all and three fifteen door things like that 

Recording: (4036/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4037/ 9621) 
get it from us so 

Recording: (4038/ 9621) 
i defend my stepfather against the rest of my family immediately falling my father is death because there was uh some bitterness between the rest of my family and my stepfather so my sister and i defend my stepfather against the rest of my family stepmother eventually shifted us and so stepmother is evil 

Recording: (4039/ 9621) 
right and then they wonder why uh you know i do not know what is happening it is the other person who is changed you know and if you if you start changing your behavior you can usually get the kinds of changes i always figure if you treat people the way they will go the wrong thing if you if you give out what you want back you get it 

Recording: (4040/ 9621) 
play a lot of rain for a while if i have a couple of bucks on me and uh well football games we will not even start with that  

Recording: (4041/ 9621)

Recording: (4045/ 9621) 
really yeah i do not feel own at all i mean i you know a lot of people think wow you should know what you want to do or you know and and i guess there is different phase like uh rambas highericky what is that the uh the higherucky of needs manly uh massahow anyway

Recording: (4078/ 9621) 
that is what they go back to the fire is by i guess you you survive okay is because you are here  you still teaching  

Recording: (4079/ 9621) 
most of them at our site now we have more of a distributed system where we can actually go out and connect others people connect us and then go out and it is a gate way to other places you know we are getting more into that now but that was not easy so easy before either the you know the way it began 

Recording: (4080/ 9621) 
huh 

Recording: (4081/ 9621) 
the parents have so much responsibility but the kid has so much responsibility and then society has so much responsibility so you know what i mean basically all all i have ever seen is well i these kids are getting the house they go to the house they find a gun and they want to hold the parents responsible yes and no on that if the parents had a gun in the house they had to uh ammunition locked up say in the trunk of the car one of the kid bought the ammunition from somewhere else and picked the gunlock off the gun 

Recording: (4082/ 9621) 
or i got a drive you know further north so i think they need to come in you know you know get the downtown going when i was a kid i would love to go to downtown 

Recording: (4083/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4084/ 9621) 
 paying you know uhhuh 

Recording: (4085/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4086/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4087/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4088/ 9621) 
like a little fapoo is 

Recording: (4089/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (4090/ 9621) 
they were all around the same age you know and going to collegemy daughter julie does uh is very active though in uh not necessarily that she has adopted her two children so she is become very active in the adoption procedure in tulsa and uh 

Recording: (4091/ 9621) 
but our belief is that it did not it it needed to be restored and we believe i do not know if you have heard about just this mess or 

Recording: (4092/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4093/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4094/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4095/ 9621) 
that would be fine but again i do not it is just another person with a different life style it is like they are they are they are the same as me it is just 

Recording: (4096/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4097/ 9621) 
no i just uh basically got out of a a a relationship it was like a rebound type thing um i was in a relationship for like three years and um he was shooting on me and so i felt really bad and wentand then i met this guy who seemed wonderful and then turned out to be not so wonderful 

Recording: (4098/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4099/ 9621) 
uh and work the fourth 

Recording: (4100/ 9621) 
they should have on the news most people keep the house five to seven years before they still wanna move on 

Recording: (4101/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4102/ 9621) 
uh i would either go back in uh languages or actually i am a psychology undergraduate so  yeah 

Recording: (4103/ 9621) 
because like i think it is archy griffin that went to a really crummy school in in in columbus and to me no matter how bad of an area you live in and about as bad as school you think you are going to if you want to do it you can because it and really in public schools if you have a learning disability or you know that if you have problems reading or you have problems at home there is a psychologist or a tutor or something to help you and and in uh like worthinton in west ofville dublin you know they do not have the money to throw away in like ethnic schools they do not have the money to put on those programs so some of those people kind of get pushed aside and so you know as you can see i am staying by soapbox i do like coming to these schools but you know i i i hate when people say you know look at these test scores because it really does not reflect what is there because it is like saying all kids carry guns to school they do not you know the media says well what has there been like maybe five or six people who have taken onto school and killed people what about the uh millions and millions of kids that go to school every day do their homework and you know do community service and stuff well oh it is just too boring they do not want to hear that stuff you know like that that irritates me 

Recording: (4104/ 9621) 
yeah we have done a lot of searching when we bought our house and it is hard to find what you want in the house and get the school system too you get into arlington you get into grand view places like this or back story and the price range we were in you were going to have to dump fifty thousand into the house just to get them up you know we had a list of what we wanted in a house and our house was only seventeen years old when we bought it but it had had everything we wanted fire place full drive basically you know two and a half car drive around you know all the stuff that we wanted when a lot of the older houses wet basements garage bird down or you know the lots were packed so we live on a golf course and have a creek in the backyard and so it is really yeah they do not yeah they play in the creek i do not play golf yet but 

Recording: (4105/ 9621) 
i do not know you know climates and foots and up courts and my parents all through growing up they play golf and i really was interested in it um i just think enough is not up though i yeah um there is so many but 

Recording: (4106/ 9621) 
i mean you could cut paper with this kind of rain  it is just coming down all over the place hale and lightning 

Recording: (4107/ 9621) 
yeah i take organic i have to take um biology chemistry physics and then um i have to complete eight years if it is biology i am going to break i do not know i am going to take twenty nine hours of it 

Recording: (4108/ 9621) 
yeah yeah she is been known to do that too yeah  

Recording: (4109/ 9621) 
she has now she has it right since my sister reagan was born in a megan in twenty so she but the thing is i have got another i have got a a sister in my sister magazine um joe is my brother he is fifteen and a half and then i have a sister van person who is twelve 

Recording: (4110/ 9621) 
a cleanest position on it well he started back down from what it was gonna be and then just hope that it would drop i mean it went which you are hearing me lately as it definitely has not changed much uh in that but again that is i think part of that too is society is not ready at some level to accept that insoinates in the military is one thing but then people are talking about getting rid of each person 

Recording: (4111/ 9621) 
three 

Recording: (4112/ 9621) 
as of the mass people you got to find out and figure out what needs they are going to roll into like when they get older you know you get into the wheel chair companies or something you know somewhere it is just going to be massive 

Recording: (4113/ 9621) 
probably a little bit 

Recording: (4114/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4115/ 9621) 
and and what they say that we have done to the language and everything else and and you are not a typical american but you know and then the next hour and a half they just say how bad americans are and you can kind of think like well thanks for the execution but you still have been insulted me for an hour now 

Recording: (4116/ 9621) 
yeah well it is gotten a lot worse uh when i say a lot worse because if you know you say you do not have kids i have got a kid twenty three years old and it was in the place for him to play 

Recording: (4117/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (4118/ 9621) 
well and it is not just in the schools it is in society uh the environment seems to be an answer to a lot of things and uh it is it is hard to imagine that there is an easy fix or there is a fix i do not know it is kind of frustrating because you can not point to one thing and say this is what needs to be fixed again this pervasive uh it is like the i do not know if you heard about this in the news a woman too even ramming an argument one one of them said far to the other one 

Recording: (4119/ 9621) 
did he really 

Recording: (4120/ 9621) 
oh okay i thought well my you mean because like some 

Recording: (4121/ 9621) 
he uh told he never said much about it except he told about one time one of his in uh hospital up in japan after he was burned he said that he is uh award with a bunch of other burden patients and and he said uh some of them been human coulded were able to get up and walk around so uh and i can see the philosophy the meddics had the guys that could walk help wait on the guys that were a mid ground and uh he was had been helping one guy that was pretty bad off just got past way did not make it and so they started to put on and get on to do something they do not want to put something in the other guys i am sure of i am not working any more with them he told him and he told him yes you are what are you going to do send me back over to vietnam  but they sent him home but he was he was uh not a very enthusiastic exposure i do not think at any time and especially after he came home 

Recording: (4122/ 9621) 
and that was very stressful 

Recording: (4123/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4124/ 9621) 
and so but certainly after he was held enough to go back to work they were married 

Recording: (4125/ 9621) 
um yeah 

Recording: (4126/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4127/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (4128/ 9621) 
and then you do your residency you do not have to do residency but if you ever want to go classical you have to do it

Recording: (4130/ 9621)

Recording: (4132/ 9621)

um i am a pr major right now hoping to get into computer animation 

Recording: (4141/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4142/ 9621)

Recording: (4143/ 9621) 
um i first of all could not be a friend 

Recording: (4144/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4145/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4146/ 9621)

Recording: (4151/ 9621) 
yeah yeah  equal distance 

Recording: (4152/ 9621) 
probably but they do not they will not you know part of it is they feel flabberg part of it is like wow they you know this guy thinks i am nice looking or whatever 

Recording: (4153/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4154/ 9621) 
okay fine and the family probably said okay well we want you get advancement we want your good will the problem is you ran out of culture differences culture differences over here and so forth and then and then we became a little more uh promiscuous and so gee now mom dad and so forth elm was going out here and the west coast with us you know so forth and they think everything is going okay because we did not have communications as frequent and all of a sudden you find out and usually mom finds out she is some of them does not sound right to the airwaves or to the riding some of the mysteries going on here and you found they are they are having difficulties well the voice became acceptable before i was a no no and now it not acceptable and then you had uh the celebrities becoming more is another oh hey we do not we do not we do not get married anymore not okay then we have the idea of doing away with cash gold let us have the metal back yard i think it was kennedy was the one that did that and said we will just uh print parochial notes and so now we keep credit we we buy ourselves i will ever get a limit in the world and saying well hey we will just pay them more we pay them more country then fine but every kind they print more it makes the money in your investment less but hey who cares i do not know that is what they 

Recording: (4155/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4156/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4157/ 9621) 
nope 

Recording: (4158/ 9621)

Recording: (4159/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (4160/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (4161/ 9621) 
excuse me 

Recording: (4162/ 9621) 
uh i kind of uh i i was like a trouble you know i did not really uh and it was not really my cup of tea actually i had a pretty decent job i worked four and a half days a week uh basically in the uh the electrical mechanical type of things you know remove over your place what they do a lot now with cars you know they put a thing on the machine and it says take that out you know try it you know and put that in it you know so it is it is it you know try it you know you put that in so it was it it in hind sight you know it was it was cool but but i had i liked it longer it was back in the sixties so you know 

Recording: (4163/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4164/ 9621) 
which i mean is not necessarily a bad thing but i mean it is something that is definitely noticeable in there 

Recording: (4165/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4166/ 9621) 
i do not think that i would have them go to any i learned things like how to speak french how to set a dinner table how to throw a hot tub party and that kind of step was a lot more focused than i mean i did not even i do not think anybody even taught me on a riding course other than my parents so i mean it was it was interesting i mean it was a lot more cultural kind of kinds of things to do a lot of things with nature and then they are kind of oh was the seventies too so i mean your husband has a lick of the time what we are talking about but i have i feel like i do not see why i would not send them to public school 

Recording: (4167/ 9621) 
do you 

Recording: (4168/ 9621) 
um uh the the the public transit system i mean i know they are doing the best they can but i do not see how we are ever going to get out of this without light rail and i have really bummed 

Recording: (4169/ 9621) 
yeah avoiding the the steaks is pretty much what they need to do better decisions that help

Recording: (4174/ 9621) 
from high school and that one in that original group of kids that i had never did pass them all but i got he is not worried because he is going to work with his dad in his dad is business so he is going to be okay but he never did pass the reading and the writing he passed everything out but and the questions are not the same they i mean there are several different forms every time they send out the test that is filled in a box and nobody is allowed to open up but the principal and then he has to be distributed it to the teachers and so the questions could change 

Recording: (4175/ 9621) 
do my um building and stuff like yourself money  

Recording: (4176/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4177/ 9621) 
well i think he parted with a dog and a girl into the mall you know and partyed a little bit with the donald is and the that is one thing that she about getting it to one nowadays a lot too is uh socializing like it shopping mall and things of that nature umhum 

Recording: (4178/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4179/ 9621) 
yeah hoosiers  they do not they do not actually sit down with you they automatically assume that once you get to this level you are ready for this level and you go on 

Recording: (4180/ 9621) 
yeah i had a cousin that went on she she was in school for that and um as you could tell i like to do office work i 

Recording: (4181/ 9621) 
that is what i was actually thinking of um where he takes the pictures on the corner 

Recording: (4182/ 9621) 
now and it was just taking her out of her you know where she you know you grow up hearing those lies and 

Recording: (4183/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (4184/ 9621) 
oh apollo oh yeah yeah my my my mom my mom especially is just like when are you going to stop doing that yeah because he is sixteen months now and i think he is tapering off quite a bit so i think that he will be done soon but i am not pushing him so 

Recording: (4185/ 9621) 
you should you should be organized i am not i have this stack of like groceries maybe right off the foot high sitting next to my bed just went out and bought groceries and then the carman is open again 

Recording: (4186/ 9621) 
i mean you just never know how freaky 

Recording: (4187/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4188/ 9621) 
i am sure yeah i mean uh she he does not throw them in there in face no women call the house or anything uh you never know what she does not you know question him about where he is been or anything like that and i just she just i just can not believe that i just think that is terrible 

Recording: (4189/ 9621) 
oh that is it 

Recording: (4190/ 9621) 
it is it is uh it is kind of oahuous in the middle of the city 

Recording: (4191/ 9621) 
yeah not much expensive  

Recording: (4192/ 9621) 
it is more feasible than a six year old 

Recording: (4193/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4194/ 9621) 
yeah  exactly so you know once you once you get to a certain degree of uh frustration you need to relieve that somehow so that is pretty much why we moved 

Recording: (4195/ 9621) 
i have always thought that it it ends up being a personal decision 

Recording: (4196/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4197/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4198/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4199/ 9621) 
and they see the same thing it is made back to them because we are making price images and we can not say no to him that is what heaven is like that is what we should go to the bed night thinking what did we do positive today and build on the positive it may have been a small less part of that sheet of paper 

Recording: (4200/ 9621) 
but she was never interested in in never really interested in boys or in sports in high school or make up clothes and things like that and then you know you are setting yourself up for ridiculous high school for that and then so then she would come home and tear us because kids made fun of her and stuff and finally she just stopped going and within a couple months she she got her ged 

Recording: (4201/ 9621) 
putt on the putt on the mall around putt on the malluh i was going through divorced parents both parents passed away uh my ex moved to uh state louis and did not tell me anything about her four clothes and on the house and that is how i found out this she moved just uh bunch of shit and i guess started uh screwing up so they wanted to put me on probation in my uh probation attitude or whatever so i quit 

Recording: (4202/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4203/ 9621) 
yeah they they are really good about that 

Recording: (4204/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (4205/ 9621) 
those are the good days the outside though that is the one you used to own them too you can trade them that that is gonna be lost our rights there is some things that are traditional they are capitalized low t low case t and you are talking about low case t i am talking about capital capital t 

Recording: (4206/ 9621) 
bye 

Recording: (4207/ 9621) 
i was going to be able to relate to a comment that she made about i believe in the electric chair i believe in uh capital punishment uh but that was one comment she was talking about but then on the very very opposite extreme uh extreme opposite we talk about the love of the child from the day of this child in your arms and and then over here you are saying you believe in capital punishment and electrocution 

Recording: (4208/ 9621) 
i think example is probably the best uh they see that you care and they learn to care i think my son john he is the youngest i think he is a very compassionateatable uh very spiritual young man uh more so than his brother is and then i always had to tap away that you know they say that sometimes you give because it makes you you feel better to give and i sometime try to weigh that if that is part of why i i can not believe it is an attention getter because there is nothing to begin bygetting attention for the work you do but uh but maybe just within maybe one feels uh and i think i think it it is a matter of being conscientious to you know conscientious that there are 

Recording: (4209/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (4210/ 9621) 
uh it is quite possible but we picked the day care that i thought was close to well the one that was open that had the close together ways that we had um uh personally was like a church base program but there are not any well there were not any open one when we were looking for one um we did have the option of going here to always used their day care and it has a wonderful reputation and everybody that i have talked to that has had children there is very pleased with the program but what i did not like was so that they were not um important values on the children they do not separate any holidays at all so they just kind of ignore everything where he is now i still like getting my mother is day card and i mean they are doing trick or treat thing on thursday they are going to the door to door they get address up or he would not have gotten any of that that always you and they are pros and cons to to both of those but 

Recording: (4211/ 9621) 
well i ambeating a second job 

Recording: (4212/ 9621) 
like it is okay i mean it is like a country school which was always over ut i was always like you mean like my friends were always like the way because they used to have real long hair and so that was like oh he is to be like a big hippie or whatever and like um um that was i guess we heard kind of like being odd people in in a small in small and midwestern far i mean the school is it is kind of odd i guess um um 

Recording: (4213/ 9621) 
hum 

Recording: (4214/ 9621) 
yeah i i i loved one sixty one and i loved it around there i loved all those core restaurants and everything 

Recording: (4215/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (4216/ 9621) 
and getting back to the for fanity and stuff that was another one that was in the paper some of the parents are not leading the children right and it was about this mother and father was doing something all once their little kid maybe six or seven rate walked in there and said what the h to the four letter word is this four and the father is standing looks at the front end after the kid is wad after says i do not know where and the h to that child learned to talk like that they think he came of the way are not that they think age today yall learn to talk like that these are not getting so way right away so you think it is the ones it is the ones that are teaching the kids and it it is all those things that i have mentioned before but i think that really it goes back to that and what can we do to change it i think as i said it basically everybody has to learn to think of the other person and what is good for everybody not just me me me 

Recording: (4217/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (4218/ 9621) 
you know they can do it over they want 

Recording: (4219/ 9621) 
the efficiency see tests that they are now requiring you can not graduate from an ohio high school with a with a diploma unless you pass all the prof test and that means you have to take one in citizenship which is like government and history one in math one in science one in writing and one in reading and you have you can try to pass the first time in the eighth the end of the eighth grade then you get two tries in the ninth grade two tries in the tenth doing the eleventh and doing the twelfth you can take them as many times as you need to take them but if you do not pass them all by the time you graduate you get this nifty little thing called an attendant certificate it is not a real diploma it is like okay i attended i did not learn anything but i was there

well this is about given opinions in my opinion about the columbus public school system really is not good 

Recording: (4303/ 9621) 
that is what everybody when i tell people i play that is what everybody says but it seems to me that any instrument  can be hard  depending i mean i can not see how anybody can play a clarinet for example  but are some things that are hard about playing the french horn one is that you can play many different notes with a single finger 

Recording: (4304/ 9621)

Recording: (4307/ 9621) 
well i think it starts with the family but the problem is the last three years we have ever sized uh i should not say thirty years push war two push war two is where we broke the family up and let me tell you i i own theized during world war two we took the little lady out of the house and said hey we need you on the production lines making more machinery is 

Recording: (4308/ 9621) 
and it is just like been so for him too this has been you know a a a real amazing road because by the time he was twenty eighty i had four kids and you know and and yet you know we managed to to work through all that together and be with these kids and have this this kind of time we have now he is looking forward to he is thrilled about the the baby that my daughter is going to have but um i would have had a whole lot more kids you know i would have just kept having them and he said oh four is plenty you know he needed a break 

Recording: (4309/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (4310/ 9621) 
i know it 

Recording: (4311/ 9621) 
really see we almost think that that would be better but when you put it like that it certainly 

Recording: (4312/ 9621) 
like 

Recording: (4313/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (4314/ 9621) 
i think this year it is gonna be even worse stocking up water  

Recording: (4315/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (4316/ 9621) 
just ridiculous the barberism to me they uh 

Recording: (4317/ 9621) 
but now he is with that girl he was eating on with he is with her now they live together so he is like going to a pound too and i he is a they are like the real nice people it is just they just i you know feel like they do not and i try to tell them you know do not mess up again i just like grow up grow up 

Recording: (4318/ 9621) 
right yeah the middle of the month when they usually start most of this stuff uhhuh 

Recording: (4319/ 9621) 
i have become visual decentized to like the violence that i see in movies and on tv but i still see a distinct difference between that and real violence um i mean in studying history i am exposed to a number of like rather worse events in history that still are very i still find disturbing uh and also hang out in little life bars and every once in a while there will be a fight and it it is still i i mean it it still is disturbing to me i i i have a distinct difference in my head between reality and fiction and maybe kids like are not making that at that distinctions but uh i i do not think so and i think if if someone is not making that distant it is i do not know that that they are not uh i i do not know i do not have any evidence to uh to support it i just know that i have it i feel that i have it very clear distinction between what is uh back in what is fiction what is true and what is a imagination and uh so for me i do not think that television has affected me in that way um i mean one way that like television has affected me is i am full of media references when i speak you know when i am hanging out with friends so and mentioned is a a subject and i am like hey simpsons made fun of that you know at some point uh that is the effective season i mean i do not think that is too big in effect people are always used to you know like quote shakes you or something i guess that is ten times more elevator so to like oh but uh references the shakesesbyor line or something but i mean it it it is a part of our culture and i am a part of it and 

Recording: (4320/ 9621) 
but we are working on it we have got a couple of hospitals in right now and see how things go 

Recording: (4321/ 9621) 
yeah and i i just i guess i just felt like i do not know it is it is kind of i knew it i i i think because it is kind of neat and if you are looking at traffic and and i could see if i was going downtown and coming back being amount of money that you paid a park downtown is outrageous um even just having to taste i did not want it when it was snowing because i worked on i worked on front street and where i have come from so i live on down to snow road which is i take bath old or three fifteen down through downtown and it would take you know forty five minutes in the snow to get down there and if i could if i could jump on this rail system and it would take me fifteen minutes and i would not have to pay fifty dollars a month for parking why why not do that and now there is also the whole pollution thing and and those types of things and i thought that was 

Recording: (4322/ 9621) 
because of your internal clock 

Recording: (4323/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (4324/ 9621) 
and uh my oldest son uh uh uh completed uh completed what they call the garden country award in the church which is a a requiresers above as much work as uh eagle award in the scouts it is uh the scout sponsored but church centered uh award and then my second son because he is eagle award in scouts they am kind of proud they have because itah and that is not something that a lot of kids do you know 

Recording: (4325/ 9621) 
right uhhuh 

Recording: (4326/ 9621) 
i did not like it but i liked elements of it and it is unlike the the first star wars movie this one really is meant to be part of a trilogy the first star wars movie when it came out i mean it was in many ways an experiment it was part of the of the larger story 

Recording: (4327/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4328/ 9621) 
my mom 

Recording: (4329/ 9621)

Recording: (4330/ 9621) 
oh really 

Recording: (4331/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4332/ 9621) 
but she always she always put me first and i think that that made it a lot more positive for me 

Recording: (4333/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4334/ 9621) 
when northland moves and all that that the existing building she thinks they should turn into a discount store 

Recording: (4335/ 9621)

downtown abandoned and warehousing that get rented out for a night

Recording: (4341/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (4342/ 9621) 
umhum yeah 

Recording: (4343/ 9621)

Recording: (4344/ 9621) 
you have heard that  

Recording: (4345/ 9621) 
they get so they are just so poor and they and and i we felt sometimes like we could help them but they did not want any help and it was kind of hard to just say okay well i did what i could and 

Recording: (4346/ 9621) 
that is about right that is about right  i think it is individual individual federal federal that is all right 

Recording: (4347/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4348/ 9621) 
i can not see a lot of substance uh he seems to say what needs to be said at the time and then is on the back his is not a back track it is just like it is not anything really firm i mean with mckin and bradley they were saying they wanted to do this and this was what the points they wanted to make and that i do not hear that coming from bush 

Recording: (4349/ 9621) 
yeah she did that yesterday 

Recording: (4350/ 9621) 
so am i  um my master question before 

Recording: (4351/ 9621) 
they had to walk and i knew where they went and uh that was it um but they did not have the tv programs they have now they had more programs they were actually like uh i can not think of the some of the names of them anymore 

Recording: (4352/ 9621) 
we 

Recording: (4353/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4354/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4355/ 9621) 
i i say you should look in what we did was look in the newspaper and we found the top ten boys and the top ten girls names that have been the most popular for the last fifty years 

Recording: (4356/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4357/ 9621) 
i came and played there one time that was a team club 

Recording: (4358/ 9621) 
 and then yeah i got the opportunity um a a company that my sister had worked for one of her to come back 

Recording: (4359/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4360/ 9621) 
now not like they used to 

Recording: (4361/ 9621) 
you know it is it is just sad in our society that that is what it is turning to 

Recording: (4362/ 9621) 
and 

Recording: (4363/ 9621) 
yeah it is usually like about a third or something um think maybe two thirds of them live on campus it should be basically getting out of the house 

Recording: (4364/ 9621) 
yeah  

Recording: (4365/ 9621) 
the personal thing is you need to have ethics 

Recording: (4366/ 9621) 
it took my key in 

Recording: (4367/ 9621) 
right uh 

Recording: (4368/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4369/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (4370/ 9621) 
that is right thats right it is a parakeet 

Recording: (4371/ 9621) 
and i think probably eighty four 

Recording: (4372/ 9621) 
i uh group into is this is this registering it slipped since i 

Recording: (4373/ 9621) 
at the way of the year you know it would be great if somebody you know they would want to pump all this money into it but unfortunately whenever the government comes money into an area you know that it seems to be like a uh foreign country it gets it you know 

Recording: (4374/ 9621) 
yeah i figure right now i might as well take advantage of it 

Recording: (4375/ 9621) 
um i would say it does not really matter either way honestly i mean in fact the matters they are so deal with it i mean get over it i mean 

Recording: (4376/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4377/ 9621) 
yeah teach one person one thing and not teach the other person that kind of let me see here give you an example there is a the school that they should on twenty twenty somewhere out west i believe it is nevada or somewhere and they said that these uh teachers have the highest rating among many other teachers in the nation because of their actual sitting down the hands on were speaking these children like uh ex girlfriend of mine she was pretty much i would not put her border line in a literate but she did not know how to read or write 

Recording: (4378/ 9621) 
a could i could it might take me a uh a year or two 

Recording: (4379/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4380/ 9621) 
they are all boys there so when i pick him up from there he is out of hand a little bit and i have got to get him back you know you are with mommy now you have got to behave level down 

Recording: (4381/ 9621) 
but it is fun 

Recording: (4382/ 9621) 
adios on on everything it is just like 

Recording: (4383/ 9621) 
caring could seal up in their little slot you know in the arm 

Recording: (4384/ 9621) 
and to reach that the founder also realizes that if you can break that cycle through the children so these focusing emphasis was really on the children 

Recording: (4385/ 9621) 
something to think about 

Recording: (4386/ 9621) 
yeah it just but i can not understand is some people live in up for arlington and some of them get to private school 

Recording: (4387/ 9621) 
not for long 

Recording: (4388/ 9621) 
and that is what we did and so he is just like my own too now i go to volunteer and he is in kindergarten and i go to volunteer in his classroom too so it is kind of like i hope i get to do this forever 

Recording: (4389/ 9621) 
ap in 

Recording: (4390/ 9621) 
exactly 

Recording: (4391/ 9621) 
course they do not leave in the unions now like they used to 

Recording: (4392/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (4393/ 9621) 
oh you yeah i know 

Recording: (4394/ 9621) 
or i would say ninety nine ninety eight percent  

Recording: (4395/ 9621) 
pretty much uh looked at them all my all life uh i was born in some barney braze and kina i was in the service uh for four years uh so i actually came back here in nineteen seventy two and i have been here since then i was born in nineteen fifty uh august twenty fifth uh divorced and i have a daughter that would be nineteen this year and then they live in saint louis 

Recording: (4396/ 9621) 
popular bands 

Recording: (4397/ 9621) 
and 

Recording: (4398/ 9621) 
and our practitioner has more authority i guess to diagnose and see patients um the state of ohioas i think the only state that has a has to come in confirm our findings and then he actually writes the prescriptions 

Recording: (4399/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (4400/ 9621) 
so that broke that up and he still messed around and then he was dating another girl and i liked hold on him and that made him not like me for a while 

Recording: (4401/ 9621) 
you rather call the north show actually 

Recording: (4402/ 9621) 
yeah i do i and and if i read it every day i try to and um and i we go deterrent of all sorts of activities i do and i just always feel like i am reimbursed that it is not just some sort of play idea that it is for me that it is um real and and it it just always makes sense that is important to me that i feel like it makes sense 

Recording: (4403/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (4404/ 9621) 
yeah that is kind of subjective although there is a paper that we hand talk to our kids that tells exactly what is supposed to be in every part of this as i like the first the introduction repair staff is supposed to consist a consistent which tells mainly what the is going to be about and then you are just in the introduced to paragraph paragraph by listening three ideas about your thesis that you are going to develop in paragraphs two three and four so i mean it is 

Recording: (4405/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4406/ 9621) 
and he knew it was a bush at war 

Recording: (4407/ 9621) 
okay uh i have two two um students well why should not we say two two children one is a student here currently 

Recording: (4408/ 9621) 
yeah i think i have to drive on the stress  i think it keeps me uh going or something but i do have to do something that is accomplishing something i do not want to sit in an office if money down that day in and day out working for other people that i do not even approve of that are making way too much money anyway you know and after 

Recording: (4409/ 9621) 
yeah i like to go up there and play pool once in a while 

Recording: (4410/ 9621) 
then you are really going to get out of it what you need to 

Recording: (4411/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4412/ 9621) 
and i mean obviously it needed a lot of repairs because it was pretty old and they were just things that he would do and i guess just picking up watching him seeing what he would do this 

Recording: (4413/ 9621) 
that is just like i told them take everything you have got that your real father got you 

Recording: (4414/ 9621)

Recording: (4438/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4439/ 9621) 
his speed was like say seventy mile an hour before and now it is going to be twenty because he does not how to do it and that is the problem they are running into they have all these qualified airplanes and how to get them in the trail and you know everything but now they have got to do this extra part which is going to make their job easier down the road but everybody hates change so what they are doing now is it they are having problems because people can not take the volume of airplanes because they are trying to keep up with the computer so it is making it even slower yet but once they get in you know in the swing of things it will be okay but you know you are you are talking a while you know because it is not something that you can do overnight it would be like your dad learning the computer he is not going to do it overnight 

Recording: (4440/ 9621) 
and uh apparently when you are a car um they have a very very like year of toleranceance 

Recording: (4441/ 9621) 
um my family personally my parents uh my parents my father was born and raised in dayton beach my mother was born and raised in uh portsmouth ohio both of them or ohio state graduates my father was a cpa my mother was a schoolteacher but did not work out when we were kidsactually they met at last working at last yeah they both were different you know he was in oh yeah they both worked during college and i guess my dad was on the g i bill after the war so that is how he got in here and had to work some part time work to get his degree umhum it is just east broad street just frankly and park and service

of a murderer 

Recording: (4443/ 9621)

Recording: (4444/ 9621) 
oh they have been just trible kids in the past they have 

Recording: (4445/ 9621) 
not only toward with us the children but just other people also you know my mother used to feed the bums that would come from the front door and she would fix them food and so she she was a very 

Recording: (4446/ 9621) 
again with the news with uh um different bombings and uh i think the jewish school caught my attention and now that he is in day care i mean we did a pretty good screening but he is still always kind of wondering what is going on he is done quite well he is i mean he learned at his so he is always had a color he is socially learning how to play with other kids those raw things he was not doing home potty training it is been a big deal because all the other kids in class are doing it and 

Recording: (4447/ 9621) 
spended bus service 

Recording: (4448/ 9621) 
uhhuh  well speaking of acoustics i i do not know if i am you you have to tell me if i am going off the subject  or you know if you need to ask me something else okay um this is another interesting story my church choir is a very important part of the church up there on have you ever been to the church up there she does it sometime although you are only going to be here for another month the summer is not necessarily the best time because it 

Recording: (4449/ 9621) 
and i am hoping to get i am i am going to get a popina kidding together 

Recording: (4450/ 9621) 
if they are especially if they are over forty because they are companies giving money back to the community for this and that and you know that is how they are trying to show that they care about this they are trying to mentor some school or some group of kids or give money for the down trodden or you know but you are right i think it is terrible that every other country in the world has higher mosquitoes than we do better science skills than we do better language skills than we do well canadians even go to school for thirteen years not twelve you know and i just think that this efficiency thing is finally going to make people accountable 

Recording: (4451/ 9621) 
anyway and uh i am not saying in general but with the experiences that i have had um certain families where they do not uh socioe economically just not as well off 

Recording: (4452/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4453/ 9621) 
yeah quite a bit yeah i have seen us grow from the from the from the time i have you know lived here as a child you know uh one sixty one you know doubling grandville road you know i can remember when that was all country 

Recording: (4454/ 9621) 
yeah but just had to have something to go by this as opposed to say you know we have others go with it you know i mean you can not go back and try to raise i do not know if sometimes somebody was trying to rearr a calendar one time were not they 

Recording: (4455/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4456/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4457/ 9621) 
the day i left the hospital he was running around with him and he 

Recording: (4458/ 9621) 
oh okay 

Recording: (4459/ 9621) 
and i was thirty nine 

Recording: (4460/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4461/ 9621) 
i really am not educated into that at all so i would not probably say anything since i ignorant in the field 

Recording: (4462/ 9621) 
oh no we just had a whole conversation coming out 

Recording: (4463/ 9621) 
umhumumhum we do not really have that much you know uh the foreign ones um it it is probably be like maybe two or three percent of our total pilot 

Recording: (4464/ 9621) 
well he he is two main uh main characters and he is cartoon for a willie in his old 

Recording: (4465/ 9621) 
oh yeah i uh i think she really kind of knows that from conversations uh with me and stuff where she was growing up uh you know mine uh my values and stuff basically are uh more religious oriented you know uh than i would say my wife is but uh uh so i think she she knows what i value is being important what i value is being not important and but on the rest of the question you know i would i would love to be able to do but uh been out the other other weekends sounds good you know as far as uh 

Recording: (4466/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4467/ 9621) 
and that is one thing he said no 

Recording: (4468/ 9621) 
have you ever been there 

Recording: (4469/ 9621) 
oh yeah it does your 

Recording: (4470/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4471/ 9621) 
and so i got to be the first graduating class of the spring new school that they built because the old one had just overflowed beyond all recognition 

Recording: (4472/ 9621) 
um i can not say that really bothered me too much i mean it is the same thing is having a woman gym teacher or whatever 

Recording: (4473/ 9621) 
i was in seventy eight uh and then i have just i have stayed there and it is grown a lot in the work changes it is an interesting place to work because uh at first the job is almost a different job every year because so many changes are happening you know trying to stay out in front of what in front of what library invasions in front of what and thatstay out in front of corporate corporate at all so it is it you know it is kind of exciting because you know you know on things that are really new and trying to master up the project i am working on now uh just trying to find a way to to create data that describeses web resources so the library is going to take this data and put it in their catalog and then agree with the regular collection and we are doing a lot of with it yeah it is it is pretty it is a pretty neat project a lot of new things the uh job in the way give us opportunities to do things that we have talked about before but could not really do very well so it is a pretty neat 

Recording: (4474/ 9621) 
for people to read i think there is enough other resources out there if somebody is interested in getting that kind of information that they can do that uh i know for for me just because i have so many younger brothers and sisters and and my family  and everything i know how i have got some some some pretty a friend of what i feel are pretty good opinions about how to handle different things and i knew that my mom always consulting me you know like my sister you know she kind of the being in front which is enough that she she goes almost creepy she is so bright i mean she really is i mean it is one of those things where she just does not turn in her stuff you know and it is she is twelve 

Recording: (4475/ 9621) 
just a teeny bit 

Recording: (4476/ 9621) 
we are all in columbus 

Recording: (4477/ 9621) 
 that is why i started it 

Recording: (4478/ 9621) 
it was so amazing to be back in america 

Recording: (4479/ 9621) 
yeah um my i was born in new york i was in play um i then went to tennessee with my family and that was after i was six months 

Recording: (4480/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4481/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (4482/ 9621) 
he seems pretty airy den i do not think he is done quite really too much for a climate they need to get a younger coach they need some a new 

Recording: (4483/ 9621) 
the competition  

Recording: (4484/ 9621) 
hum 

Recording: (4485/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4486/ 9621) 
yeah well like um 

Recording: (4487/ 9621) 
because we wanted to be because it is a preage now because uh i got to go to another plate you know my daughter just did a play downtown with columbus junior theater and i usured it eighteen performance it because i could be free i could i did not want to pay ten bucks every time to see it but if i usured i could be in the audience every time you know and from my parents to have no interest in seeing seeing play baseball or swimpshire or iowa is land you know or in a play they they would not they do not even wanna be bothered with that that just to them is just and i can not understand that 

Recording: (4488/ 9621) 
yeah yeah so that is pretty much what she likes to do 

Recording: (4489/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4490/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (4491/ 9621) 
i do not 

Recording: (4492/ 9621) 
true communism not as it was practiced in russia but uh uh where people uh share and uh share power and share money and equally but the where we are in our evolution that we are not ready for it uh actually uh when i was in oregon i did a lot of experimenting and i lived in an attentional community which was actually trying 

Recording: (4493/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4494/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4495/ 9621) 
oh okay 

Recording: (4496/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4497/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (4498/ 9621) 
so because he and i always discuss politics and so 

Recording: (4499/ 9621) 
ah 

Recording: (4500/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4501/ 9621) 
they are generally tends to be at least one or two republicans they vote for each each election and sometimes i voted straight democrat because i just you know i even voted for doorney peter the first time she ran for county commission or uh because i liked her style and i thought she was nice and then i liked what she was saying but then her votes later on and her positions on some of the issues were against my so i did not vote for her after that but the first time she ran for county commission i did at one because she was a woman and i like you know i it was not possible i like to vote for women 

Recording: (4502/ 9621) 
and i had two little girls and i thought wait a minute you know i my whole life changed because my commitment was to them and to you know get all the opportunities that were out there for them and and it just did not happen that you know we that we both out the same he wanted everything to be the same you know so i think that really changed everything once of it does your whole focus changes because everything you say somebody is listening and everything you want to do somebody is watching and 

Recording: (4503/ 9621) 
you are gonna 

Recording: (4504/ 9621) 
yeah well you get these you probably heard on the news these uh fifteen murders or so since nineteen ninety one on the outside and then you have got all these people you know have been in the fights in my neighborhood and while my old neighborhood and you know fights people breaking in stealing your stuff and just all out out landish behavior i mean i caught i actually wrote up on uh a couple people down the street from me he having sacks throwofdents  

Recording: (4505/ 9621) 
i am so much more relaxed i mean the pressures that these kids these days have on um and you are right without families at home to give them the garden i mean it calling by the phone not mistaken that was the one who had the journal who had somebody had made bombs in the garage and the family did not know about it and was like how can a family know that and go that but they are they are so busy and working and trying to provide sure 

Recording: (4506/ 9621) 
and then uh uptending grad school 

Recording: (4507/ 9621) 
bye midwest though 

Recording: (4508/ 9621)

Recording: (4509/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4510/ 9621) 
yeah they are just so 

Recording: (4511/ 9621) 
yeah because they go back in three days 

Recording: (4512/ 9621) 
some of the ordinary people we are both into genealogy on our respected families and you can find all that out i watch your families and you start going that in fact you me you forgot one that i found i had if you remember me road at their library in pennsylvania and i he came back and was sitting there laughing and i am trying to laugh out loud and he said what so funny uh all the names i am looking for from all my family he is funny things for his family and everything i said you were and i found one of them way back in what was it sixteen seventy or something this boat load of people had come over from england and they were the ones that had been deported from england because they had done something against the government or something like you know stolen or worth the thief or something and i said would you be the only person i got to find out my family is nothing but a convict  you know you even got people toed  from the country i do not know why you whether that that is a ship he was on 

Recording: (4513/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (4514/ 9621) 
ah 

Recording: (4515/ 9621) 
i think i like if you had to ask it to say i was a straight midwestern suburban night but there are people that i go to school with and actually there is twenty five thousand like in the city 

Recording: (4516/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (4517/ 9621) 
it it does not have to cost anything but you you can go do it with your family or whatever so yeah 

Recording: (4518/ 9621) 
go forward they are always stopping something and they just seemed to move forward very well 

Recording: (4519/ 9621) 
now i do not either because i believe in the death penalty and i feel taken a life like that leaving someone there just to die 

Recording: (4520/ 9621) 
and she went back to them 

Recording: (4521/ 9621) 
that would be two hundred dollars a month 

Recording: (4522/ 9621) 
they really have no self worth because you know uh i know a long time ago i we went to a uh uh it was like a a seminar for the ivy league schools which i looked at the tuition went uh you know there was no way but and i thought this is so stupid to be here but i listened to the man that there was like four or five men talking and some women talking whatever and uh they said you know if your if your child makes straight a is and uh supplies at our school we do not want them then i am like one he says uh he says we look at two two children sitting side by the side this one is making straight a is this one is sort of made beef but this one over here gone into track when he or she was in freshmen and and we noticed every track meat they basically was were like last or second to last but they did it for four years then they 

Recording: (4523/ 9621) 
beinggoopy  

Recording: (4524/ 9621) 
you know that stuff like that is always been around but it seems now that the guns are more you can get them easier let us say me i could be carrying a gun right now what are they going to do to me 

Recording: (4525/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (4526/ 9621) 
so yeah i think um as a whole we have all kind of gone our separate ways which is scary i mean we do not have the same believe system and anything anymore so it is kind of like oh jeez  

Recording: (4527/ 9621) 
if they 

Recording: (4528/ 9621) 
and the safety of the neighborhood and it that there are a few things really to go into 

Recording: (4529/ 9621) 
do you really 

Recording: (4530/ 9621) 
around more than the meal 

Recording: (4531/ 9621) 
i think that those four kids at least among my grandchildren are getting pretty much at the same training that i did or maybe better than i got uh my oldest son is two daughters or well they are good kids and they are smart kids but they do not think that they have uh moral grounding that uh big and busy kids do you said this is all of a  

Recording: (4532/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4533/ 9621) 
and move on um that is that is basically my fear but uh as one of the guys trying to help me said well listen i am afraid of that too they say right there in that pit there that is god now if you remember that there is nothing in here that can hurt you even as hot as it gets you know and when you think about that you try not to think too much while you are in there although it is hard to do especially if you are thinking about how hot it is but if you are listening to people playing and they are playing with their heart and i tell you because of the how hot it gets in there you will hear people play straight from their heart on a bunch of real fancy words and and a real comfortable setting you know that that he 

Recording: (4534/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (4535/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4536/ 9621) 
berman came alabama

Recording: (4542/ 9621) 
no i never did i i do not know of many people that do but but it was also for me i think if i know something is true i i just know it and then as long as it keeps on being true over and over again if it is not just some exciting thing that for one day it is like oh this is great but like six months later it still has the same still raining true and a year later two years later then that is how i feel 

Recording: (4543/ 9621)

mothers he used to be a principal of mine in elementary school so uh he is like i i think we should talk i was like okay great because i do not think uh boy are we too serious for this particular thing okay so i do not know we knew it but we knew it but we knew it all of the laws were coming to and door anyway so i i um at this point in the story i should point out that the paper that i went downstairs for i do not know where that is i never found it never saw it never it it is anyway not relevant at all of the story but it bugs me every time i told the story because it does not exist anyway and so now we come back in line it is like well i have got some bad news and my sister is like what yeah and i go oh okay go ahead and he is like no i i think your shoulds of down i am like all right 

Recording: (4582/ 9621) 
 yeah  

Recording: (4583/ 9621) 
we have a yeah we have 

Recording: (4584/ 9621) 
the herbsbs  the herbs 

Recording: (4585/ 9621) 
i used to when i was driving though especially when i was going through the uh going to two seventy things you know that people flip me off and stuff like that and the funny thing one time a guy is flipping me off because he was going slow and uh my uh all of a test off about him went around him and everything you know and i go to the more pointed to him chemical and it pulls in beside me but then i look already and it looks at me like oh you know they 

Recording: (4586/ 9621) 
yeah it is supposed to be an alternative type to the public schools where they can hopefully get a little bit more of the discipline that they may have not 

Recording: (4587/ 9621) 
i think more what they need to do is restrict or uh just make stiffer penalties to people that carry the guns or that are involved in shooting and things like that um because i mean for the most part i mean people really do not get too badly punished for things i mean if you look in other countries i people like the asian countries places like that i mean they have really strict laws i mean if you even get caught for like vandalism yourself serving jail time to get you get pretty badly punished for it i mean some cases they even change you up and beat you in public for it um and i think not to sound too ventful but i think if more things went that way that there would be a much less problem with it uh i think just the fact that the jails are so overcrowded now that they know that they can get good time in parole and all sorts of stuff that if you shoot someone you are you are not even going to get thirty days in jail and you can be like oh i mean that is an awfully small price to pay for 

Recording: (4588/ 9621) 
i am just more of a conservative person i mean i am not sure exactly what his platform is but i have seen him speak a couple of times and i do not know he just impresses me more than 

Recording: (4589/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4590/ 9621) 
man it was rough 

Recording: (4591/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4592/ 9621) 
that is probably what i do i ignore to them till like august starts are just lying and starts paying attention 

Recording: (4593/ 9621) 
i mean there is always been the nerves and uh i do not know when i was growing up in the seventies there really was not punk or anything like that and i think uh unfortunately i mean there is always going to be all different kinds of people to make the world but it they have just pushed it to an extreme certain kinds of kids and you know they want to i saw you know i watch all these shows day line and 20 twenty all the reforming of shows and how one was in texas run over one of the punk was run over by uh um a jog 

Recording: (4594/ 9621) 
and decided to pursue the matter to the extent of marriage so that is where they meant  no huhuh i i come down here two or three times like you know just trips through going to the airport and other miscellaneous things but uh when i moved to the city i mean it was a real real big change because i you know used to living in the country and then i am moving to smackab and the middle of the downtown area 

Recording: (4595/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4596/ 9621) 
well i am saying the 

Recording: (4597/ 9621) 
it is that is weird  

Recording: (4598/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4599/ 9621) 
well i mean to me the whole thing is wrong regardless of if you are guilty or innocent there to me there is worse worse things i would think than than dying you know the you look i know in israel the guy who kills it so hundred and three he got locked up and he is not allowed to see it because it um under jewish law you can not kill 

Recording: (4600/ 9621) 
and i have a wife been married thirteen years have two kids age five and seven both of them one is in second grade and the other one is still in day care at a high state university 

Recording: (4601/ 9621) 
right and if he if he is open minded enough to do it eventually he will see the light and say well this is makes it a lot easier but there are people who are like i will not do this you know so those are the ones that have to be drug screaming and kicking 

Recording: (4602/ 9621) 
it is salt water fish 

Recording: (4603/ 9621) 
um i mean at that point i i certainly did not have any real knowledge about any of that sort of thing uh you know they covered the basics uh they did talk about condom is and on texan i remember we watched a film which everyone was very embarrassed but um i mean i do not really they i they did send home a package to the parents because i remember being really upset and i do not want to my mom to talk with me about it 

Recording: (4604/ 9621) 
yeah pro creationation part of what marriage is all about but i see marriages more than just propaganda 

Recording: (4605/ 9621) 
and she run a fork lift into a pool  in from  most of her nose and chipped her two she is a dangerous woman  and uh so uh she gets a lot of ticket sometimes as long as she is not getting her yeah so she is not running in the pool  and stuff um and you know we will use them because they do not they normally go to the movie store and just get a movie in break home we do that a lot too but 

Recording: (4606/ 9621) 
yeah the same thing you were talking about and uh we were only the third people to live in it and so it needed everything you know and it had gold car now gold back but in those days everything was like gold and you know and green it was horrible and uh it was great fun we had we had a lot of fun we we took the back porch and made a part of the kitchen and had another back porch put on the finished the third floor and added a family room and another bedroom we put an ing round pool and so i always joke because what i paid for it i know all three times that amount on it 

Recording: (4607/ 9621) 
and theasinand expression or the expression on that phase can be equally effective as the smack uh on the bottom uh with a bare hand or a switch or whatever it may be i know the money the most effective penalty for me was my mother uh would uh go out near a tree and she would break a twig uh off and she would smack me across the shoulder and you know it left marks but it and it sure it hurts i mean it was staying and i understood exactly what was meant now i think i grew up and i have been it up being i think a quite successful person and i think my mother had uh uh thirteen of the fifteen children who lived uh all pretty doggoneous and kids and none of us were injured and none of them were hurt uh and that was a basic method of penalty it it was not something that truly her injured uh not today however uh i suspect my mom could usually be uh could have been charged with abuse of child abuse because it left a mark across my shoulder where is that uh green switch it is always a green switch because uh these old ones they would break you do not want them to break  

Recording: (4608/ 9621) 
you know tennis shoes and 

Recording: (4609/ 9621) 
yeah i i you know get on her to make sure she sits down and reads with them you know because i do put when i get home with them i you know sit down and do the abc is one two three is but he loves to read books so i try to get her to do that instead of just let them play all day and 

Recording: (4610/ 9621) 
i would like to be you know but she lives i keep telling her  she would move down here but i am not moving to in toledo  i do not like toledo

yeah right  

Recording: (4612/ 9621) 
i am just an operator right now i have done production work too for them 

Recording: (4613/ 9621) 
um i mean they did not really do anything too expensive on it they basically as far as religion classes you know they would basically told up the catholic church believed about it and how they felt about it but they did not really today am more supported or anything they got to move they they basically did realize that it is more up to the person they mean 

Recording: (4614/ 9621) 
interactive they are 

Recording: (4615/ 9621) 
well a little bit near the beginning and that was pretty miserable but it is been spent a while from there so that is not something that that right now i have had any anything like that so 

Recording: (4616/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4617/ 9621) 
umhum yeah but but many people especially the kids that young may not know what that really means and may it to be part of the group and part of the you know be cool may go along with it when really they do not like it i do not i have not made up my mind about him whether he is telling the truth or whether he has not or whether he was not 

Recording: (4618/ 9621) 
yeah it got boring it got frustrating because we uh you get these new people moving in and you know you used to it everything being nice you know and then get people next door breaking into your upstairs from your breaking into it is just 

Recording: (4619/ 9621) 
oh my 

Recording: (4620/ 9621) 
we want a dog and we have kind of been waiting um but i like both animals 

Recording: (4621/ 9621)

Recording: (4623/ 9621) 
oh no 

Recording: (4624/ 9621) 
umhum sure 

Recording: (4625/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (4626/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4627/ 9621) 
yeah or yeah i mean uh it is a tough one you know you get kids that are doing softball soccer you know all these events and you know like on thursdays when the daughter plays softball my wife leaves the house at eight thirty and she usually drives from work to the softball and after that she home by nine so she is like i can see how you fall into this drive through window business you know but luckily you know i pick the kids up so that helps a lot and i can get them home we can i can feed them and i can get them so that is our life is mister mom 

Recording: (4628/ 9621) 
well i was with um i am mormon so we i do not know if you have ever seen how they go two by two always and i was with what we call another sister i was and we would live in an apartment and we would pay for our own mission and there was a mission president and they had different people was responsible these liters and they would watch over you and make sure you know call in the every night and check on you but it was really up to us what we wanted to do we were we would get up and leave at nine thirty and be home by nine thirty or whatever it got dark 

Recording: (4629/ 9621) 
that is pretty good never had to borrow any money never went on welfare did not i think i have gone food steps or something for a month 

Recording: (4630/ 9621) 
i forget the name well i do not think there is a university of portland but there is two two or yes there is a university i can not think of which one it is right now but speaking of opinions did you see the paper today about the thing in seattle they are having this big  whoa fight is in 

Recording: (4631/ 9621) 
yeah and i do not know tennessee is been out of tennessee for i do not know a year 

Recording: (4632/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4633/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4634/ 9621) 
it is story elements 

Recording: (4635/ 9621) 
they are the huge one so i do not know yeah 

Recording: (4636/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4637/ 9621) 
oh okay 

Recording: (4638/ 9621) 
but the federal government and our lawyers have done that in the department of the interior still considered native americans on the same level as a dog they do not have price or something wrong there and it still goes on a day after about six hundred years and we have got good people in this country that want to do something about it but unfortunately you know what i am finding you you got everybody is got to choose their path 

Recording: (4639/ 9621) 
right right 

Recording: (4640/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (4641/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (4642/ 9621) 
well in the future 

Recording: (4643/ 9621) 
yeah really 

Recording: (4644/ 9621) 
yeah i do not know if you remember you might not be quite old enough but you may know the song danaoconnor nothing compares to you  when 

Recording: (4645/ 9621) 
uh while they are uh lot of happy stripers in town so or i should not say because all they can do so 

Recording: (4646/ 9621) 
i mean probably down the line because they we are still struggling to get up you know we are waiting for that million dollar check they got it 

Recording: (4647/ 9621) 
so now he is back in the long care until something else better comes along 

Recording: (4648/ 9621) 
and i it just i know it sounds crazy but i would rather have ten animals and take care of them and different kinds of animals than children i do not know why uh i knew at a very young age that i it just was not important to me it would not be a part of my life 

Recording: (4649/ 9621) 
i know another thing about the kids nowadays is that uh devent i experienced it with her you know as uh i sent her hundred dollars one time you know just for her and she said to her and said uh i called her up a couple of days later or or about a week a week later or something like that uh said what would you do with that uh what would you give me that money and everything he said well you know i would bought a gap tshirt in a uh cd and i said uhhuh she goes uh what you mean uhhuh that is what i bought and i said you bought a cd and bought a blouse 

Recording: (4650/ 9621) 
you know that is a real major question that uh no i do not think it is too bad i mean uh well uh well we could go into the issue of uh the columbus board of education what is his name he is always 

Recording: (4651/ 9621) 
i do not had a strong uh public uh support over there so it is a really tightening community it is uh quite different columbus needs are learning a lot from that area and uh it is a matter of just uh putting uh i guess your hands in the you are practicing your faith which we 

Recording: (4652/ 9621) 
open of that tunnel and they fired a couple of our shelves into the tunnel and then took off 

Recording: (4653/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4654/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4655/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (4656/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4657/ 9621) 
yeah so you know his friend lives on the other side you know it is like a duplex and his friend lives on the other side and he uh he also was uh broken into but he came through his bathroom window 

Recording: (4658/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (4659/ 9621) 
and that is so sad for our city 

Recording: (4660/ 9621) 
um so they are coming up and i there is been like divorce papers and stuff and i know that police officers are occasionally used to deliver important documents i do not personally think the the worst documents are that important but nothing is down there on the possibility for people taking this way out way too seriously yes 

Recording: (4661/ 9621) 
well see we have real traditional uh breakdown of of choice but only because that is just happened to be what we liked it the way we like it do you know what i mean and it is it is not um because you know i consider i my whole house all a lot of feminine you know we are all real strong about that but that is again since i have the luxury of being at home and peter is doing a job that he really enjoys and i am doing something i enjoy i really am happy to do all of those things that typically women do because that is my job that is my trade off you know i do not have to go some place south i can get i can go and have coffee every day with my daughters i can go you do whatever i want and i am happy to do these other things 

Recording: (4662/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4663/ 9621) 
i think that is that would be really fun i have never done it but it always looks like so much fun to me 

Recording: (4664/ 9621) 
yeah exactly medicaid i think i think it is 

Recording: (4665/ 9621) 
everyday the other one i do not see that much anymore 

Recording: (4666/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (4667/ 9621) 
i do not think that changed my mind about anything i mean i do not approve of his imm world behavior but it does not change the way he runs the country 

Recording: (4668/ 9621) 
um umhum 

Recording: (4669/ 9621) 
yeah i contribute it to too many people there is too many people there is not enough commitment it is too easy to get divorced and uh the competition i mean there is just tons and tons of uh just people everywhere and young people today i do not uh you know i do not know what the state is are going to be but they i do not think they have a good idea of what marriage even is you know before and also before marriage was a commitment to uh a type of life style in that lifestyle gone everybody is independent everybody is going their own ways and if you happen to be lucky enough to find somebody that is looking in the same direction you are and as equally as independent then it might it might work but uh i you know and he knows why each person gets divorced i mean each one of them was an individual situation and uh 

Recording: (4670/ 9621) 
oh that is great  

Recording: (4671/ 9621) 
exactly 

Recording: (4672/ 9621) 
just just kind of instincts i guess yeah actually there are quite a there is a an a a well pretty well known doctor that has a ton of books and i go to l atl league and that is kind of their philosophy in a way yeah just that breast feeding is you know a way to mother and herter and feed and you know it it meets all of these needs it is kind of like it is justhuh umhum uhhuh oh well one of my l into league leaders she has a phd and she does a lot of reading and she said that she actually run a study that they did um from breast fed babies to bottle fed babies and they said the difference in their iq is equivalent to uh a regular bottle fed baby and a baby exposed to lead poisoning it is that much higher even so i mean it is just given them not much of a better head start on development so  

Recording: (4673/ 9621) 
yeah but um some names are just like we had a friend once that she got pregnant like after her two boys were almost grown up and they did not ever expect to have another kid and her mother died during a pregnancy so she named the little girl after her mother and the mother is name was harry it 

Recording: (4674/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4675/ 9621) 
a policeer computers that my plants sit in the corner and then have my little paper sack 

Recording: (4676/ 9621) 
so i you know they pile hey you resemb that remark you know 

Recording: (4677/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4678/ 9621) 
where are you from 

Recording: (4679/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (4680/ 9621) 
well i think all through growing up there is always been you know different kind of kids 

Recording: (4681/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4682/ 9621) 
uh that is what he does he is not around for his own farming although his major pastime is going out on his tractor mowing lawn and then doing other miscellaneous things he was a nice just factors he was really nice just tractors but uh and he was he was raised in suburbia so the the tractor thing is a whole new thing for him so he is you know he really he really does a nice yard he is from rochester new york yeahum actually uh one of my dad is really good friends went to the same church nomination that my mom did and my dad went with his friend and to a summer camp that they had and that is where they actually first met and my dad was extremely taken with her 

Recording: (4683/ 9621) 
 do you have it three oclock 

Recording: (4684/ 9621) 
now i had a cat that just died 

Recording: (4685/ 9621) 
oh yeah it is gonna be unconditional love out there 

Recording: (4686/ 9621) 
yeah they do i thought it was really cool we went hiking in the alps and somebody told us that uh 

Recording: (4687/ 9621) 
for that for for that so he he got locked up and he is not allowed to see another human being 

Recording: (4688/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (4689/ 9621) 
 you know 

Recording: (4690/ 9621) 
that has a lot to do with the fact that the that they the church 

Recording: (4691/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4692/ 9621) 
i think it was just great was the first 

Recording: (4693/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (4694/ 9621) 
i think that is kind of where i am coming from jan and i know you uh jan and i mean what my sister does i just say to her i just certainly admire it i can not give as much as she gives like i just do not have that same spirit she has but uh it is great to see i mean she is real she really when she is with the people i do not know i have this thing probably about me that you know you can stand on your own two feet and you can lead a better life but jana just develops them with her kind of and uh probably has less expectations from the people i she works with 

Recording: (4695/ 9621) 
ah i would be surprised 

Recording: (4696/ 9621) 
time to go i made i am down here  

Recording: (4697/ 9621) 
i do not think so now with the diversity that we have here 

Recording: (4698/ 9621) 
get back to god get back to leaving in god in the values that the families should have i do not know how is that connected well god did not teach you to go out and shoot your neighbor and he did not go out and tell you to steal from him and he did not tell you to uh ignore him the rest of your life he did not tell you that they are down there bleeding into the they do not have a wall street in the other way i mean he do not want you to help and be loving toward each other and and it is liking a lot of people today as i said they would back that old me me me thing or i i i really want to say i really think that that is most of it and i do not know how people i got a letter the other day and i can not remember the name of the personality that was doing it i really could not stand to you can find up to taking them right in and say do not have these kind of tv programs on any more where they use their for penalty where they use the dope and uh where they use of all getity and i understand this thing about him being or her her being at him what what is what is what we are going to be looking for right now than i am blown  uh 

Recording: (4699/ 9621) 
um college wise i do not know anyone of college age that is okay 

Recording: (4700/ 9621) 
i do not feel like i have heaned anything from it that i did not deserve i mean 

Recording: (4701/ 9621) 
right she is one of the last year 

Recording: (4702/ 9621) 
yeah i yeah for them to go to a deck yeah i would think it would for them to interact with the kids more yeah but where he goes there is he is got ill with cousins and stuff that with him so 

Recording: (4703/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4704/ 9621) 
uh uh i have one daughter thirty six years old she lives in toledo and then i have two grandchildren 

Recording: (4705/ 9621) 
i know 

Recording: (4706/ 9621) 
oh i have to eat it that is nice  

Recording: (4707/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (4708/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4709/ 9621) 
and come back in 

Recording: (4710/ 9621) 
uh a little bit north of north broad away right along the freeway there but it did not used to be a bad neighborhood but now it is just kind of you get the little kids growing up and doing shit that you know  you picture yourself going at the child one way or another you know you know you throw throw rocks around and stuff and actually throw the brick window around away  

Recording: (4711/ 9621) 
that is true sometimes we have trouble finding enough they oldest or something you know an instrument like that um but they they usually get enough to play a concert sometimes we have to bring in a couple of instrumentalists for last few rehearsals so we sort of have stringers i guess you would call them  yeah we have actually been on wsu also uh radio on music in mid ohio uh our recording last year yeah of beethoven is ninth gone on music in mid ohio  yeah the beat daughter behind college choir 

Recording: (4712/ 9621) 
well i would i would sit down and talk to her like you know if you want to have sex if you really want to have sex you should get on some kind of birth control 

Recording: (4713/ 9621) 
yeah well like i i play music and stuff with all my friends i do not know basically just like standard teenage stuff sitting around off in tv and like i do not know just running around or whatever but like um high school is always feel like like you know you put in like a tiny little bit of effort and you get like a beat and that is it and that is good enough i guess 

Recording: (4714/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4715/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4716/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4717/ 9621) 
so from a year again and ended up getting there right after i finished my masters 

Recording: (4718/ 9621) 
not yet  

Recording: (4719/ 9621) 
during school but at the same time i mean as long as the parents love the kids it does not really matter what sex they are and they treat them well um so i mean that is kind of a tough question to answer i mean it is almost it is something that they almost need to ask the kids but obviously at the age they would be adopting them they obviously would not know how to answer that question yeah 

Recording: (4720/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4721/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4722/ 9621) 
bustbader got there she started out somewhere 

Recording: (4723/ 9621) 
yeah yeah she probably got uh i do not know maybe even she sold drugs or you know whatever kind of way she made her money but it would not have been enough welfare wise to get a car into 

Recording: (4724/ 9621) 
but it is mind boggling that is because i came from a small community there were only two hundred people in my senior class and you knew everybody and now you are talking to whole high schools too football teams you know it is just mind boggling all these people you know you graduate with you know and know a half a handful of people and do not know anybody else like you know a lot more of uh tightening group as a child so we had three elementary schools and one high school and that was it 

Recording: (4725/ 9621) 
because considerable they wanted uh what was it a two dollar raise or something but and then they also get free tuition but only as i understand it only a very small percentage get that free tuition or like 

Recording: (4726/ 9621) 
well but see i think if you really try to tell kids and especially women that you know you should sex is something that should be between two people that love each other and unless you really feel love and really think it is loved and you know you should not do it

all of creation into religion all of what spirituality is into one word religion you you can not um but when you say it is a spirit of spiritual nature that is you know that is still leaving the door wide open that it is it is abroad it is bigger than you ever may uh but that uh that whole thing is um you know the people that they did not have a specific instructions of how to do things and i am not saying they were perfect either there were a lot of in name people and there are a lot of indians people out there that are cro becauseous adults on the way to it it is just the way to it they are corrupt the money is corrupt them the lack of money has corrupted them power has corrupted them uh they want to be a spiritual leader why i do not know um uh to me it is an ego thing and uh this rain believe the guy had some kind of buffalo uh uh what did he call it a buffalo sar charge everybody but they charge everybody they people do not want to come learn about that i mean traditional native people that you you do not charge people that want to come to learn about god there is some people in california that say certain be where have a native thing and they bury a woman in the ground with a straw daughter with some ritual of proving and overcoming fear yet the lady was an astrofoam adic and she was claustrophobic and lost the straw in her mouth and he could not breath and brief and all this sand and died and so the first thing they put in the paper is that another native saramony shows is how native american spiritualities should be outlawed and if you look at any kind of uh spiritually religion that is out there native americans all the ones that have legislation actually saying what you can and can not have that there is blood quantum saying that if you have a fourth or a half

but he just did not have a very high opinion of the ori 

Recording: (4746/ 9621) 
everybody is 

Recording: (4747/ 9621) 
so um it seems the picture is kind of hard to deal with people that are in to capitalism have a pretty good lives and they have what they want and they do not seem to have such serious problems so people who try to go against that current can get to ourselves into big trouble so and capitalism has made the united states go i mean it has worked uh and we are ahead of the world there is no question about that in what the individual people persons have and how their lives go much better on the other hand um you know i am i am actually well i would like for uh if it would just spread all over the world true communism 

Recording: (4748/ 9621) 
of the people that land that there is in this the saramony calling it an e b which is a sweat large and a lot of people will talk about the sweat large um and involves heating up stones in a fire and uh putting the stones in uh lodge and pouring water over them and closing the door and singing songs it is not a songs it is not a uh steam room

no 

Recording: (4752/ 9621) 
you know  

Recording: (4753/ 9621) 
he had a variety uh eighth grade is when he was probably in some of his better year uh he was taking a had taken computer class for grading period and uh it was not going while they were teaching keybording well he learned that when he was in third grade so we were talking to the teacher about he says we have been ask him if he is the be doing keyboarding exercises and he is writing programs so it was and he said i knew the first day he knew everything and i was going to teach this going to for any period while that kind of flew up a red fly to me and he said can you give him other assignments i do not know he is got to do whatever this is doing so we went to the principal and i was president of the the parents advisory committee at the time so my easy access to the principal he took them out of the class immediately and put them in the library the library and worked with him one on one teaching data base and spreadsheet at applications to him but then if he had another teacher in the ninth grade who contacted with us is english teacher and he he is it is told us to say he does everything i will not teach so i want your permission to give him a separate curriculum and she did she he was using reading books like invisible man come uh element ellison ellison ralph ellison and element i guess it is anyway um and writing papers on he is reading like three books by an author named trying to write short story in all through style and she still tested him with the other kids just to be sure she had not missed he had not missed anything and she he was using her grad school in the good story of the papers and stuff like this and uh it was he loved it and that is what he needed but we got to high school and we would talk to teachers about this and no they could not do that uh it was very frustrated it is frightening 

Recording: (4754/ 9621) 
or american literature or you know anything you know 

Recording: (4755/ 9621) 
no no not at all it is not much in 

Recording: (4756/ 9621) 
probably going to write him again you know and uh then a lot of them i do not think are capable while in their present condition i know like that part of my name i am talking about there is no way in how they could hold down the job 

Recording: (4757/ 9621) 
yeah it is great you know and they like it they say i guess all in the you know interact with other kids and learn to use the library you know nowadays you know people do not go to the library so much either on the get your information off the other night or you buy a book or you know you you know so i just we have felt that if we in in dinner do some now that hopefully this will lead on later and this way you can monitor their television we let them rent a couple of movies here and there but we see what they rent already you know take out compared to uh you know the cartoon network and all these great uh it is just cartoons just seems so worthless nowadays but actually you will watch some of the older cartoons that we watched and they seem more violent than some of the new ones you know daffy dunk in the red around and they started playing all it was was killed the folks you know they they just so we are just like pretty strong i mean you know you think of disney and you think of kids which is still a lot of the stuff they put out this pretty hard core for five year old or something you know a lot of the dinosaurs and all kinds of stuff it is it isoh yeah absolutely yeah it is tough sometimes  to read the paper it is yeah yeah like this five year i am addicted to the taur is came and he likes taur is came movie that was out so yeah he wants to  so we have kind of boyed it  the daughter would not throw it away  never do not have to watch that again 

Recording: (4758/ 9621) 
and it she is kind of big test that she is my height but the baby is like oh under and you do not see it i mean unless you push your shirt down 

Recording: (4759/ 9621) 
but they just do not get any of that 

Recording: (4760/ 9621) 
uh i plan at this point to pursue history to the phd level uh anything of course can happen 

Recording: (4761/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (4762/ 9621) 
well i know but you know it it struck me as funny at the time because that is the way it was worded  

Recording: (4763/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (4764/ 9621) 
um yeah well it was like i kind of just like stopped going to class and and like and then i just like ended up with wrong because i would like fail at everything anyway so but um and i was living with my friend for a while um but and then like no i no mean her and my other friend live in down mean her 

Recording: (4765/ 9621) 
so you are 

Recording: (4766/ 9621) 
you have to go to dances you have to do that whole thing so i really do not know how how how they would go about doing that perhaps like i know we used to have like uh we had like the administrators actually allowed us to have uh a day where everyone like the whole class as a class could go have a picnic like in the practice football field and that was cool because everyone got along those days because you did not have to go to class you know you spend the second half of the day just hanging out so everyone got along that way and i think that would be a start you know but then that hurts the the the administrators in the sense that they are they are providing education so it would be rough and like my high school they they put up camera cameras and they had like they locked bathrooms like at certain times you could not go in on it it was getting and they had like we had a front page of the actrbea control because they had a lock down where no one was allowed to leave their classroom and then they brought this the dog is threw and they found i was surprised they found a lot of drugs 

Recording: (4767/ 9621) 
they prevent it from doing much yeah yeah i just do not think that they can do much and i and i am sure it is very frustrating for them well and i know is i uh we have a friend who is that was a teacher she just retired a couple of years ago she went to our age and uh it seems very different though uh you know it is she said it is scary going into the classroom sometimes uh and before it was not that you knew that if you had a problem you could make a you know go and get something down with it now you can not get backing on it 

Recording: (4768/ 9621) 
so he would not have to pay for it 

Recording: (4769/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (4770/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4771/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4772/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4773/ 9621) 
oh exactly i am planning on just staying in the house if i can or what not yeah oh yeah yeah i know i mean we are going to get some water in what night because you do not know people might turn things off like you said 

Recording: (4774/ 9621) 
i wish they could work on tech 

Recording: (4775/ 9621) 
yeah and and never got any better then they got in marching band and they ran that for four years and sometimes we noticed they march and sometimes they did not because they did not learn their music but they stayed with it and they said then they like volunteered down at coast to eye they did not get paid a dime for this but they did it because they enjoyed helping and definitely they they go we want that student over there said you as a straight a student have proved nothing to us and you over there as a b student have proved that by gosh you know you will try out for something and if you do not do well you go but i like doing it and i am going to keep with it you know and to me the straight age students who does nothing it is like the kids who go to school and shoot people they have nothing in their life at all and the other one has you know activities and they are giving themselves to the community you know you know like my both my daughters have like volunteered for the library reading program and then they went on and they volunteer at coast to eye and and my oldest one was in key club and they would have like easter egg hunts for that school is uh grade school and it is attached to columbous alternative high school so uh you know i i read them um a uh resume that she put in for a scholarship and it was explaining how the the of course she got to crying at school was when she would uh do these projects because she says there were kids there that she knew had no easter candy and it was just they were just so excited that the kids went out and bought like a dollar or two so they can not even hit it out and they would have an easter egg hunt for them at school and she says you know those are the things that were important to her and you know to me that makes you feel like you are worth something but the kids that go you know the ones that went to school i you know i do not see any community service or i do not know about i i am not a big gung ho have to be religious person i mean i i feel i am a christian but i am not a church goer and i do not think you have to go there to be a religious person you know but uh you know i think religion and community service and feeling like you have given something to the community and you know you are just not asking continuously for it you know and and trying things and feeling at them and going okay well but i still like to play basketball i am terrible but i like to play and i can not make the teams so what i do i know i will go to the y and play there you know that that is what keeps kids out of trouble and those that go to school and come home and either sit on the computer and you know uh do the check room stuff or the eat mail stuff or sit down the a play with video games i think those are the big problem with children because that you know mom and dad go how can i get them to do something instead of my hair oh i know i will buy them and then tend to i will buy them this they get i will buy them this look they are out of my way you know because you know 

Recording: (4776/ 9621) 
oh yeah fine now that comes back to your statement what do they tell us we need well now what do you need you need a refrigerator you need frost free you need all these things you know what you going street see them at garage sales you have and then you ask people why did you buy them oh we thought we needed them 

Recording: (4777/ 9621)

Recording: (4778/ 9621) 
um like i said it would just be the old generations with uh black president where now it would be part of old generations that would still have a problem with it and i think that would be a bigger number 

Recording: (4779/ 9621) 
they are kind of like more isolated here and proagill 

Recording: (4780/ 9621) 
umhum i have had i got a couple of three applications end about the kroger is and uh uh uh a do is of course of general or san angeles nursing home which i kind of like doing and stuff for people like that you know uh i worked at a castroofia on how to hunt robinia i was uh home for the age but i had a problem dealing with the one one basis with the older patients because they were they were just visiting you know they were not doing their to the same uh they are you know you get kind of on a personal basis with them then take a couple of days off me come in and say what happened to you was she passed away i am just on the jeez this could not uh i told her i was bringing her pack of cigarettes you know i mean you know you get you know you can not even uh you know you get you know you can not even taste to them to them and everything and or then they get sick sick you know and they move them up to uh i just always sit down and say you know this is the only place i have ever worked with i move up stairs in a promotion you know is 

Recording: (4781/ 9621)

Recording: (4782/ 9621) 
to be careful of that i asked my manager the other day she told me i am supposed to do this certain bank and i asked her i said well they told me i was not supposed to 

Recording: (4783/ 9621) 
i do that every once in a while just like when i get bored 

Recording: (4784/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4785/ 9621) 
just because uh uh women have a medicine you know and probably because that was lacking in my life uh i could not focus on what i need to focus on what i heard on woman is voice in there but then some of the others have me down uh and the other thing about theso longhoges men go in there in shorts women go in there in a long cotton dress you will hear people say you know in their naked 

Recording: (4786/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4787/ 9621)

Recording: (4788/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (4789/ 9621) 
so it was one of those 

Recording: (4790/ 9621) 
no they are not it is printed at the top every on every issue that they are financially independent 

Recording: (4791/ 9621) 
is that i think i remember it like they were like remodeling a few years back is that right 

Recording: (4792/ 9621) 
no no no it is not you can do whatever you want they are uh i have heard conference where the uh i have heard the profit talk about how you should keep in touch with people that you served and for the people that you worked with and that you knew and and that they even if they can not or you can not remember how to speak just trying  and send them on and i have been really bad about that so i feel a lot of pressure i need it i mean it is it i just do not one of these contact with them because you get these great friendships and but yeah you can there is i know people that have married people from there i mean that is really not supposed to happen while you are on your vision but when you you know when you are done if you wanna go back um is that happens too but it is really not looked i mean you should not that is against the rules on the mission uh if the people want to get married when they get home to that is fine but um yeah it is it is it is another thing where you are focused trying to focus on your work and you know a lot to date never alone  so and um but you can live where you serve to you can do whatever you want after you are done 

Recording: (4793/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4794/ 9621) 
in a fashion that makes it almost to i metrically opposed to mine at great many times but at the same the the free religion understanding of something 

Recording: (4795/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (4796/ 9621)

definitely i am such a slacker of yours  

Recording: (4799/ 9621) 
i forget they have uh like way more than like they dwarf in the other state i think so that to me is not that is not adroable and then i i so that is one reason i would not vote for bush 

Recording: (4800/ 9621) 
right so that was one of the main problems that they um they had been so holding onto that for so long and it is so strong they do not want to let go of and then then their problem was usually that they would drink a lot and 

Recording: (4801/ 9621) 
i had enough friends who said to me can you make money with computers and i said yeah you can make funny with computers and they said what could i make funny with computers 

Recording: (4802/ 9621)

Recording: (4877/ 9621) 
i know 

Recording: (4878/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4879/ 9621) 
some of the really hard questions um why are bad things happening to good people people can not people can not just accept that that bad things happening to good people they want to know why i do not i mean yeah i have a personal relationship with my with my god but we are not on you know we are not on a conversation you know i am on the side of the table you are on the that is at the table why did this happen he he does not see fit to tell me why something happens unless it pertains to me um see it was another really hard one umis the is um apologetic uh for apologetic which is going out and saying your sender except price everybody on this campus has heard of brother jet he runs around on he runs around on the other side of the you know flat horror in y idea y idea yota and that is just you know i mean there are a lot of there are a lot of people within the community of of christians who can not stand that and we do not like what he is doing because yeah i am one of them because we have to go back anyone who has been influenced by him we have to go back to the back to him to undue all the damage he is done before we can really start in on them and and and helping them to understand what we are trying to tell them we have to undo what brother jetet has done because he is just i mean yeah maybe his heart is in the right place but he is doing it the wrong way but uh one of the big things is right after you are done doing all of theiel about you know why you think they should accept christ in their life they say okay that is good for you and that is the general that is the general feeling among people our age our generation i mean which generation or i mean anyways i am i am twenty i am twenty so there is like the generation x they are the generation right after me and then there is generation y two k they are generation right before me so we are stuck right in the middle i do not even think we have generation 

Recording: (4880/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (4881/ 9621) 
yeah so that it is on allentangy down there north of there 

Recording: (4882/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4883/ 9621) 
right down 

Recording: (4884/ 9621) 
where i do not think that there is any question they could look right down our throats because and anyway we fair a a couple of times from there they have started laying back at us and down it is good to me 

Recording: (4885/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4886/ 9621) 
i think that influences how everybody behave not only the kids the adults too 

Recording: (4887/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4888/ 9621) 
yeah he is like that um 

Recording: (4889/ 9621) 
yeah i would be at least thirty maybe like getting up forty forty before i have the experience really necessary to get in a good job but i do not want to be i mean like my uh mentioned crew advisors is thirty eight and retired i mean i i am going more for there  

Recording: (4890/ 9621) 
because they like it they like going that is the way they came to college football was secondary 

Recording: (4891/ 9621) 
uh well the problem is is uh like say every airline wants to go to new york city and they want all their businessmen there at a m well an airport has so many runways and so many tax you ways and you know like say ten airplanes every ten minutes can come in and out of those airport well they end up shooting like thirty there so instead of letting them all get in the air and stay up there on hold while they are you know shooting them in what they do is they like uh say going to a hair they will you have to call for release times to these different airport and they will say well he can not go right now but he can go like it twenty seven pasts they are so he they know by looking at the entire picture of how many airplanes are coming to that airport when he will fit in so it is not so much air traffic delays it is airlines that cause it to himself it is like uh you know like you and i and five hundred people want to get to this room uh ten oclock today well rather than say why do not some of you come at ten and another group come at ten fifteen and another group is then we are all trying to do the same thing at once and it does not work you know you you can not get you can not only get so many people through that door and if you say well i am going to take five at a time well they can get in but if you say i am taking five hundred at a time it does not work and so the airplane airlines always go well it is the government in regulations and blah blah blah that is why we are delayed and it is really them themselves because they are 

Recording: (4892/ 9621) 
i mean you talk to people in the catholic church about the unseen meaning the spiritual around and they freak out 

Recording: (4893/ 9621) 
um well if you have that bottle that four he will wake maybe up around six or seven i normally wake up at six anyways so it does not matter so i am ready for it and then 

Recording: (4894/ 9621) 
have to go to bed so really 

Recording: (4895/ 9621) 
jies of cowboy and he was an indian 

Recording: (4896/ 9621) 
fortunately we were out we were in in the country so we did not notice it we had 

Recording: (4897/ 9621) 
it was not so much of a hate thing it was just more these are the people i like to hang out with if you do not like that it is fine 

Recording: (4898/ 9621) 
i i do 

Recording: (4899/ 9621) 
oh really 

Recording: (4900/ 9621) 
to make me healthy or whatever because i vote again really healthy 

Recording: (4901/ 9621) 
well i am not adopting that well and fortunately the judge of our game is not listening to our conversation so i feel kind of speak  a mutual friend uh much better friend of mine than hers but she is more attracted than i am so we figured it all balanced out  we decided that made him on by us 

Recording: (4902/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4903/ 9621) 
i do not really go over to the east side very uh very often you know sometimes we would go over you know to high school drive and they would be in the opera you know or something like that but um i do not i do not know as far as i do not really keep up with the statistics as far as the crime rate and those types of things i mean i do not know if it is the media that you know kind of portrays us there is more than there used to be uh i know that when i was younger i was allowed to to do a lot more things uh by myself like to to go places on the bus and and those types of things than than my family is allowed to do now 

Recording: (4904/ 9621) 
i do not know yeah so it is kind of like i am for education in schools but um just like the bad things about it you know sex can do you can get pregnant number one 

Recording: (4905/ 9621) 
personally 

Recording: (4906/ 9621) 
really oh my god and then you can half market them if you want to we did not but you could  and we had two people who who um said you are kidding and they said never mind i am sorry because i never even thought that and i was like wow somebody must have done this before because everybody else is just like there is no other response but 

Recording: (4907/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (4908/ 9621) 
uh well i am very much my my base line philosophy is though shall not kill and that goes really a long ways for me that includes uh being a vegetarian and uh uhi would have said no let us not do this yet although on the other hand i i have to admit that their husband is some stuff that we have not been able to stop without it uh and and that is too bad you know that things are have been that bad in some like oh world war two i mean we did not really have any choice there not that some of the some of our wars have been in this area and uh so but you know you can get you can get a philosophy but it does not always apply every single case you know what i mean i am against capital punishment the the guy that they uh uh executed here in ohio last fall did you know about it you 

Recording: (4909/ 9621) 
that is that is what i would i would think in that case i mean i mean because the dominant culture i i mean is always going to be accessible to them 

Recording: (4910/ 9621) 
yeah but if you were the first state needing to do it it it it will cost you millions and millions and it would be rough it would be so hard to 

Recording: (4911/ 9621) 
you have uh they uh they if they had somebody in the eye i do not see it going to hurt him but you know most 

Recording: (4912/ 9621) 
for everybody so you you want to go to ivy league you do not even want to look here 

Recording: (4913/ 9621) 
it almost would be better if they let the dog go over because you know she is going to bring it mud and grass and it is not going to be perfect maybe knock something over you know kind of start with her but you have to go home you know what i mean 

Recording: (4914/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (4915/ 9621) 
but i do not know 

Recording: (4916/ 9621) 
um not really he i mean he obviously i went to church too for at least a few years uh while they are my parents are still together but i mean since then i mean there is really nothing about it 

Recording: (4917/ 9621) 
yeah it is a change of pace plus being around my sister instead of you know taking the twenty mile lead all the way up there just go a couple of blocks over and there she is 

Recording: (4918/ 9621) 
really what did he tell you 

Recording: (4919/ 9621) 
and uh so basically they decided to build a new buildingn to the church packed on and we they asked the choir for input 

Recording: (4920/ 9621) 
no it was put on it was more black than white teachers or it might have been even but now it is more black than white definitely now because i i live in the neighborhood where it is per not it is mostly black then white and that is where i have always lived my whole life 

Recording: (4921/ 9621) 
it is like it is like there is fires and stuff that you see or whatever and um and you get directions to it and it will be in a you know there is a a bunch of different places it will be in you know like a sports arena or something or or it depends how big they are i mean there is ones where there is like two hundred people this one is uh like five this one is for the thousand there is ones where they are like three thousand and uh this one is in canada that i did not i did not go to one but some of my friends went to it where there is like fifteen thousand people there or something like that 

Recording: (4922/ 9621) 
and they do everything they possibly can to make me happy and it is like um my my oldest girl she we are expecting our first grandchild here within a couple of weeks and she and i see each other all the time my daughter who goes to home chose to live at home because she just said it was just a better situation for her and um it is not that these girls are not independent and can not do it on their their megan could my second dog could have lived on her room from the time she was twelve i mean she is just very very mature very driven the only problem she has she did not have a job to supporting herself other than that she could have taken care of herself but she chooses to be still at home and be a part of our life and um my son he is both those kids have four points i mean they are really worth garden school because they know it is important and my son was uh he was the only only one that was in seventh and eighth grade he took that time to do the matureing that most of his friends are doing at sixteen and so i am really lucky that we had our difficulty at that point and uh and it was minimal but to me having been used to everything being perfect you know it was like it was like for him to have um 

Recording: (4923/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (4924/ 9621) 
friends uhhuh yeah 

Recording: (4925/ 9621) 
and um and then i my family we just went and fell we kind of lived up there 

Recording: (4926/ 9621) 
yeah dayloots there is there is only so much town so what dayloots and 

Recording: (4927/ 9621) 
which for the purpose of these book i suppose 

Recording: (4928/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (4929/ 9621) 
and it i was crying the whole time just that little pain my mom was laughing at me it was not funny  and and to what they left out parts you know if you talk to people when they have babies and they oh it is the worst pain but you will forget about it they left that that whole part where they put the up and throwin use and you you 

Recording: (4930/ 9621) 
oh yeah but he has to still support the unions huh yeah that is that is a rough place to be in but uh does the union like when people are going strike is the union helps support the people that are not getting paid on or 

Recording: (4931/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4932/ 9621) 
right uh yeah 

Recording: (4933/ 9621) 
oh right 

Recording: (4934/ 9621) 
and then when you do not take it easy 

Recording: (4935/ 9621) 
very big differences stuck together on a small ship they just glassed over those and it became just like the next generation except for they did not talk to the federation as much anymore so i did not like that one so much but 

Recording: (4936/ 9621) 
he is an our an article engineer um he started off here in columbus again actually they went out of business then he went to a band uh for quite zero space and um they ended up merging and now there is really no airos base things in columbus ohio so he is working for them in plain city which is um uh kind of heating and cooling air conditioning systems and so he is using his air phone to sign 

Recording: (4937/ 9621)

uh invite to come down and be saved 

Recording: (4939/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4940/ 9621) 
some of them are not uh there is quite a few of them that have adjusted well to society uh when they came home biggest thing i think when uh what what happened is there was not any joy about uh like world war two in create that you know it was like he came off and got the plane and you know they really care and you know 

Recording: (4941/ 9621) 
that is a rule coming down hand down 

Recording: (4942/ 9621)

Recording: (4946/ 9621)

Recording: (4956/ 9621) 
because i would have got my assweb 

Recording: (4957/ 9621) 
it is a lot of money 

Recording: (4958/ 9621) 
nobody ever you know what they wanted me to do was just put them on the real uh and i did not like them on the riddle i did not like what it did to them 

Recording: (4959/ 9621) 
right and just going over it and over it and over it 

Recording: (4960/ 9621) 
but uh the first opportunity to is our uh getting in demands is a better way at that name said well it should get the hell out of here 

Recording: (4961/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4962/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4963/ 9621) 
no i do not 

Recording: (4964/ 9621) 
it was it was especially it was my job but you know the parents always get stuck 

Recording: (4965/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4966/ 9621) 
and that is not a lot 

Recording: (4967/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4968/ 9621) 
i am sure you played well 

Recording: (4969/ 9621) 
it was like uh give them a license to be a screw up you know uh a lot of the nurses even who are former addict you know when it came down to doing procedure and doing business the way it should be done they were not doing phone pro to call and of course me i would be the one saying hey you are not phone pro to call and they would say well you know i am i am a former addict i am allowed to do that 

Recording: (4970/ 9621) 
it is just a challenge to figure out how to make something work or how to i i am just incredibly optimistic i mean i really feel like um whatever happens to me i really it is it is my responsibility to you know help it happen take care of it deal with it you know i always have a back up plan 

Recording: (4971/ 9621) 
boy 

Recording: (4972/ 9621) 
so you know down there there is five different sector so they split the uh area up into five different areas and uh you know there are some sector down there that get extremely busy and then sometimes it is just like you know your twirling or thumb it it is like useder from it is not like steady like if you are working at wire running the cash register it is just kind of like steady it is like you look at you know just it would be like sitting at my yard and there is no one in your line and then you turn your back and turn back around and there is like seventy five 

Recording: (4973/ 9621) 
i mean you know i have little thoughts of like i like to design um i mean a designers but you know like i went to uh uh i was in police uh uh law enforcement 

Recording: (4974/ 9621) 
i found from the east coast and i 

Recording: (4975/ 9621) 
and the people that would be decent parent are not because of the situations and whatnot um just my my my sister does not have kids i do not have kids we are in her mid late thirties um our friend is just had one um i do have some friends that have like more than one which is great because they are just great parents i know those kids are going to be going in but then i have uh other people that like my other friends that just had one we are trying to help uh a child in children services that came from poor 

Recording: (4976/ 9621) 
yeah they gave us nine dollars a day like nine twenty five for what meal plan i was on so then um we bought like pop starts and that lasted it for like a week of breakfast 

Recording: (4977/ 9621) 
stop yeah those are real chemicals 

Recording: (4978/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (4979/ 9621) 
so this is my first one like only doggy  so 

Recording: (4980/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4981/ 9621) 
um well the opinion kind of like the general consensus around upper arlington is that oh see there is not a good enough school 

Recording: (4982/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4983/ 9621) 
this is there is no faulting in it this folks but still there is nothing else to do and there is nothing creative response to say that experience so you end up with your getting again and again and you had two individuals you said you are getting and then immediately falling you know never mind a pretend they never said that 

Recording: (4984/ 9621) 
sure 

Recording: (4985/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4986/ 9621) 
yeah there were there were both there there were um whites skin heads at our school you know that were races against me for hanging around black people um i did not really have uh i guess uh there i am sure there was black people that were races too but i did not you know not in school i did not have problems really 

Recording: (4987/ 9621) 
yeah i actually have a bunch of numbers here that i hope i did not lose yeah i got uh three people to call see about jobs there should be in within middle of the week and it could gas money i could do construction cooking actually took columbus public schools cooking test and passed it so i am  technically a cook  

Recording: (4988/ 9621) 
right but how old is your kid 

Recording: (4989/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (4990/ 9621) 
uh neither one of them is married or have kids uh my sister does have boy friends for probably like three years or so and they always talk about them like marriage and kids and stuff like that with them 

Recording: (4991/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (4992/ 9621) 
that is cool 

Recording: (4993/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (4994/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4995/ 9621) 
like management here 

Recording: (4996/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (4997/ 9621) 
hum how would you up in ohio 

Recording: (4998/ 9621) 
the food service and she knows that they are really bad and that is really sad but uh they are not doing anything about it 

Recording: (4999/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (5000/ 9621) 
right right well it is sort of a problem as well but you know those i mean i it seems you know from what i have read if you want it to make a bomb it is fairly uncomfortableicated you know so 

Recording: (5001/ 9621) 
that is right and in other words it is so much me anymore instead of us and we 

Recording: (5002/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5003/ 9621) 
yeah it does not it is not like a skilled profession to me i 

Recording: (5004/ 9621) 
but see that is because i do not think americans travel as much as as like that the europeans do i think i guess because europeans they have like more i guess public transportation accessible they get the trains that the air will trains and the buses and and and and just that the first just by personal car you can go you know across just going across the border you can then go visit to like you know countries like like it so if andense but here it is like we have got our ozians and it is like we have got a like fly so i i guess that is why i like i think europeans i am a much more cooler in that respect they they are much more cosmopolitan just because they they they it is like it is no big deal for them for like somebody and you have to speak like seven languages i hear it is like you know you get somebody over here they used to connect actually who actually does english  you know it is like so that that is i think that is i think that is what i will find hopefully hopefully 

Recording: (5005/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5006/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5007/ 9621) 
yeah i think it is further east and where i went i was right in the year old mountains so it is like the border of europe and isia 

Recording: (5008/ 9621) 
so they are close but i try to avoid seeing them except my grandfather who is uh a nice terribly and what have been the others are all nice and sweet and stuff but do not have enough of worth in characteristics to me people have been lost in time 

Recording: (5009/ 9621) 
 it is and it was world war two that brought them together  um my my dad was uh in the at the end of the war he was an army air airport and he never had to go overseas but he was stationed in louisiana 

Recording: (5010/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5011/ 9621) 
not so much old star trek uh i like deep space nine of the new ones um i mean i back when it was new i liked the next generation but once deep space nine came out and had a gr toer darker story that was not so cookie cutter in fashion there was uh a greater degree of continuity from episode to episode and more character development it was not like these perfect people on the ship going and facing that the the characters themselves had flaws and that caused for better drama so i like that do not like voyager so much i i see that it when it first came out i had high hopes because i saw it as something that would be even grittyier they they had the potential for for excellent character conflict but they glossed over all those immediately within the first season uh and that really bothered me and then it ultimately the story you know they are trapped but they do not really pursue like the issues of being separated from home in two factions that had 

Recording: (5012/ 9621) 
they settled in springfield ohio and then my mom met my father um he was from potasco they met here at always she was there going to college and they settled here in columbus 

Recording: (5013/ 9621)

Recording: (5016/ 9621) 
and you hang out like i do not know it is more of like a like a suburban town as opposed to like a centralized downtown yeah it is just like you know like a half an hour i i i twenty minutes outside and you know you can get to double on or fifteen minutes double or something like that and i mean that is still like a part of of columbus as opposed toyeah 

Recording: (5017/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5018/ 9621) 
yeah they have uh book okay they do have sales tax but it is added into the price before see i have seen it they are trying to figure out what it is 

Recording: (5019/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (5020/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5021/ 9621) 
right and you know all the babies in the hospital become under my son is insurance and she is covered under her father is insurance so their medical expenses are not going to be very big 

Recording: (5022/ 9621) 
yeah you go to you go to class one building and you go across the yard to another and then you get another line and then you come across another you know locker and all that stuff just like a mini campus 

Recording: (5023/ 9621)

Recording: (5026/ 9621) 
and it is a very it seems to be a fairly conservative uh university as well so 

Recording: (5027/ 9621) 
i mean not that i i do not want to be on welfare it is like it is like it it down when i want to go up you know 

Recording: (5028/ 9621) 
uh actually when i was at a house state i worked for the newspaper 

Recording: (5029/ 9621) 
oh gee that is to me  

Recording: (5030/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5031/ 9621)

Recording: (5032/ 9621) 
um it is probably a bit worse i mean actually just waiting for my last experiment they are a couple of people talking about it they were talking about it 

Recording: (5033/ 9621) 
not this job no 

Recording: (5034/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5035/ 9621) 
right they and that is it they have not had a challenge you need to have a challenge just put to you every day every day because they have more meaningfulness and all so that what you put your head down the night is in your uh thank of what i did uh my god i am still coming to you i need more help at the mall because with out with something intangible there is going to be a motivation factor some of the guy give you the drill and they get up to mar more and more and they say hey i am going to do a better job today than it yesterday but when we as a society say oh gee he struggles i guess they say well let us lower this thing let us lower the bar a little more let us you know gosh start a  scooney he did not make that last shot last night and they came out let us get sconey two more minutes then he went and listened and let us hold he gets too way of men is trying to shoot he gets too way men and she is trying to shoot he gets too way men and then she is trying to shoot he gets and she is too way men and i am gonna shoot 

Recording: (5036/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5037/ 9621) 
i do not know uh in i do not and for awhile we got it stopped the thing that is uh confusing to me is that sometimes we will get something stopped for twenty five or thirty years or ten or fifteen and then we go back it is like hey we have got moved ourselves solid out why are we going back to it now uh and and i think you know that papers keep saying that our uh crime rate is going down and everything and so uh i think that is because we some people are you know trying to make it deal with these people as people who are ill or sick and try to help them with their you know it took us a long time to figure out that alcoholism is not the disease okay and it is so now we try to help alcoholics well uh certainly murderings  

Recording: (5038/ 9621) 
no this all started long before that actually just recently he seems to have accepted the idea that guess the baby is going to be born right i think he just kind of tried to ignore for a long time time but he is off of your hobbies now uh and she is she is great

Recording: (5068/ 9621) 
umhum and the wrong atmosphere they was this was not the right time and uh it just i had money you know i i had i got like uh a settlement like thirty thousand dollars not a settlement but when i sold my stocks and everything i got like thirty seven thousand dollars and put about five thousand here five thousand there i still had twenty you know started the business and money was coming in and uh used the money for the using the money for other things and not realizing that they supposed to be putting that money back in the business you know by us running around with a bunch of other people at basically we are doing the same thing you know so 

Recording: (5069/ 9621)

and basically they were three weeks long they were about four and a half hours the first one was really long you know james man i could not think that  last night was not so bad though i mean the first one was the light of lot of information classroom kind of stuff but he knew they would sit there and they were not breathing and they were kind of rolling their eyes and they just big cutty bunch above to you know it is going to come down to it you know and and you can be so awful and he is just real supportive and and just he is just trying  it makes it is a it makes it better 

Recording: (5074/ 9621)

yeah i she was like a a community lea is on uh with our corporation so i was a supervisor on my job and sometimes i have a very very difficult uh client that i needed advice from her on how to you know go about working with them and uh she i would call her in she would uh it would just be really rude and un healthful 

Recording: (5081/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (5082/ 9621) 
yeah it is and it seems to me that they do not keep the very very best of the kids in state but it gets a lot of uh like just below the absolute best in it keeps a lot of them here 

Recording: (5083/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5084/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5085/ 9621) 
yeah they they 

Recording: (5086/ 9621) 
yeah i have two older brothers one is ten years older the other one is fifteen years older 

Recording: (5087/ 9621) 
yeah we met um at where we there is a singlesgord where we called work it is on twelve avenue down here and it is just where all the single people under thirty go to church and there is dances and different activities and 

Recording: (5088/ 9621) 
um i am signed up for art protection right now which i like art protection but i think there is probably more time into it than i am ready to actually commit into it 

Recording: (5089/ 9621) 
yeah uh i like baseball but i used to like that a lot better when i was younger but now i do not i would not take the time to set and watch that whole baseball game on the tv 

Recording: (5090/ 9621) 
hm 

Recording: (5091/ 9621) 
i mean my oh my sister said if you did not leave him i was going to stay up with your head to the wall  i do not even hope but she was not kidding though because you know it is just one of the oh i can help him you know i have learned on the caretaker i i roll my eyes because it is like you can not change people that much do you think but um it is weird because it was terrible black because he was real controlling and you know you start to doubt yourself like did i say that right and like he would not let me sleep so then you start to lose that you know what i mean really you really do start to lose your money 

Recording: (5092/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5093/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5094/ 9621) 
i know i am i can not wait because i the house we live in at the half double when we had a front porch and a deck which i really decked out but you know i have like eighty plants in my house now but i just can not wait to have my own space so i never plant anything in the ground there because of that well i am going to leave you know and 

Recording: (5095/ 9621) 
 this one day 

Recording: (5096/ 9621) 
and it never goes back to the way it was before did you just know that there is someone that is completely dependent on you for everything 

Recording: (5097/ 9621) 
right if she could have become the candidate she might have been able to beat i i think almost anybody can beat gore right now but you know in in election times a weekend is a couple of centuries uh a year is an eon you know so anything that happened between now and then but i think a door had a good chance of being elected because most americans are moderate will go with the moderate candidate uh which is basically where clinton placed himself in the two elections he ran in uh most real democrats the warren beaties of the world many you know congressmen and and senators just like clinton because they they did not think he was democratic enough uh i like clinton because as i said over the years i have learned that extremes in either party do not get elected and that if you want someone that has your general interest at heart you have to find someone who is a moderate and can appeal to everybody i used to tell them how to to put together a school every campaign that basically you had the rule of thirties and that had nothing to do with my age but that there was about thirty percent of the people who were who are for you with the yes votes thirty percent who are automatically against you the no votes and thirty percent in between i told them at northern no votes and you know just just do not get them upset with you you do not want them you know working actively against you lock up your your thirty that are with you and make sure that you know you do something with them but this group the the middle thirty is i called them you you had amazogdo and that is what clinton did so well and that is what dole could have done i am not sure if george w is going to be able to uh because to get the the nomination eventually he is going to come out and have to make his hard statements to those people which is i am antiabortion i am pro gun he is already said the progun and that is going against what most americans are saying door i think represented where most americans are if you look at opinion polls uh so you know you have to find a way to to moderate that stance uh whether you are a republican or a democrat 

Recording: (5098/ 9621) 
yeah if i had um if i had stayed for the i i did not graduate so if i would stayed for the fourth year uh when we did a lot we would do a lot of um uh uh making up a poor fully of that kind of thing uh i probably then i would have started going to interviews and i i would have i probably would have stayed but it was 

Recording: (5099/ 9621) 
so they can just talk norm on it will not be too loud because they talk loud 

Recording: (5100/ 9621) 
hm 

Recording: (5101/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (5102/ 9621) 
uhhuh uhhuh 

Recording: (5103/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5104/ 9621) 
 so and he 

Recording: (5105/ 9621) 
that is how i would like them to be 

Recording: (5106/ 9621) 
there did not used to be any especially in restaurants and everything and now it is such a open market and they know that they have to accommodate every um body is taste you know i mean before now i would have to go into restaurant and to salad and bake potato you know i mean there was nothing really nothing unless i go to a buffet and then all the food to cook down i mean honestly you know it is like no rectangular value 

Recording: (5107/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5108/ 9621) 
uh i know like i know one of the poisons using it is like rap poison or something like that and they mean just obviously they had to have putting rap poison into you when it is meant to kill the rat obviously it seems pretty dangerous 

Recording: (5109/ 9621) 
all right very good  

Recording: (5110/ 9621) 
he has different levels of things that people need at different age and things like that and you know and and at forty you you think wow you know and you really need to make a difference or do something and and i can see that because i have gone through all the phase that he is talking about so 

Recording: (5111/ 9621) 
jimmy say a few words for a past thirty he is saying let me think get out of here 

Recording: (5112/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (5113/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (5114/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5115/ 9621) 
we like to i do i like to cook i enjoy cooking 

Recording: (5116/ 9621) 
you know what are you going to do you hit that kid you are going to jail 

Recording: (5117/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5118/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5119/ 9621) 
yeah i think the population uh in a way but i think it also leaves it open for all the things of having too many people in one area uh i do not i do not know i think the main thing that affects me now and since i have been home i have been reading the paper a lot more and you know more aware of what is going on and i really uh i am to be some kind of red for uh i do not know a lot of the places that are coming up the gentleman is clubs and things like that i just i think that is going to be really bad for the kids and and everybody around uh there is one off of uh bathel i do not know itself of henderson tooth and then there is the red hot peppers or something i saw the other day and i could not even believe they are like right across the street from each other you know and it is funny because you read the paper and and it seems like so many people are concerned about kids and education and all that but then they let all that stuff so i think it really affects it yeah try to go around  and until they make a woman is club so they will not be real equal  

Recording: (5120/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (5121/ 9621) 
but they are uh because they are both government programs but yeah but i think like i said for the for the younger people because it is because it is not their fault their parents can not get health health care so  

Recording: (5122/ 9621) 
no it happened quite a few times and that i mean i also did it on him too you know we both did it but um it once i had my son 

Recording: (5123/ 9621) 
so you have how many kids 

Recording: (5124/ 9621) 
uh we have been very happy with the o s e day care i do not know if you have any as they are using with but oh it is it is just unbelievable our daughter went there her from six weeks all the way up to when she went to first grade and uh i mean once she got out of that day care she could read she could write she could do computer you know you know it is an education it is not you know people you pay for it it is one of your hires but you know higher amount of money for 

Recording: (5125/ 9621) 
once you are in it you have been in it and that is it i have thirty two points 

Recording: (5126/ 9621) 
yeah it you are right 

Recording: (5127/ 9621) 
that is all right okay 

Recording: (5128/ 9621) 
it felt innocent to me and i like that uh because all the other times where they started to kiss it is always been like stereoty to romantic and that is like wow two friends alone it is new years perfect you know it was not it was not like they were going to jump in the sack or anything like that 

Recording: (5129/ 9621) 
 yeah really i do not know i mean i guess for me i i just i just in prison i get along so well you know and and we have been together for about two years and i mean i i do not know i just i do i just i just really like them i do not go to the same types of opinions now in ten years from now but it certainly there is a lot of things that that our families are very similar i mean we have a lot of the same types of opinions about about different things and and we communicate very well and i think those are a lot of things you have to look at from the beginning i know that i was in a relationship for about five years before i met him and um his name was an station too but he he drives a lot 

Recording: (5130/ 9621) 
yeah that is true 

Recording: (5131/ 9621) 
oh really  that is cute  

Recording: (5132/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5133/ 9621) 
i got a lot of respect with college kids majority of them it is it is other people do not have respect for 

Recording: (5134/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (5135/ 9621) 
and oh she is poor i think she is bringing it back off you know it is like 

Recording: (5136/ 9621) 
oh no and they turned out it was the the uh the faceless aliens set a trap for the for the guys and i did not like the way it was resolved but i liked the fact that it was not results the way that they set it up so i think that i mean we supposedly know about samantha uh 

Recording: (5137/ 9621) 
it is not it is not because i i see where he is and he is really messed up and i i can not do anything for him but i have you know i i am open to a relationship with them 

Recording: (5138/ 9621) 
uhhuh  

Recording: (5139/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5140/ 9621) 
 oh my you like oh my gosh  

Recording: (5141/ 9621) 
well the reason i asked was a lot it seems to me a lot of the in particular going to church or going back to church for people is when their kid gets old enough to go to sunday school  starting asking questions about religion and you are saying well i suppose i get answer all these but  yeah 

Recording: (5142/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (5143/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5144/ 9621) 
well and i think it really it still goes back to the mom and the dad and and what the kid things would make their mom and dad happy you know would i act this way would that make my mom and because until you are about five or four your parents are pretty important to you and what they think so that is when you know you have to instill that stuff you have to you know oh and they learned by watching you do it too i mean my son now i so i am one let us see he is run he was fifteen maybe he had run across the street one month of the eighty six door lead across the street was trying to bring her garbage down he would seen me do that he go oh let me get that for you martha she is got rs writers she looks like she is going to fall she takes steps about this big and i have seen him do that 

Recording: (5145/ 9621) 
you know was limited money and i live in a nice neighborhood i have lived there for eleven years i have never had any trouble whatsoever and uh the buses right there and you know the only thing that bothers me is if i want to you know go to grocery store i have got to go you know over to high street you know to clintonville you know to the big bear 

Recording: (5146/ 9621) 
yeah you all still do not have our house like when we were kids i mean you would meet we would get in a fight and then after that we have asked friends now you know i would be walking down the street and have them fourteen year old scaring me to death right now 

Recording: (5147/ 9621) 
uh before we used to have a system that only people in the back room of the library is connected to and it was all mainframe and then people got pcs on their desk and suddenly the whole world of their access any system in what they could do on their desk changed uh and now we have gone more out into the public look in the public see and do it it is not just for the people in the back room uh and then the way uh you know people in the back room uh and then the way i you know people you put anybody anywhere at connect we only worked with library is before and now we are trying to figure out how do we deal with anybody who just wants to connect to us 

Recording: (5148/ 9621) 
i do not know i mean i was actually looking at that red her military and they started popping up all this abuse stuff and i was like man darn it so  right my 

Recording: (5149/ 9621) 
yeah over the years we have had situations like that you know of pregnancy here and there and things that people needed to get worked out or some of them being worried about uh uh uh neighbor being abused the child being abused and not knowing what to do with it about it so yeah but you know i it is i am just lucky i am so lucky 

Recording: (5150/ 9621) 
well those has spend you 

Recording: (5151/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5152/ 9621) 
 i started at the real bottom of it  

Recording: (5153/ 9621) 
yeah i gave them to my sister and my mom and stuff like that so 

Recording: (5154/ 9621) 
yeah it is uh i had a little give and give me a minute

Recording: (5157/ 9621) 
and she did but we were out 

Recording: (5158/ 9621) 
um air space industry my dad uh had a degree in uh engineering uh oh what kind of engineering drafting engineering i think and um worked for in california and they asked him to move to the north american plant here in columbus out near the airport when it was north american before it became rockwell and uh that is why we moved here and that is why i grew up on the side because it was close to there  and uh and when i was one year old we took a car trip across the country  so i do not remember much of it but  that is how we moved  

Recording: (5159/ 9621)

Recording: (5167/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (5168/ 9621)

all right 

Recording: (5177/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5178/ 9621)

Recording: (5179/ 9621) 
well we believe that uh that regulation that was there on the earth was actually restored again in through joe smith because he had is his iron is hard to know what was true and he prayed and he actually had a vision where he saw god in jeez christ and i know this is all really i mean this is like deep doctor and stuff but and um and he was told that there were not none of the churches on the earth were true that and some of them had good things but they they are um they were not exactly hitting the mark 

Recording: (5180/ 9621) 
i i 

Recording: (5181/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (5182/ 9621) 
oh the daughter is already taking golf lessons

Recording: (5184/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5185/ 9621) 
yeah i guess i just have the nerve to scratch and stuff like my ring is all twist up because they bother me like i do not wear this all the time  it is one of the days i made 

Recording: (5186/ 9621) 
you know every time you ask the questions like it is been stripped it is over and over and um he does not seem like he is real brave 

Recording: (5187/ 9621) 
and uh 

Recording: (5188/ 9621) 
i do he does 

Recording: (5189/ 9621) 
i know uh 

Recording: (5190/ 9621) 
um yeah that is what they suggest doing is two years of medical get a phd and then do last years of medical 

Recording: (5191/ 9621) 
so we walked across the street to the church 

Recording: (5192/ 9621) 
the above it and periodically they would have to clean those out because uh the fan would throw in other distance of fumes they would throw some limt off of this uh so he was up on top of one of these rollers cleaning up the hood and with supposedly nonsmamable solvement 

Recording: (5193/ 9621) 
i i well that is a that is fake you know uh and i never ever really thought about when i was growing up as it was what was around and everything i always knew that by i their again you know by my dad being a hunter and everything you know i knew that when you shot something that that died it was not it was not a game you know uh and i would hate to think that that would cost some kid to go off the rock around and shoot somebody you know seems she does not know you have been i mean that does not i do not even know why they should be any concern for her i guess on the same 

Recording: (5194/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5195/ 9621) 
you know i do not think that women should be on the front lines uh some women are physically able to do but you need it some definitely are not of course there is uh same but it same token to okay and some men are not but uh they they supportso it is it is support goopes i think that is all right 

Recording: (5196/ 9621) 
yeah i mean he 

Recording: (5197/ 9621) 
she is very bright she is very she comes from an extremely dysfunctional family her uh parents divorce and she is about four her mother is in alcohol like her father said that he would take her with him and then after he got divorced they changed his mind so she is pretty much raised herself it it is a big it it is a terrible thing as what she said to go through and she is made it very clear that she will not live with an alcoholic and that is helped straightening him out so and our feeling was never that the alcoholism or the the drugs was not the problem and we have dealt with several counselors and that is all they wanted to deal with our crime has always been at the system and took the psychologist a year and a half but he finally of course charley is he is very into his and even as a you are talking to him he could do this he he seemed to be able to give adults what they needed from him 

Recording: (5198/ 9621) 
that was real close to my home  

Recording: (5199/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5200/ 9621) 
but he would bring in nutrients list or whatever to explain to the parents blah blah blah 

Recording: (5201/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5202/ 9621) 
okay so they it seems like an independent contract over the 

Recording: (5203/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5204/ 9621) 
um i think i think through education that is it is just going to only help kids because a lot of times maybe they do not get that at home so they are really looking to choose the right thing to do 

Recording: (5205/ 9621) 
yeah oh my uh i am in this uh venturing crew which is their boy scouts our leader has this like society totally planned out 

Recording: (5206/ 9621) 
back then i was working at a cycle shop but i was in the service while i was working there 

Recording: (5207/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5208/ 9621) 
crime and stuff uh i mean a lot of it is just a strong economy now that we have started during the republican years in straight over uh but people have been better off financially overall uhso he is many he is major mistakes policy wise well if you say his personal life  just in his he is twelve yeah  

Recording: (5209/ 9621) 
i mean it goes back more towards a curious nature of kids where i mean i can not say there is anything really different 

Recording: (5210/ 9621) 
no that 

Recording: (5211/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5212/ 9621) 
i mean that is not to say that i do not like being catholic or whatever 

Recording: (5213/ 9621) 
uh it is just there we go again who is right and who is wrong i have no idea 

Recording: (5214/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5215/ 9621) 
but you had to you had to work you had to you had to migrant they they started supporting the family up by saying sir if you want a job we are expecting to los angeles we are so they split the family up 

Recording: (5216/ 9621) 
yeah i think so i think in high school there was well maybe that was for the pregnant girls that were in our high school  because there were pregnant girls in my high school 

Recording: (5217/ 9621) 
oh my goodness 

Recording: (5218/ 9621) 
yeah that is that is pretty much out there 

Recording: (5219/ 9621) 
um yeah give some charity and keep care of your bills and probably go on that vacation you have been dying for like you are making my brainwaters here over australia 

Recording: (5220/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5221/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (5222/ 9621) 
it is like a mail order catalog thing and um so uh uh people are really really incompetent it is really funny i mean if you some people um i do not know how they even some people who can not speak english even well enough i do not know how they got signed up or how they even have a credit card order i mean and too you can tell especially because people call from all over it is really funny to talk to people from alabama or south carolina i can never knew people from south carolina had such sick accidents i have never really thought of north carolina and south carolina being really southern even though i mean they seeded first you know but i mean uh i i just just that is different i always thought that more being east coast as opposed to southern and men there is people there who i just you can not even understand what they are saying and i i especially too how it is all like you have to give numbers and all numbers and stuff type it in real fast and people go unbelievablely fast when they say like a interesting number and then they get mad at you like you can not type it in fast enough like if they just said it slow once of it saves time and and um just how too how how three d eight a and a bunch of numbers all sound the same like d b three eight a also the same and um people you know you like a is in apple and they are like apple what are you talking about something like that it is something real weird and um just how they are like where is my membership number and they can not find it in in the you know and the like our i look on the catalog where it says m e m number that that that would be a membership number and people like oh all right but i do not know they i i really do not i really want to get a job that is like you know warehouse or something something real easy where i can just like load boxes or something because i never have time to really i mean like i trying to do like i i trying to to do go to the mall but it is like but we work two thirty to eleven so it is like by the time you get home it is like just going to sit and like not do anything and like um you know working out is hard and stuff because you know sometimes i want to have a job where if i do not have time at the end of the day to work out it is like i am working out sort of like as during my job and like i i really hate talking on the phone now like having jobs for why over i talking on the phone makes me just not want to talk on the phone at all at home where is usually like when i am on the phone at home like then it like brings weird flashbacks to work so it is like all of a sudden it is like talking like i am at work you know so it is like like i do not know if because the phone like 

Recording: (5223/ 9621) 
yeah my dad is a chevenous pig but  he still has  

Recording: (5224/ 9621) 
but disney is like is is like pretty much accessible because 

Recording: (5225/ 9621) 
yeah well i i asked the germans what the what stereotypes they like are prevalent in germany uh of americans and they said you know americans are cowboys and he donald is three meals a day 

Recording: (5226/ 9621) 
i do not want to tend to believe here so 

Recording: (5227/ 9621) 
but i imagine your similar has a a similar world view perhaps twisteded in some 

Recording: (5228/ 9621) 
because i mean i have got a lot i would love this man to death it is like and that might be something that was is holding me back from dating but you know it will eventually go away hopefully  but um yeah i think he looks like he is a very nice guy and you know he just does not not have to stick with one woman i do not think yeah 

Recording: (5229/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (5230/ 9621) 
how to uh step by step of how to commit suicide and yeah they have to be responsible i think because you know you put an idea into somebody is head and then when you give them the resources to carry these these things out i think it is it has to be responsible for a lot of it 

Recording: (5231/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5232/ 9621) 
and i think at some times they do not even count all the voteors i mean sometimes they really want it to go do bad enough even though the majority voted not for it i mean even though the majority voted so dead or they will you know uh 

Recording: (5233/ 9621) 
if you just look at the nature of what they are doing it is just 

Recording: (5234/ 9621) 
i do not know if they still do that was a long time ago but that is always kind of been known for that you know 

Recording: (5235/ 9621) 
the part now it takes about fifty minutes but to do all the stretching 

Recording: (5236/ 9621) 
right right 

Recording: (5237/ 9621) 
exactly 

Recording: (5238/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5239/ 9621) 
i was just listening to music and i got a little hijack from this uh tree across the way it got destroyed by lightning i looked across and it started raining and wind was a little heavy rock amy back and forth like this i got up all the way looked around and said what the hell is going on here turn on the radio and they said some uh you know thunderstorm coming through and it will be gone by twenty minutes or something and it struck me and it felt like it was going to tip over i just i got out of there real fast and uh started walking down towards it is about uh probably about a good twenty mile walk to where the nearest uh twenty four hour house of panhandle is have you ever been down there the eyeop 

Recording: (5240/ 9621) 
because i they feel they have the need for it there is so many golfers i mean that sports was i i mean when i my mom used to play growing up and they only let them on the golf course this one day a week which is amazing it is like on a tuesday and when i lived in florida a lot of the courses was like that too and i thought they are only allowed women one day a week you know it is not amazing there is so many good women golfers now and but they said they are too slow and they always talk and and that just kills me when my mom got the only day she could play and she wanted to play more 

Recording: (5241/ 9621) 
that is one of the things we looked when we were shopping for homes was the way we were shopping for school systems just as much you know so and i do not want to buy a house and i do not want to have to move them and make it get older to move into a better school system because uh because it seems like since we have bought our house the house is they are just double and in triple in the same value it is unbelievable and in value it is unbelievable yeah oh i do not know ours has increased quite a lot since we have been there but we have been there i guess about ten years oh we let run it in grand view 

Recording: (5242/ 9621) 
i have been in the same house for seventeen years 

Recording: (5243/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5244/ 9621) 
no i we actually have season tickets that people that went clear up and the seat back um but we enjoy it because we a lot of times we walk in 

Recording: (5245/ 9621) 
that that would be seriously fun but uh it depends if you work in the street you get money 

Recording: (5246/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (5247/ 9621) 
and uh the change in name is like a lot it is got robbs a lot more um because my grandfather cuts a shot gun in the neat counter but um um eastern um eastern is crazy um 

Recording: (5248/ 9621) 
yeah like like sort of i mean it was like mp threes and stuff and people do a lot of that but it is it is uh i do not know i do not i do not really go on it at all that much like i do not know 

Recording: (5249/ 9621)

Recording: (5250/ 9621) 
so i have not been able to eat that but luckily my husband he is allergic too 

Recording: (5251/ 9621) 
and i mean that is pretty i do not know extreme yeah uh so i mean it is definitely i would say that it is more serious drugs are definitely 

Recording: (5252/ 9621) 
living in columbus all my life uh my dad is dead eating there for about twenty five years my mom is still alive she is not in real good health and my wife moved from columbus to arizona and then she moved back here and we got married uh said i grew up here i used to hunt back to you know her henderson on the changing and about four hundred and i used to hunt all up and do that 

Recording: (5253/ 9621)

Recording: (5254/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5255/ 9621)

Recording: (5263/ 9621) 
i think it is been good i mean the economy has been very good uh it seems like society seems to be improving you know even when we talked about this 

Recording: (5264/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (5265/ 9621) 
okay so uh he got it dispelled from catholic school for behavior problems 

Recording: (5266/ 9621)

Recording: (5273/ 9621) 
you know she is works you know in a school building and she she hears all the troubles and 

Recording: (5274/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (5275/ 9621) 
yeah yeah and that is the thing about the schools too you know i i totally disagree with uniforms you know unless it is all slacks all of it because you get the the girls in the uniforms in their short and they can not enforce that they do not enforce that and the day that my daughter came home and told me that this one teacher put the whole the girls up in the front row i should have went and met him or i should have said hey you know here this is you know he does not met me in it and i really you know felt myself for that but it is made me more aware too and i you know when you look at somebody and say oh you would never dream that they well i do you know there is not anything i do not put past anybody doing i really do not because they just yeah no no i do because there is some good ones out there there are some bad ones too but you know 

Recording: (5276/ 9621) 
um three years 

Recording: (5277/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (5278/ 9621) 
oh yeah they should they cut up in the are pulling this baby out in this little hole of this lady is stomach and i just uh i had heart surgery when i was younger and so i would had lots of needles and those type of things and i would when it comes to needlesils and and that kind of stuff and just kind of squeamish about it you know so that stuff i just i just do not want to see it 

Recording: (5279/ 9621) 
but i mean i honestly do think i would at least go to church on occasion if it was not forced on me i mean it just got sort of just to the point of being ridiculous going seventeen eighteen years every single week 

Recording: (5280/ 9621) 
yeah i do not know like to the scary as tvs uh washers dryers uh like weird things too like i have seen on tv things too like i have seen on tv things too like i have seen on tv things too like i have seen on tv things too like i have seen on tv things too you know 

Recording: (5281/ 9621) 
uh how many i do not know it does not matter uh been in in many ones that were too hard for me 

Recording: (5282/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5283/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (5284/ 9621) 
baseball like i collected baseball cards i lived in detroit so that is why it like stuck with me so like i i remember i in my time was out in third grade like you are allowed to bring one item because like you are a little kid so i can make you feel better and i brought my detroit so i got a like i i own like i on the way of detroit or boston and boston just because i i uh was born there but and like people make fun of me they like you know because detroit is horrible they are in the last place 

Recording: (5285/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5286/ 9621) 
yeah probably have to get it double in there you know worthings and somewhere around there to find a couple million years but uh 

Recording: (5287/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (5288/ 9621) 
yeah i i think they are two faced 

Recording: (5289/ 9621) 
yeah you really did yeah 

Recording: (5290/ 9621) 
no no they take no they take the money whether you are in it or not you have no choice you have a choice of whether you are a member or not but they still take the money and if you cross the line they will take that money back so anybody that yeah you know you are better off getting another job if it lasts for a long time i did some of that  it is tough you know columbus has a big you know job market there is they have everywhere you look there is help on it so but it is tough to get a job where you can just walk in and start today or you know tell them hey you know the bit strikes over i am gone so that was kind of a tough looking for that type of job so oh yeah three weeks it pays it costs yeah it costs quite a bit of money but they got some straight pay in this and that but it was not a lot you know two hundred dollars a week is not much at all so and when you have a family and i mean two hundred dollars a week does not pay my day care bills though so it is going to be tight for our family for a few months you know to get back on 

Recording: (5291/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (5292/ 9621) 
and they stopped doing that now

Recording: (5314/ 9621) 
and it was it was fun i met a lot of neat people in fact that is where i met the woman who is child i took care of she was one of the artists who came to me and but it was not nobody was going to make any money on it and it was the kind of thing that it was a project they started it when my youngest started kindergarten because i needed a new project and i did not know anything about it i would never even been in a gallery i thought uh this will be fun i will just rent this space because i found this space and i was trying to think of something i could do with it so i so i will rent this space and then i will just put it down in the paper and i will find a bunch of artists and then all of that stuff business up so and it was consignmentments i did not need that that money i just needed rent and we had art classes and that was fun and so once i got that whole thing all set up and all ready to go it is not nearly as interesting once you know you i like i like to make it happen i am not really interested in just sitting there waiting for somebody to come in and so when the lease was up on high street i was going to get rid of it and a couple people came to me that were artists there and said could we please you know would you consider having some partners and i said sure if you have got they are willing to come and send those plays and i off the phone and said here so we moved to grand view and it was doing much better over there and uh then the same thing happened the attorneys he was next door to us decided they wanted our space and when our lease was out they had more money than we did so we were going to have to move again and i just said this is not worth it and besides that i was ready that was about three or four years into it i was ready to do something out and i had already started taking care ofesse then so i used to take him down to the gallery with me and i had a little bass in the back and people think something out

Recording: (5320/ 9621) 
get a pull if you have got the pull table over down in the hall i show you it is kind of  

Recording: (5321/ 9621)

Recording: (5330/ 9621) 
umhum that is good this 

Recording: (5331/ 9621) 
and they would have a hard time believing that  i mean if the person knew i think if the person knew that people were paying for them at charge and that was important to them and they prayed and 

Recording: (5332/ 9621) 
um i feel that the past season the past two seasons really have not been as strong as the earlier seasons and so in some ways i am you know i i i am not as upset about the actual files competing it is run as i have been about other shows i mean it is also the simpsons final season i have heard 

Recording: (5333/ 9621) 
i might be wrong because my answer would not be that good on that question though of the fast but you know what i mean that 

Recording: (5334/ 9621) 
um the things that i notice that are different i guess i mean if you look like as far as expansion obviously there is a lot of areas that that are developed now that did not used to be 

Recording: (5335/ 9621) 
i was very still down i am not you know i was not calling fact stuff no more and he still wanted to do that you know and light in sheet make up stories and and he still does it i do not and and i do not understand why after like he is a grown man if he was out do not make up a story and his mother also make you know they are just it just it is very stressful for me and and i that is another another reason why i do not want my son going there for you know much longer um but his dad pays pays her for the baby sitting because i can not afford it 

Recording: (5336/ 9621) 
yeah yeah and they will not want to go anywhere with you anyway so it is probably a pipe drive 

Recording: (5337/ 9621) 
umhum right 

Recording: (5338/ 9621) 
well i do not think he it invaderated but he uh he was selectiveable about the people on the 

Recording: (5339/ 9621) 
what and the first episode the first half was excellent had uh cigarette smoking man just it was from his perspective he was talking about and then the second half got like

Recording: (5342/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5343/ 9621)

Recording: (5386/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5387/ 9621) 
yeah i do not i hear some of that from gorb in that as much 

Recording: (5388/ 9621) 
it is a cartoon i believe it started out 

Recording: (5389/ 9621) 
oh it was there was a lot of discouraging things just i mean i learned so much it and it was not always just people reject it that was discouraging because that was kind of funny at times 

Recording: (5390/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (5391/ 9621) 
there were a couple that would go to raves every now and then and use it 

Recording: (5392/ 9621) 
against them in a lot of ways 

Recording: (5393/ 9621) 
of the times and memories and stuff 

Recording: (5394/ 9621) 
and that is where they oh high state players i do not know if you know they they stay there every night for a game i mean it is the most expensive because they are down for midnight all the players stay there but to my amazed they come down for a uh i think if you have a dinner then they come down for a midnight snack and so funny all these guys come down their shorts and stuff 

Recording: (5395/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5396/ 9621) 
but i think that is kind of nice 

Recording: (5397/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (5398/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5399/ 9621) 
raised eleven 

Recording: (5400/ 9621) 
 just like 

Recording: (5401/ 9621) 
about two two and a half years ago 

Recording: (5402/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (5403/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5404/ 9621) 
in a heartbeed trying to help them but they do not i do not even think they make an effort to like put out any you know 

Recording: (5405/ 9621) 
the majority of the ones that do not get the guides at home that you are trying to reaching on good a boy scale 

Recording: (5406/ 9621) 
they are they have a very nice standard of living all of them do 

Recording: (5407/ 9621) 
and so they offer to move them back 

Recording: (5408/ 9621) 
you know people like that can not work when i was a kid your family took care of you they was not poor from there and stuff like this but you do not have family structured no more 

Recording: (5409/ 9621) 
a parakeet yet little two and a half three ounce ball of fluff 

Recording: (5410/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5411/ 9621) 
just start running this camping  and then okay it is kind of read up on it but i have not but really 

Recording: (5412/ 9621) 
oh yeah and that is normal we understood that and we you know we knew a lot of stuff we we raised him to be very independent and i always said that we are going to be credit this someday and i said another ten years we will be pleased but uh we were not particularly raised either of us my wife or i to be very independent uh so i guess the point that when we were first married pretty it was hard to make a simple decision on anything you know we have worked through that after twenty five years but uh or to stand on our own on anything but you know we would learn to do it but we always he was did not want onions on anything he if he ordered a a happy meal without onions and they put onions on it he would go up to the counter even it is six and seven years old until i am 

Recording: (5413/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5414/ 9621) 
oh my gosh they just 

Recording: (5415/ 9621) 
nope i met him through a friend i met him who his brother was dating my best friend 

Recording: (5416/ 9621) 
yeah he is really good 

Recording: (5417/ 9621) 
i think it would 

Recording: (5418/ 9621) 
yeah and that is what i like 

Recording: (5419/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5420/ 9621) 
hit the mark sometimes though  he gets to clean the toilet especially since most of that is his 

Recording: (5421/ 9621) 
anything else is hard to fix it somewhere else anyway so if you know how to put an operating system on your machine you can start over you can start over there is no reason to be scared of anything that you do problem remember one thing playing with computers for most people is being afraid they are going to break something 

Recording: (5422/ 9621) 
well i believe me i know 

Recording: (5423/ 9621) 
yeah you can hide a lot of that and get away with it for a long time which you know i am sure she did i do not know i always thought um i always thought it would be neat to have uh system like the police have if you do not pay a speeding to get there is a warrant for your rest and they come after you 

Recording: (5424/ 9621) 
like uh oh from mormons well our basic uh real fundamental old beliefs that the church that uh russians believed in at one time was the true church and that it was um the the same church that craze set up when he was on the earth with the total possible and but after craze d died that the authority was taken from the earth to um have those apollo and to have the the church set up the like it was and it must have been really strong because it still lasted all the same catholic and or all the or sadbroct churches still carried all these beliefs 

Recording: (5425/ 9621) 
um no children so it was quite easy for us 

Recording: (5426/ 9621) 
yeah not not for special conditions nothing just universal it is wrong 

Recording: (5427/ 9621) 
oh i think it i would do it in a minute but my family does not want it they uh my husband thinks we are fine he does not want anymore around and all my kids are so used to all their own 

Recording: (5428/ 9621) 
and until the consumer becomes on the equal knowledge level as the uh it is always going to be an equitable and you are going to have a problem in our society because we do not need these large houses and so forth because as you progress an age it becomes a liability but then the developer i said well let us see well we can make condos down size and up and still and we want to make this we want to make this margin of profit yeah we do but what about for society is best interests 

Recording: (5429/ 9621) 
yeah that is true that is a pretty good advantage 

Recording: (5430/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5431/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5432/ 9621) 
yeah it is but see i always i i have one floor which where i live now i back him home i mean on just the type you know i did not want pet hair and 

Recording: (5433/ 9621) 
but yeah i in disciplined she is not she is not as strict as i am i do not 

Recording: (5434/ 9621) 
i do not know i do not know  i am sure it would happen because there is oh kind of way people out there  yeah seriously i do not know i have family members that are home in fact that is just my own personal thing believe i do not know i think that they should not have taken it off of the dm s whatever it was  i do not know 

Recording: (5435/ 9621) 
yeah you have you follow the script and uh that is real funny too like you know you get uh they they listen to you like they monitor the calls and uh you know they listen to you and it is like just sheet like if you asked for the specials and like if you you know sent it in this way and like if you used this or whatever you know in like um i do not know it is just real weird 

Recording: (5436/ 9621) 
oh i know it is so much fun 

Recording: (5437/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (5438/ 9621) 
and it is just like you people you see go to church they will walk out of church to see somebody sitting there that is homeless 

Recording: (5439/ 9621) 
gave people or straight people so 

Recording: (5440/ 9621) 
yeah when i first went to auburn i was a performance major in the french horn and looking back on it i wished i would maybe thought to major in music education or at least have a little bit of background in that because i am thinking it would have given me a little more dimension in terms of my my teaching possibilities and uh although i am certified to teach now in chemistry and uh earth science uh it might be nice to have the option of teaching music also 

Recording: (5441/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5442/ 9621) 
 right yeah 

Recording: (5443/ 9621) 
umhum i just got done doing some roofing and i was supposed to meet my girlfriend out there she never did show up so i had to walk from incredibly we are in incredible universities to be well just say hill yard and two seventy all the way back this way one campus without water  oh man talk about being stuck in the desert 

Recording: (5444/ 9621) 
just at home i just have a tape that i use it is cathy smith one of her things that i really like 

Recording: (5445/ 9621) 
i answered it right  

Recording: (5446/ 9621) 
person on she is pretty high up i guess i was on the on the way 

Recording: (5447/ 9621) 
but man should get that much information out so the other cop goes upstairs and christmas and her position of the story at this point is one moment i am geefully putting you on the computer and the next one one minute i i turn around there is a large police officer in the door  of your room he said hi you said i think you should come down stairs they do not talk guys anything so christmas comes down to the other side of the side and he says beside me 

Recording: (5448/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5449/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5450/ 9621) 
i do not argue with them i do not debate it it is just like it might 

Recording: (5451/ 9621) 
and being able to meet them quicker and more effectively i think so yeah oh yeahumhum umhum umhum umhum umhumumhumexactly just from family  yeah  umhum oh yeah yeah but something i have learned just from the other parents well mostly mothers that i you know talk to is that you know if it is not necessary to say it then it is necessary not to say it so it is just kind of uh in your home type of thing and you do not really go around saying yeah we sleep in the same bed and we breast feed still and  it just kind of they ask you like yeah well yeah that is just the way we are doing it so 

Recording: (5452/ 9621) 
no this real like to live off campus you have to well after my class it will be twenty two and senior credit status but my class was twenty one or senior or senior credit so i got to move off campus but like had i been a year younger i would not have been able to because i have so weights so twenty two so they 

Recording: (5453/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5454/ 9621) 
yeah i start early and she starts late so she gets the one daughter on the bus to go to school and then then she can take the boy over to the day care and then they are only there five hours or so 

Recording: (5455/ 9621) 
yeah and i am close to the ones that that feel the same way i do about things my oldest sister you know i could stay on the phone so long but we have such different opinions about things that yeah i do not stay on very long with her 

Recording: (5456/ 9621) 
and uh well she the the people that own it are starting to build it up now but it is been like that it was the first department community uh in columbus that was built in thirty eight i guess 

Recording: (5457/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (5458/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (5459/ 9621) 
there is some kind of tax program 

Recording: (5460/ 9621) 
ah it is kind of like um you go to the private school and you get there maybe seven years old one that is uh fifteen sixteen and it sixteen they can actually determine give you a test and sit down with you and ask you about different things and sixteen fifteen sixteen year old kid actually graduate from college you know being yeah they have they have showed that study already i mean i think it is i think it is amazing yeah i mean when that first heard about it they did not even have some doogie how they are hitting you know  but now it is just you know now it is kind of reality you know because i know pretty much know how to handle myself out in the wilderness  i mean you know go up on nature hikes and good fishing all that stuff just combined into one it is all about being an individual and if those teachers can not study with that individual know what that individual wants young then older kids are not going to know what to do end up practicing well and not liking it going on that school for it 

Recording: (5461/ 9621) 
 but it was interesting uh they did have uh assembleies where they they had religious assembly uh religion was not uh all in it was it is interesting the concept of eating somebody isly blood  it is almost cold like  and i am thinking i am starting to think well what really separation uh a religion from a cult  and that i think it is just that this social acceptance of it really almost um you know how many people are in it probably what number divisions them i am not really sure  yeah yeah well i i like uh i was i have in uh alternative energy fighting against nuclear power and uh they have been active at various times in animal rights movements and uh political campaigns uh foreign policy kinds of debates that kind of that kind of thing and one thing that i have noticed uh a lot is there are a lot of there are well there are there is a wide spectrum but in the uh there are a lot of liberals in the catholic church too  you know 

Recording: (5462/ 9621) 
uh we were floating around just did not know if they were going to send us the other night because it was toward the end of it 

Recording: (5463/ 9621)

umhum 

Recording: (5466/ 9621)

mixed and just keep an eye on what is going on 

Recording: (5475/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5476/ 9621) 
but the writing they give you one point for each paragraph so you have to get five points to pass now you might get four out of five and almost five and then you have to retake that one part 

Recording: (5477/ 9621) 
yeah we uh you have to concentrate on what is important or just flies by and you do not even see it

Recording: (5495/ 9621) 
yeah they are 

Recording: (5496/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5497/ 9621) 
and and that is what a lot of people are telling me you know just you know life just struggle 

Recording: (5498/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5499/ 9621) 
it it was not easy and at first it was probably a lot harder then after you have been there for about six months and you start to just get used to things but i i took for granted coming to amer going back here was 

Recording: (5500/ 9621) 
because you know this sun itself five already plays all these adding games and subtract games and leather games and you know at least the day care all the stuff they have on their computer is all education stuff that is not game game it it has a game theme to it but 

Recording: (5501/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5502/ 9621) 
i think that uh it would have been better for me if we had lived in new york 

Recording: (5503/ 9621) 
boy it would have to be um something that i actually enjoy um what happened was ever since i came to columbus almost every company i worked for was bought out and sold and moved to a different state and i was not interested in that uh because my husband works for the state so obviously he is not going anywhere um so i got tired of that and that is why i kind of went to dumping and stuff so it would be one with a variety um i am unfortunately i say unfortunately good of the counting and stuff but that does not get to express my creative side as much so it would be um my favorite job was one where i did the accounting but i dealt with people as well and like we do presentations at seminar and stuff like that occasionally too so right 

Recording: (5504/ 9621) 
and it is you know my mom you she always says well what should we you know what do you think i should do about this and we always talk about different things so i think i think it is kind of neat that i have been involved in a lot of a lot of the other kids that way 

Recording: (5505/ 9621) 
out of our dad is we had terminal that connected to us this to 

Recording: (5506/ 9621) 
now i just like it anyway and i like their culture a lot 

Recording: (5507/ 9621) 
fruits yeah and it is like what is the difference you know besides the price 

Recording: (5508/ 9621) 
but there are those that are out there that are willing to do that 

Recording: (5509/ 9621) 
you know they should not know where the keys are if they were kept or whatever i mean the fact that you know how do you explain your way out of your kids is taking them to school 

Recording: (5510/ 9621) 
which was scheduled in the evenings when i was working and i could not even go to therapy 

Recording: (5511/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (5512/ 9621) 
actually it is probably the closest place 

Recording: (5513/ 9621) 
oh okay  

Recording: (5514/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (5515/ 9621) 
my boyfriend went love to mess with us i just wanted to know he he take it out of part putting it back together 

Recording: (5516/ 9621) 
according to that and so uh i can not think what some of their observationsations were but they are sort of religious one or two lines of 

Recording: (5517/ 9621) 
she that is a grandmother she lets the kids pretty much you know 

Recording: (5518/ 9621) 
and they go she is got it and they go to the next guy and then all of a sudden you are going off this and they go uh this is nice julia uh where are you going and you are like uh well he uh told me to and then they go oh brother you know so now you know the attention is diverted to use though that is usually what the problem is because most pilots are they are real professional you know um 

Recording: (5519/ 9621) 
i have given you plenty of opinions have not i i have just loaded them on you okay i i just have a question is is this a research project for a private organization or is it 

Recording: (5520/ 9621) 
you know my parents never did because uh they knew i was always levelheaded i always had a lot of boyfriends you know that i always i always felt like i am just waiting for the right one 

Recording: (5521/ 9621) 
is that right 

Recording: (5522/ 9621) 
i mean instead of a doctor 

Recording: (5523/ 9621) 
humum 

Recording: (5524/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5525/ 9621) 
i can see i have been here twenty five years and i seen a lot of weird stuff the fact is when i was a bigger i seen a manager that had nothing to do for ten years 

Recording: (5526/ 9621) 
from the day one 

Recording: (5527/ 9621) 
yeah to but that the more that has primarily that has primarily because of necessity uh more often than not uh uh maybe even today it is less than that because it is been because of the loss of up parent they are the ability of up parent uh or parents uh being able to handle those children so yes those things again and they always have some but that is a very small percentage that has got 

Recording: (5528/ 9621) 
no matter how much money they are giving for their education they 

Recording: (5529/ 9621) 
when you think that our major resource is is our children in our off spring then we better not you know 

Recording: (5530/ 9621) 
uh we are plano moving in the spring 

Recording: (5531/ 9621) 
ah number one it is a little bit smaller more controlled area quiet and oh less and uh give my mom clisters sister you know my sister lives up there she moved there from uh down in west virginia so you know with mom having all the peace and peace and quiet she wants yeah plus in uh place that is only year old 

Recording: (5532/ 9621) 
right  

Recording: (5533/ 9621) 
um just to get into the school there is about thirty people applying they let three in 

Recording: (5534/ 9621) 
yeah they could be wrong yeah 

Recording: (5535/ 9621) 
yes to some degree they should but they will go again it is just like people when i worked in bars they would always want to hold the bargehander responsible but see you could come up i give you a beer and you could give it to somebody else 

Recording: (5536/ 9621) 
all the cool apartments are on one sixty one all the great restaurants and everything so that is where i live 

Recording: (5537/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5538/ 9621) 
um well actually it is sort of all happening in a certain area you know with you know very high unemployment like council council states um you know this sort of stereotypes you know kind of bad family environment you know parents have lots of boy boyfriend and girlfriend drugs everything else and you know a lot of these girls that have been interviewed you know say oh you know i wanted something to love or you know we were bored so we decided to have sex and i mean i find it just totally appalling and you know a thirteen year old boy who is interviewed with saying oh you know he you know slept with like ten girls or something i am thinking oh my gosh you know and he is thirteen and you know had a few kids and that was it but in my opinion the main problem there is they get more support even at that age when they have they you know they get unemployment because once they have had a kid even if they are not working age they get like uh an a certain amount of money and then once they reach i think uh fifteen or sixteen if they have a baby they are provided they are the top of the list for a council house so they get they are on there was actually a long document around before i left um you know of this girl who was constantly fighting with her parents and you know her parents were at the end of their oak she got pregnant and she was like well you know hey this is my ticket to move out because she gets her own place she gets money for herself money for the baby she does not have to pay any utilities or anything and you know one more could she want you know was basically what she was saying i have got my own place i can do whatever i want i am getting money and i do not have to work and and so that i think is a very bad situation because they are almost rewarded for you know 

Recording: (5539/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5540/ 9621) 
because i add a lot of frustration build up get a whole list there 

Recording: (5541/ 9621) 
so they do not want toyork 

Recording: (5542/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5543/ 9621) 
you know and without a health insurance that will cost a few hundred dollars and they have no means to help themselves at least if you assume you are eighteen you could get a job like in trying to pay for your health insurance i mean it i am not saying it would be easy but still 

Recording: (5544/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5545/ 9621) 
yeah and then you can stay as long as you want you do not you know feel obligated and everybody just brings in food you know everybody brings their own stuff and it is fun i mean yeah it is from thanksgiving to christmas i mean it is just non stop family everywhere so it is fun

Recording: (5561/ 9621) 
no no in fact the principal went she interviewed me asked me that and i said when we are raised in the unitary in sunday school it is uh it is almost an indoctration in tolerant for other religious  so you are better off with me than somebody that believes there is the only one tree religion

you went to be he was going to be a the gossip i heard was that uh uh the super and did not it schools said that if he was reelected and she was going to be a torn in her side  

Recording: (5563/ 9621) 
yeah well people people do not have the priorities that they should you know what do you do you work all your life and you make a lot of money and then you die what did you do you know did you learn anything did you teach anyone did you have an opinion about anything you know i mean that to me if you do not have time then you know you are just floating along trying to  take it up space now  

Recording: (5564/ 9621) 
yeah their age there is like two people who are like from the uh i mean they are not old but they are like from the forties and they have bought generations they bought water they have got extra food they have got a freeze extra freezer they bought ammunition that is like how low you know i just think it 

Recording: (5565/ 9621) 
they yeah well the grandmother she says she is a christian but i do not see it  i mean a lot of people claim they are something and you know which i might not be a total christian because i do not do all the right things but i do believe in god i do believe i am going to go to having that i try not to you know send too much and i do pray to them at night you know i just i do not go to church like i i used to go to church all when i was growing up and now i you know i feel like you do not have to go to church to please and god and all that you know i talked to them i talked to my grandparents that are going to have them in stuff you know that is just what i was raised as and 

Recording: (5566/ 9621) 
and i think especially they had two murders over there and i was publicized the columbus area but uh it is true 

Recording: (5567/ 9621) 
sure 

Recording: (5568/ 9621) 
and they might be something as easy as what are the three colors in our flag or uh how much of a uh how much do you have to have of the senate to pass the law you know it can be something real real technical or something that a three year old can answer because it is trying to hit you know all the areas that you have learned 

Recording: (5569/ 9621) 
but most most of the vegetables are available truly the zucchini the uh you will find your your green peppers smaller your i got a uh cucumbers the other day and usually they are so big and i tell you all of the thing was that long 

Recording: (5570/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5571/ 9621) 
i mean i obviously that is a long ways off um i i guess i imagine i would be teaching in public schools so hopefully i could kind of get to them  where i was but but i i do not know i mean maybe i do not know i i do not even know if it is double and really better than than to call them that is probably a 

Recording: (5572/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (5573/ 9621) 
yeah well he thinks he can do it 

Recording: (5574/ 9621) 
well the coach he is pretty much got it all together you know he just needs to put everybody in their own separate category instead of having one person for one part of the team and another person for another part of team and 

Recording: (5575/ 9621) 
yes yeah that is right you can not get a seat there  

Recording: (5576/ 9621) 
you are right on the top 

Recording: (5577/ 9621) 
they do not heard it all before and they some of them had known me for a few years but uh i do not please it my wife told after i retired that she was actually easier to get along with when i was there then they would not i do not please that yeah yeah umhum

Recording: (5581/ 9621) 
so you know what kind of example is he setting for everybody else 

Recording: (5582/ 9621) 
i made a difference 

Recording: (5583/ 9621) 
no offhand caesar i am trying to call up 

Recording: (5584/ 9621)

he talks about biting even though he is never bit and um there is one particular boy right now when his family lease he just has complete temper standards and he is tried that out a few times too he is one of them he is very comfortable with other people but like last month or so he is tried that a few times and i think he picks that up at day care seeing the other kids do that 

Recording: (5586/ 9621) 
 well exactly i mean there are split seconds where you just want to shoot somebody unfortunately anybody that says that i i mean i am i do not even like stepping on the edge but there is those moments where you are like 

Recording: (5587/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5588/ 9621) 
well i do not know if it is been around town here 

Recording: (5589/ 9621) 
oh yeah i think everybody should have it is nothing else she missed a boat by at that time 

Recording: (5590/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5591/ 9621) 
i i guess it is just over the course of the year everything balances out you know so 

Recording: (5592/ 9621) 
i am 

Recording: (5593/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5594/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (5595/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5596/ 9621) 
um most times i stayed around this little town uh it is like northwest of munac so it is southern um most folks 

Recording: (5597/ 9621) 
your uh 

Recording: (5598/ 9621) 
kind of dwindling  

Recording: (5599/ 9621) 
with the the children yeah 

Recording: (5600/ 9621) 
yeah i went to columbus public schools that uh did not yeah on on always over on the west side same area of town always lifters up there now uh came up here to i sheog uh and got my bachelor is in uh englishlet and they went to case western reserve for our masters the best i had wanted to go somewhere else in the country the i got my library degree and the only job i could find was there in columbus 

Recording: (5601/ 9621) 
but you know i think one of the things that you see people do a lot that really bothers me is that whole thing about 

Recording: (5602/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (5603/ 9621) 
yeah i i you know i think you know i would apologize to my oldest daughter almost every day about of course you know i put her through one we were trying to grow up together and i was twenty four which was born so i was not a child but it is like you do not have realistic expectations of what what children are capable over what they can do because if they are really verbal the menial kids always have been really verbal because i have talked to them from them from the moment they were born even you know when they could not talk to me that was their relevant i was talking to them the whole obviously see i do not shut up so i would talk to them the whole time and so they would always be really horrible and so it would seem like they had a much better understanding and could do things better than they really could like when my daughter was about five we got a hamster and i said well you know you make sure you give up food and water and when it died i was so surprised that she had not given it been giving him food and water because she did it occasionally but to a five year old you know yeah they do not get that stuff together or when she was eleven we sold her bedroom furniture and i gave her the money to keep so she could wait to buy something else within three or four months it was gone you know and so then the next year and a half she only had a address on the floor in the room because but i mean now they was bizarre and now with my other kids first of all i would have better sense than to do those things there i i would take more responsibility rather than expecting them to have it and secondly 

Recording: (5604/ 9621) 
anyway you know so just simply live in 

Recording: (5605/ 9621) 
the government you know whoever wants to be 

Recording: (5606/ 9621) 
you know everybody might be person to ever rely with their personal communication not the key my name personal versus universal on the communications and and in denveral finally or over a hundred and over here but whether we are in just you know personal or no warjohn dougar he has not the same he is not jingo he is over here all in the personal used to be they yes you can do this person right over here they can go to this and that 

Recording: (5607/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (5608/ 9621) 
you can not isolate yourself from them it is like americans americans do not have a have a have a strong hold on it  

Recording: (5609/ 9621) 
well i will be on the i have a lot of home it is actual friends and being in the restaurant business and growing up in the restaurant business and so i have really kind of met them when i was going to school i did not know any and i went to ou and onto down there i did not know i did not know anybody in book is game uh i feel that a lot of people or i will say most of them are all of them are born that way some of them do make a choice um but i feel that it should be talked about in school um for so long it was in the closet you know and they did not talk about it in these kids you know had to hide it and i just think in today is world and there is so many people that are only gay that that should be talked about more in school i do i think you know especially i just think some and women there is women that you know i had my gym teacher okay but now that i look at it i did not know then but she was great i mean we did not i did not think that then i do not know why but she was very manly but she was very she was very good but she was you know just not feminine at all 

Recording: (5610/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (5611/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5612/ 9621) 
umhum umhum yeah it is always kind of scary i think you really need to get away from that to get yourself back 

Recording: (5613/ 9621) 
and they are for him cool 

Recording: (5614/ 9621) 
i am trying to think uh they are they are a minor brand i know that is what we have it is like frito is instead of uh 

Recording: (5615/ 9621) 
oh somehow really yeah  and if they if everybody would just begin to be able that way and when they started to say something nice you would think well i want them to say that to me 

Recording: (5616/ 9621) 
so the way to university is run i can not agree with most of the stuff they did 

Recording: (5617/ 9621) 
changing to words does not change how someone feels about something 

Recording: (5618/ 9621) 
is that right they got 

Recording: (5619/ 9621) 
i met him here um the year i moved back from florida and he had just moved back from dallas he had lived there for ten years 

Recording: (5620/ 9621) 
i read and 

Recording: (5621/ 9621) 
of daylaw gunter one of their uh cartoons and the cartoons toward most of it 

Recording: (5622/ 9621) 
if i i did not own a telephone because i could not afford one and and also i thought if i had one they will call me well they would come you know if i did not get up that time on my day off they would come knocking at the door and say we need to come for a trip 

Recording: (5623/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (5624/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5625/ 9621) 
i hope not some of these longer to go around and always predict the worst things like everybody is saying then that you know two thousand happens do not go out and separate news the year is well it is got a end we will how does it go to end you know and 

Recording: (5626/ 9621) 
and otherwise than that i do not have hardly any trouble with the kids i have more trouble with the parents 

Recording: (5627/ 9621) 
um can you submit a poor fully on the fall for a view and they decide which students are good enough to be in the department 

Recording: (5628/ 9621) 
so uh you know now that is just like they consider that like urban 

Recording: (5629/ 9621) 
just employers need to be employers just need to do that on their own and it is tough to be able to trust uh business like that but it is a private business they need to be able to 

Recording: (5630/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5631/ 9621) 
lousy true like that they were good you know programs that is one of these hollywoods to the children but now they put some of those i can not understand some of these hollywoodsoh they would not even tell you the truth or anything i think i coulduh i was just was a few words of what you are meaning to say uh maybe wrong but i think your are recognizing to say we must get back to the family there must be two parents and they must recognize their children and uh do like you have just discussed uh do with them and say and because today we are just dripping and drid drafting and draftinging we uh fifty percent of everyone who married is divorced within a matter of about five years as i understand the statistics today and uh unfortunately it is still increasing but there is a strong feeling that maybe this going to slowly reverse or at least decrease not reversely uh once again we are talking about communications too uh and the communications can be ill and they can be great uh as she is touched upon uh but i feel that pinge of them fast to swing back from the nonsamly were headed toward or have been headed toward and get back to a very basic family or in station it it it is ab peopleorrent when is they sell uh four ten thousand dollars a piece and being planted another so they they and produce a quote beautiful child or a beautiful child uh and if you have talked about just the physical features is is meaningful it is what is in body in that body that is can be beautiful instead of just the physical features that you look at and that to me is ab people such a such an idea uh and that indeed is going to take away from family i can not in my way of thinking i can not imagine that i would uh have my wife producing somebody else is child over here and i am going to have the same thank god that should that fatherly love fatherly value fatherly instinct toward with that child 

Recording: (5632/ 9621) 
hm

Recording: (5638/ 9621) 
i would like to see it pass just for the fact to see what uh they would have done off the money but uh i do not blame any people for boating for the one or one because you are talking about something twenty years in engineering especially engineering friend years ago and uh as worth of down to chemical for which is over in double and they lived over where i am living now and every year they were doing them work on two seventy you know so i get pissed on them them been been been iting about it and everything you know and they go you know real nice you know by the time we get something approved through all the parameters you know and go through and everything and then they start working on it and then they get it done it is right ten fifteen years old

Recording: (5700/ 9621) 
you know the options that your but down i had to take them and down because i broke my ankle fall quarter

christians  

Recording: (5704/ 9621)

Recording: (5705/ 9621) 
or more accurately i think she took it but in it to fine line um and so she wears that around and i replaced it so i had my own again i wear this one around so we have a competition to see who you can get the most well traveled to bring you get two points every country and you get one point for every state or problems within that country 

Recording: (5706/ 9621) 
there were things out there was nothing like what they have today you know the small little handguns and things like that that are real easy carryable and considerable i mean like you know back in the sixties and stuff like that i mean they had switchblade and things like that i mean i mean there is really nothing too different 

Recording: (5707/ 9621) 
maybe 

Recording: (5708/ 9621) 
it is better in terms of the yard 

Recording: (5709/ 9621)

i do not mean i wish i knew what to buy this week 

Recording: (5713/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5714/ 9621) 
um scary okay and it it was funny because you see the cops first but in reality the cops behind two other people that actually know but as a matter because you always see cop is first so the two other people that actually know are my stepmother stepmother um parents stepmother and father have been split up four i do not know a month or two now they have been married for something like six months now and uh my sister and i both wanted to tell her a time that she was making a horrible mistake but she would not have listened to us so she would not bother telling her 

Recording: (5715/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5716/ 9621) 
and they mean i do not think a lot of people have ever heard of ecstasy into that movie 

Recording: (5717/ 9621) 
oh you how long have you been here 

Recording: (5718/ 9621) 
i had the same thing happen to my kid i i smack him one time 

Recording: (5719/ 9621) 
for felthers and everything but i think you know they get along these kids and they do not care about the school but they will they lead it early because they know they can do it 

Recording: (5720/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (5721/ 9621) 
right yeah 

Recording: (5722/ 9621) 
fire a couple around the pool right back in so uh that night our captain who there one of these gogo guys took one of our guns in the gun control they went up to where they could line line am on that 

Recording: (5723/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (5724/ 9621) 
oh he does a lot of maintenance he was doing drywall before this i kind of wish this that would that 

Recording: (5725/ 9621) 
he is always saying oh this is precious and that is racist but i do not think it is too bad in columbus i know their place is lots of south like the south and so on course uh who who really knows the race issue is such a big question 

Recording: (5726/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5727/ 9621) 
it is not amazing 

Recording: (5728/ 9621) 
oh yeah yeah 

Recording: (5729/ 9621) 
but i am not sure how it is going to work you know i mean i i did oh i wish you um website is under construction i am like wow during it so then you know my aunt works here and then all my cousins will most of them graduated here so kind of want to follow them  go with the flow but i you know i did some other ones you know eul and you know if you have this program can you tell me something about it and it was actually i think it was stanford it was on a tv show i think it was like extra or something i do not know what it was and they were had a program on where um these older students you know met for the first time in a at their graduation you know they finished their whole college on internet and i said well that would be very easy for me and i could do it at my convenience like when he is asleep i can go and do that and they can make it a lot easier to get up  getting up is a very hard task  very big bag slant against you 

Recording: (5730/ 9621) 
i do not know uh this freedom some i cause i freedom there is an allusion of freedom and a reality of freedom uh and then even people know the big difference of that 

Recording: (5731/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5732/ 9621) 
yeah so or how hard can it be to say to a student if you have a student with an aicu for example and you know he is not going to get all the details in the battles in the years and the captain is names but you just want to get the overall just to the french and american war was about this time of in history and this was the results and this is how long it lasted just the main concept where there was the kid that you say taught you study for the test and when you come in i will let you answer anything on the test you know and anything you do not know you leave blank and i will just grade what you put down 

Recording: (5733/ 9621) 
i know 

Recording: (5734/ 9621) 
the uh or the yeah the government mayors the you know but then look at them i mean there is another example well yeah that i mean  that is so that is not the that is not the case but it is all it is in uh man too you know i mean i think women would be more efficient than they would see those things because we have had to live with them forever you know even g movies that little kids are going to see if there is a woman in there 

Recording: (5735/ 9621) 
i 

Recording: (5736/ 9621) 
oh really 

Recording: (5737/ 9621) 
is very informedly or so i do not know what we were doing but 

Recording: (5738/ 9621) 
like that like salt area but like on the limited south area that does not seem right either but 

Recording: (5739/ 9621) 
hm 

Recording: (5740/ 9621) 
that is parents could pick him up and everybody was anoyd my husband said i would not have let her stay i do not understand why you are doing this i do not care i wanted to come home the other well the bottom line it was hysterical because she and this little boy they are outside and he they are jumping and he is jumping on the trampway and i go out to them and i air jeez myself and i say you know honey i said really sorry about the plans but i just you can i just could not let you have got her stay there that long he goes well that is okay my mom would never let me do that so i was not thinking you know here is on everybody is acting like i am the bad guy and i am i am the one who is into right and so they will i said they were very i saying it was funny because um there was something that she wanted to skip a play needful that i would not let her skip because it was for a party that our friends were having and i just then it was important to her but when you have commitment you you keep your commitment and so was saying he agreed with me and i said look even your dad thinks that in this case she goes so was it with him he never has an opinion how come all of a sudden he allowed to have an opinion tell me what i could do you know it was really funny we laughed about it and i let her um i let her step in  because i just decided that it was so important to her 

Recording: (5741/ 9621) 
yeah i mean but i mean we are not in a depression and and then you know the employment rate is fine and health cares we have got some improvements there and like i said that it is too long too  and something that you know but i just i mean so i might not saying he is done a a horrible horrible job but i mean i think that you just spend so much time focusing on other things to look at all the money that we wasted the money on something else you know and you end up doing that 

Recording: (5742/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5743/ 9621) 
i think they do well 

Recording: (5744/ 9621) 
is that the way jesus christ is what brought that here well some people have an opinion and they say no no i said you you wear that collar you do something about that if you do not then i realize what a small less person you are but you will never find me in your church again so i have done one i have done but and there is a lot of people out there that will read a book on native american spirit quality and they will become selfproclaimed spiritual leaders uh they will learn about the sweats there is some people that uh take him pictures of sweat lodges which you are not supposed to do well they show step by step how to build one and tell you it is some kind of wood to build it out of and ninety percent of the time they tell you the wrong kind of wood um there is a way to do it there is a way to do it uh it has to be done that way traditionally and there was a reason for that uh because the people this land were giving specific instructions from the creative divisions through a woman called the bought white buffalo and cat woman that came to the people and brought them dcary monies like to sweatage they brought them to the sticker pipe it is not a it is not a belief thing it is a way of life and it is a way of life that is still endangering being snuffed out but it will not be it is just it will not be it is just we have got to be careful about uh how what you do and if you look you know native american spirituality or a religion for the heck of a better word uh because our people believe in the religion you can not uh you can not accomplish one word everything that is into one word 

Recording: (5745/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (5746/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5747/ 9621) 
no not at all i think in the united states it is driving force by of our of our government and and even like because without without a revenue base from the taxes of corporations they could not have nearly the things that we have had and i think to a degree they become fairly powerful but i do not think that is necessarily a bad thing uh when the unions were really strong i thought like we were i was reading about it i thought that was a good thing as well because that supported supporting the person but you could if you have good relations with your labor you do not necessarily need a union 

Recording: (5748/ 9621) 
our dorms are cleaner 

Recording: (5749/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5750/ 9621)

Recording: (5756/ 9621) 
then she blew up on me too you know 

Recording: (5757/ 9621) 
um i can see where the people are coming from thinking that they might turn them into gay people or whatever uh just because obviously they you basically and then make your parents as far as what you do when you are young and things like that and obviously if you still had two male parents or whatever obviously you might be thinking  more towards like dating guys and things like that um i do not know if that would honestly happen 

Recording: (5758/ 9621) 
germany and everything that was really neat 

Recording: (5759/ 9621) 
and we started talking again and it was just like we had missed our time and started dating 

Recording: (5760/ 9621) 
yeah i mean i do not see any particular reason for her to wear the spendacks except for to appeal to a uh eighteen through twenty five male audience which i i think it does  

Recording: (5761/ 9621) 
convicted two white men in the third ones on trial now it would be interesting to see what happens to him because he says he did not have that big a role in it

Recording: (5769/ 9621) 
i sort of wore out um that and uh just oh there were two reasons i left one i was getting exhausted and uh it was justso demanding and we did not know as a community had let all up so i had  i had to withdraw another thing was i am very into uh medic physics in studying andmedating we had no time whatsoever everybody was in there uh that is one disagreement i have with intentional communities that they stay open all except in january so there is always people coming for four or five days and you have to explain everything in life to them in four or five days and plus we uh lived in uh uh a rural setting where we did everything ourselves plus ran a restaurant in a hardware and had a mail route and then we had all these visitors and then we and then we uh made our own bread and we uh milk to cow and  so it is just playing hard physical work plus all the mental uh stuff of dealing with people is really big questions it uh it was it does not  you know the that is the reason i ended quit is was like if i could leave this situation for a month or six weeks and get caught up within myself i would have been okay but that was not how it worked and so i would pull back from it  

Recording: (5770/ 9621)

Recording: (5777/ 9621) 
it is probably not as you know like you know as a expenses package like mister is there is because it is a you know you are off the way of the way you know you know spend sometimes to get there it is uh like you are like you would florida california and so it is like if you wanna get to the beach you do not want to say oh like memorial day so i can forget it you know just forget it it is like but that is right at least you do not have to worry about you know fighting the taurus

today society does describe the need entirely differently than what i would talking talking to this gentleman last night we got back and we were comparing uh our uh early life uh we did not even know what our nickel or our dime was uh those uh that was unimportant and we also were talking about how uh how we uh went i uh he was telling me a little bit by the said let me stop your paw i said paul what kind of shoes did you wear uh in the summer see we did not wear any shoes uhhuh and then i told him how we did not either i came from a very large family of mostly boys we would uh take our shoe off as soon as a year or as we could in their spring time we would uh store them in tallow in jars of tallow tallow is uh land large if you wanna call it that and that was a conservative and then when it became cold enough in september october maybe even as far as november this year would have been november this year and those shoes out and depending upon who is foot get those shoes those would be the person at home it would not be the one who had worn them in the spring because he is growing in the meantime and uh and it may go to another or another and i got to remember we pass huge down as many as four we children now my dad also repair his he repair his she is from our hair what to do that would be the most horrible thing is some of the kids that want i need me a pair of i do not know you will not uh advertising on here or not but it is not a i i want a nikeer i want a rockier i want i guess uh those that is a pure luxury no needs at all but today is society 

Recording: (5783/ 9621) 
just columbus is getting to big for where it is i mean that is why you have high crime rate high population population number one and uh i would say pretty soon if they do not cage it up a little bit you know just have enough residence for the area instead of people being homeless and you know jobless and everything like that i mean i hear in new york city where it is a lot more populated it is uh getting real bad of course you probably know about that 

Recording: (5784/ 9621) 
yeah we go actually we use the grand view library they have a really good library there and a large selection of videos and they have story time things where they read to the kids and get them interested in books and you know different type of things where you can win things for reading amount of books 

Recording: (5785/ 9621) 
i think it is just if it would be at and on best i think it is the authority thing you know you lie to me once you lie to me four hundred times sense and you know 

Recording: (5786/ 9621) 
that is right they just said they just asked it the wrong way 

Recording: (5787/ 9621)

Recording: (5832/ 9621) 
right they look at more what you have to say than your clothes and that that was a something i remember them talking about too you do not want them to look at what you are what you are wearing and that is mostly that was a good thing for the dress code 

Recording: (5833/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (5834/ 9621)

Recording: (5841/ 9621) 
okay  

Recording: (5842/ 9621) 
um yeah i hope we are going to get there  

Recording: (5843/ 9621) 
things get away from them at all yeah yeah so um i came down here because he knew where my parents lived and plus called him this was a lot more opportunity 

Recording: (5844/ 9621) 
um well i found that that i mean everyone has people from outside the united states have stereotypes about night with a couple of germans that i met at a coffee house uh i mean the the stereotypes that most americans have of germans or those of the veryans uh and not real bavarian but stereotypical bavarian uh beer drinking brought worse eating sour crowd eating liter hose wearing uh you know 

Recording: (5845/ 9621) 
until i try to so 

Recording: (5846/ 9621) 
do really somebody said you can like walk up this like it is the sort of stair case you can actually walk up to a head if you really if you really wanted to go up and walk up to put to the head you can do that  

Recording: (5847/ 9621) 
yeah and since it is not um sponsored officially by the um university they can do whatever they want and they do not have any uh possibly of um i am looking for a word hereuh red her questions 

Recording: (5848/ 9621) 
i have been some places where some men refused to sweat with women sometimes i felt kind of weird about it 

Recording: (5849/ 9621) 
i am a senior 

Recording: (5850/ 9621) 
i can 

Recording: (5851/ 9621) 
umhum so uh uh it is a an adjustment to get back into it but but i i do like it up there better as far as uh possibilities of uh working closer to home and stuff and not even the worry to about a bus and 

Recording: (5852/ 9621) 
they like the oh they are like the people in crock and dial they did not even be but they just you know they just like 

Recording: (5853/ 9621) 
i think for the most part people can handle it uh obviously i think probably more the older generations would be the ones that would have the bigger problem with it the ones that grew up like during the whole black rights movement and things like that uh i could see them having a problem with it but i mean more like more the generations of today or whatever like basically anyone down to the age of about forty or fifty so i think that they could they could probably deal with it i mean i do not think it could cause any huge problems or anything like that 

Recording: (5854/ 9621) 
that is right on their main street and they have gorgeous really neat neat things 

Recording: (5855/ 9621) 
because they done away with uh those little service step raises which were wrong because i could have done a crummy job and got the same rate as doing a good job do not get me wrong but now it is that you got people you do not even respect in management a lot of times even the raises and they have no idea what you are even doing 

Recording: (5856/ 9621) 
and there is like nothing in it and uh you know it is like going down the list that is what i do he he just thinks i i do not know how to clean the up mind reader  that is what it is  

Recording: (5857/ 9621) 
i am very proud of the way her and her sister are but i just think it is because mom was home and you know there was somebody there to listen to them and it does not see mom i mean um you know mom can go work and dad can stay home and there is nothing wrong with that either but i just think they need mom or dad they are everyday when they come home so they know when they come home and they have had a really bad day and something is really bother and they can talk to it as opposed to sitting for two or three hours and letting it kind of fade away and then when everybody comes home it is like well out in high school 

Recording: (5858/ 9621) 
you know i mean so it is true um with different pets 

Recording: (5859/ 9621) 
hm 

Recording: (5860/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5861/ 9621) 
yeah because of the traffic but see where i live i could get on the bus if i just wanted to go downtown real bad 

Recording: (5862/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5863/ 9621) 
it is huge number of second but she is already dialing and everything so the doctor has said before thanks giving he thinks you know 

Recording: (5864/ 9621) 
i do not know all the names of them but 

Recording: (5865/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5866/ 9621) 
and i was only about fifteen years old i am going like what the hell is this what is going on i mean i did not know who was president then but you know  i knew that there is a couple people 

Recording: (5867/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5868/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (5869/ 9621) 
uh i have always had an interest in german history and also in eastern european history and i mean it seemed to be a natural way that i could tie those two together for a thesis 

Recording: (5870/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (5871/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5872/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5873/ 9621) 
i had three uh they are all grown up maybe kids as own i have grandchildren from that age  

Recording: (5874/ 9621) 
but he he he he 

Recording: (5875/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5876/ 9621) 
oh yeah yeah 

Recording: (5877/ 9621) 
and i mean it is it is so easy to spell it is easy to say and you know we you can sort of it to m or 

Recording: (5878/ 9621) 
um well actually i wanted to learn more about it i felt like the guy i really have no passion towards it but i thought this would be a good way to learn about it maybe pick up like uh 

Recording: (5879/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (5880/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (5881/ 9621) 
uh which which the the as far as the the 

Recording: (5882/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5883/ 9621) 
who who 

Recording: (5884/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5885/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (5886/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5887/ 9621) 
i experienced it well i uh in some of our saramunies you know uh this is a potential right no one else is going to see this because i do not want to um i do not want to have a uh just printed or anything you know on to 

Recording: (5888/ 9621) 
yeah gotten to a situation where you really were not there is no wind situation from the get going uh uh i think that had we been able to do what we went over there to do initially that would have worked out okay but we were not so so the capital political war is everybody knows anything about it 

Recording: (5889/ 9621) 
not in my lifetime he would have to probably be a classic a 

Recording: (5890/ 9621) 
well that is just it that is part of it because like i see my parents would not come my mother used to try to come to things at school with i would be in different things and and i have really did approach but my father would not he just he would say well you know he just does not like that kind of thing i mean i would be in the sun a spelling i would be in the he he does not well do it and and i would get your butt down there and pretend like you like it and so you know was our field and my husband is the same way his family was he his father die when he was nine he was like the adult in the family he came from a buffalo new our working class he left he never looked back either and so it is kind of like you know i have people people i they say you know how we are such i i do not know we get the schools are always so grateful to us because we organize the state check tournaments he started the baseball league for the spelling you know he he does a lot of stuff i do a lot of stuff and it is simply because we are so grateful to have this family to be able to be a part of these kids lives and to go to uh i mean coach is baseball he has this you know um basketball we do not miss anything you know it does not matter what it is 

Recording: (5891/ 9621) 
when 

Recording: (5892/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5893/ 9621) 
oh yeah it is 

Recording: (5894/ 9621) 
no because them kids still stop at my house 

Recording: (5895/ 9621) 
she does a really wonderful job because she has a fair for interior design and so that you know presents itself in her the way she sets everything up in the stores it is very attractive 

Recording: (5896/ 9621) 
yeah i have been three i did not really know anything heart attack had too much that good stuff 

Recording: (5897/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5898/ 9621) 
uh basically what you need more is like recreation centers or something in their own neighborhood 

Recording: (5899/ 9621) 
kids because a lot of times maybe they do not get that at home so they are really looking to choose the right thing to do and through school and through education that is their avenue to go there 

Recording: (5900/ 9621) 
so that like it is just the sheer numbers of it i think 

Recording: (5901/ 9621) 
first year uh finishing it up oh yeah  oh 

Recording: (5902/ 9621) 
and so uh my parents retired here let us see they have been here i do not know four or five years maybe 

Recording: (5903/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5904/ 9621) 
 um and sure i feel like uh it is just different than i thought so if i come happy in a place like i should not stay and just be miserable about it 

Recording: (5905/ 9621) 
jerry i mean jerry springer 

Recording: (5906/ 9621) 
thinking um design 

Recording: (5907/ 9621) 
my god 

Recording: (5908/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5909/ 9621) 
my sisterinlaw is one of them she is just too stupid 

Recording: (5910/ 9621) 
because of each you know that he will need that someday i would never have done it 

Recording: (5911/ 9621) 
tied up to you know i think they deserve to die because the the prisons and the overcrowding that is a whole another subject you know that it is just amazing to me to so many people from there that should be dead i feel because we are just paying for them to live in there 

Recording: (5912/ 9621) 
wow yeah 

Recording: (5913/ 9621) 
i do not i do not know if that is what perpetates it is very different in the public schools and the catholic school and the public school you have all the problems in society in the school you have the drugs you have the absentee parents you have the delinquent see on the catholic school they just you do not have that for one thing uh you know it is oriented around a church even though we are not catholic it is still oriented it says it is on values the permitates everything well they do not do that in the public school because if you do that somebody is going to get ticked off its in the wrong value and why are you doing this to my kid um so i think that is missing and that is a problem within the school the public schools uh so there just seems to be more you are not from the educational process you know i mean when you are in the cadillacs going you are in classroom they deal with the discipline if they need to of course by the point they deal with it they take the real problems and send them back to the public schools  uh but in the public schools you just have to deal with this all the time and i think it if it is harder for the teachers to teach because there is too much stuff in the way of what they are they relate they are there to do 

Recording: (5914/ 9621) 
um i went to i applied to amory harvard duke university of chicago and washington university so i got into three of those and they they were neat placesum 

Recording: (5915/ 9621) 
yeah there was you know there was no property 

Recording: (5916/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (5917/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5918/ 9621) 
and by the end of the first week or two they were no longer scale to the magic box than could continue to operating systems um the gullible operating systems is real simple if you are playing with computers and you screw something up the worst thing you can possibly do is screw it up so badly that you have to start over 

Recording: (5919/ 9621) 
i do not even know what their holidays are i i do not know 

Recording: (5920/ 9621) 
i would think so but it was like it is too close to my north or at least 

Recording: (5921/ 9621) 
i mean i think that is the best way to address it and as far as the home as actual i think there is kids who say well maybe i am okay i do not know if i am care right well hopefully they will know their trueidentity eventually 

Recording: (5922/ 9621) 
oh which is most of it is horrible and they have always find some way to misre present like uh khrush 

Recording: (5923/ 9621) 
 directly yes 

Recording: (5924/ 9621) 
there must be something good to get on your tape and they have got people over there where i work at that they will give them the days off as their cats are sick 

Recording: (5925/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5926/ 9621) 
no i do not think it was because i grew up just basic not even really christian just really not no real religion and i had been going to the protterian church as i was about nineteen years old looking for something at church i just had a feeling that i wanted to have that in my life because i never had that before and so i was just looking around and i was open to anything i would listen to eastern religions and i have listened to joe was witnesses and and then when i read in the book more of it is just i as a feeling of like like i felt like i had heard it before and it made sense to me and and so that is why i really felt at home with us and that is why i just i 

Recording: (5927/ 9621) 
oh yeah  

Recording: (5928/ 9621) 
so that is probably the roof right that uh 

Recording: (5929/ 9621) 
with thebacp 

Recording: (5930/ 9621) 
 i figure when the time comes i just have to figure it out  

Recording: (5931/ 9621) 
and makes her look good 

Recording: (5932/ 9621) 
oh do you want to run over those are running over 

Recording: (5933/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (5934/ 9621) 
i think 

Recording: (5935/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5936/ 9621) 
well i mean young gets on the way to cast that girl who is from a large catholic family and their kids are going to a catholic school 

Recording: (5937/ 9621) 
whoa that is a pretty heat movie 

Recording: (5938/ 9621) 
great  because he is having his back  oh yeah that is what everyone says you think  

Recording: (5939/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5940/ 9621) 
but uh then there is a lot you know that they could do without them all too that might not be easy to go i do not wanna go there more 

Recording: (5941/ 9621) 
umhum umhum 

Recording: (5942/ 9621) 
um i have it personally good but i have seen uh i would personally research it if i was a president uh documentaries and whatnot and things on twenty twenty which i do not wholeheartedly believe just because it is on tv and they say it so but if it is true and it probably is just because a lot of people will research it once it is on tv um that three strikes that you are out has really seemed to work in california because most of the people that are committing the violent crimes with guns or rapes or what not um are doing most of the crime so once they are locked up yet costs more money to house them for life but they are saving so much because crime has gone down because these people are in jail now on the streets anymore so they do not have to catch them and i like to process them et cetera um so i would really like to see that and plus i think once that really is in the work and really working and we really do what we are going to say we are doing instead of like little parents no i did not do that no i did not do that you know what i mean because i think that is part of our problem too 

Recording: (5943/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5944/ 9621) 
what is the deal today when i was a kid you did not want to be barred of the police you are actually scared of the police nowadays what is the kid scared of nothing 

Recording: (5945/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (5946/ 9621) 
i would not know that is why i would not do the hiking things i do not like great i can get like a visa because that is so expensive and well you know you get uh some places and you know they might have some problems getting a taurus visa to sometimes they work illegal 

Recording: (5947/ 9621) 
no i have not 

Recording: (5948/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5949/ 9621) 
they they 

Recording: (5950/ 9621) 
play with them take them in on the kitchen floor so we can room around because our kitchen is like open 

Recording: (5951/ 9621) 
just carrying around the gun and shooting someone 

Recording: (5952/ 9621) 
you know it is a real worry did not you really have to think about it when you start getting there because it was tough dropping them off when they were six weeks old and you are going oh jeez are we doing the right thing you know but you know some of this stuff they do and some of this stuff they learn and come home with and we sit down and talk about it and we are just like i do not think we could have ever dreamed up all this stuff you know and you know kept them entertained all day long by ourselves you know there is no kids in the neighborhood like it was when we were kids you know they are all at day care they you know and they just are not around anymore it is not the same anymore where you know every other house had some kids and mom was home and stuff so you know they have made a lot of friends through there and they still the daughter who is in a different school still associated with friends that are in other school systems that she met at the day care so 

Recording: (5953/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (5954/ 9621) 
uh it counts if you are touching the ground or something that you are sitting on the touching 

Recording: (5955/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5956/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5957/ 9621) 
oh yeah her 

Recording: (5958/ 9621) 
oh we have um dustoh little oftenbredge 

Recording: (5959/ 9621) 
all right 

Recording: (5960/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5961/ 9621) 
it would be nice but now um so 

Recording: (5962/ 9621) 
i i do not care about like how many do it like my mom even wants me to do hers over summer but okay you know i do not 

Recording: (5963/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5964/ 9621) 
and uh oh did they 

Recording: (5965/ 9621) 
right right 

Recording: (5966/ 9621) 
yeah and you know i i would i would have to have another job but i would i would love i know you will say this is really stupid but i would love to have a monday through a friday eight to five job never work another evening a saturday or a sunday if if can be now i know i will probably not be able to do that because i wish you wants me to come back there so as a contractor so i do not know you know 

Recording: (5967/ 9621) 
and finally i do not know whether there is or we had a paper of cut into space in plain and i do not know whether hboa or who but anyway they found he they say good that he was in a a a a tungar for the railroad 

Recording: (5968/ 9621)

Recording: (5984/ 9621) 
umhum um 

Recording: (5985/ 9621) 
lived in the darn so i freshman year and then i moved into a house with a bunch of guys on that you know so well it different um one of those things that i really enjoyed that was different as the traffic and that really no that really that really became really became uh interesting in different for me when i started working for a career service winter quarter i took off i took all classes off winter quarter and worked for career service and i need some money and i love driving and let me tell you it is really really different driving around in the big city compared down the country man i mean you are flying down seventy one or seventy threes down and you go as fast as everybody else is going and if they are going eighty you are going eighty  and if they are going two you are going two you know i mean my dad i brought him down to columbus a few times because my dad and i are real close and um i am driving around and i will zip in between cars and he is like i forgot what it is like living in the city because he used to live in chicago but um that is one of the things i really enjoy one of the things i do not like about living in the big city is is like but i have gotten used to but i i do not like in fact that every time you look up in the nice sky all that you see is this like orange haze  you can not see stars very well uh the noise i mean there is always noise i remember last year living in the dorms every morning at two thirty in the morning there was a trash truck that picked up some trash from a bar right behind where we lived and i lived in taylor so it is this it is it is in a t shape and the the side of the building all the sounds just rolls right up the wall and this trash truck made so much stinking noise it is ridiculous every single morning at two thirty yeah i did not i i developed uh i developed the the the ability to sleep through anything which is and that is that is uh one of the fascinating things when i go home dead silence dead silence and that is now where i have a problem sleeping because because there is no noise there is no noise i am so used to like turning my radio on and drowning out all the background sounds that i have to like have music on in the room soum yeahat night life everything in in high thirty ten oclock and it all starts up at nine thirty ten oclock here in columbus and that is so oh other than that i love going out club in it like two oclock in the morning  um redsone redsone we usually they open up at nine or ten oclock depending on if they have got a special show coming in or not but that is the place i really like on um they uh they are open till usually two thirty two oclock all depends um i will see on something fascinating um i uh came to columbus and you know raised and is really really really conservative extremely christian religious community of asheland and i came to columbus and i started meeting you know i started meeting the extremely taboo group of homosexuals and i have found some of those fascinating people on this planet are homosexuals um and they are not nearly they they are not the the the evil people that that everybody back home and our community always said they were you know it is just like these are normal people you know i may not agree with what they are doing but they are not normal people and i have got some really cool people who are who are on the specials and that leave where that was going was um we went to access which is uh one of the home it is one of the gay um uh dance clubs in columbus it is um it is on high street it is down in uh it is down in a german building now it sounds like the movie it is down 

Recording: (5986/ 9621) 
i am 

Recording: (5987/ 9621) 
you know they want to be judge is like everybody else but i you know i think um i i think there is always going to barrier their their just kids who are just not all kids are going to get along you know i mean 

Recording: (5988/ 9621) 
back ground 

Recording: (5989/ 9621) 
and you know you have a hard thing there but then if you teach the teachers that they are not going to be quite and they are not going to you know um look at this flatterie 

Recording: (5990/ 9621) 
we have not been there in a while but i mean we do go 

Recording: (5991/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5992/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5993/ 9621) 
and so it it is the thing is though it is almost like i am really glad that i am willing to say i just can not make this he let he let my daughter who is thirteen he loved love for the movies one night they went to the movies they was no uh the movie they went to see was sold out the next one was not going to start until nine thirty which means just gets twelve years old so that would have been eleven thirty twelve you know at the l anyhow he left her there and they said they called me but i did not i was running the sleeper so i did not have the phone so after there and he said that she was going to call back you know at a certain time and i was going to tell her what she could or could not do so i said you know we are going to have to come here at home you know he is going to have to come and get you all come on and on and on and no we are not going to do that i you know you can not be his plate so he went back down and picked him up and i said let the kid come to our house he can come here until eleven 

Recording: (5994/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (5995/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5996/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (5997/ 9621) 
yeah  yeah  

Recording: (5998/ 9621) 
you know you know i mean 

Recording: (5999/ 9621) 
the bad plays of television things that they have on the programs they have on and i think that they have had a lot to do with changing our younger generation and the way they think the way they act what their morals are and i think that is why they are having more shootings in schools and uh i the programs are terrible i think that they need to really redo them there is too much for fantasy there is too much sex there is too much just do what i want i got to do my own thing that is why the when the i want to do my own thing started he says with the women is feminine this movement  and it probably did and it probably did have something to do with it uh because as i said i am just speaking up and they want to do things with mine well we will bring across you know uh 

Recording: (6000/ 9621) 
there is the ones that will get out there with their pickup signs they will raise how okay 

Recording: (6001/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (6002/ 9621) 
yeah exactly and it just uh it is just ridiculous but so many people do not seem to think that way i do think yeah access it would help us access were restricted or at least if they were more careful about it i mean it seems like even the laws that they are on place now are not necessarily followed and you know that kind of thing 

Recording: (6003/ 9621) 
because they are so styly 

Recording: (6004/ 9621) 
it is difficult you feel alone a lot of the time uh and i am not as liberal as i used to be uh so i think from the age it gets tempered a little bit but still tend to be a little more liberal and it is uh you know it is as to matter who i vote for they are going to lose uh and i just stay out a lot of discussions it was interesting but our mother raised us in a way that we were always allowed to discuss politics and religion anything we wanted to uh but you know she would stop if we got to point where we were getting physical or name calling or something like that and it was long after i left home actually before i realized that not everybody is that way not everybody wants to hear your views uh so i particularly around my inlaws they are very conservative of southern ohio uh raised during the depression uh in a depressed area so uh i learned my motherinlaw took anytime she disagreed with her his a personal attack on her so i just learned just about to see anything yeah uh my fatherinlaw was not that way but my motherinlaw was 

Recording: (6005/ 9621) 
very different uh just been a lot of invasions 

Recording: (6006/ 9621) 
um i mean in fact of the matter is if being a is a genetic disorder then that should have no effect on the kids because they should still be uh normal i guess or whatever you want to say 

Recording: (6007/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (6008/ 9621) 
um well because my cousins and uh they all have uh they are very you know well educated and they are more affluent and i think that uh maybe there would have been more opportunity for my dad there 

Recording: (6009/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (6010/ 9621) 
he found out he could just move yeah so you know he always got away from that 

Recording: (6011/ 9621) 
oh you have two nowadays you know i do not understand the men nowadays that believe that the wife still does all the dutiesies at home plus has a full time job that just does not happen now now you know if your wife did not work you could expect these things but she is doing forty hours a week too so it is it is work and it is a full time job and they start she the seven year old just here it is at the end of the year she is second grade she brings home this project going to have to have a book report used three books of half friends you know she is never done anything like this it was the battle all weekend long and they are getting this information out over her you know she had to pick an animal and do a whole report on it you know so you are going to have to stand up in front of the class and make a box with a display in it and i was just like this is second grade this seems more like you know there seems so much more advanced than when we were kids you know i can not believe in second grade we were already writing curse of already that is all she writes in now i mean that seemed like they were teaching it then maybe you may be learning something yeah she is in fractions she is doing fractions she is doing percentagesages already in second grade and i thought we were one plus one two you know and i am saying oh it just seems like they are three years ahead so 

Recording: (6012/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (6013/ 9621) 
next afterward umhum 

Recording: (6014/ 9621) 
so i do not know just like him  

Recording: (6015/ 9621) 
umhum and then they end up okay anyway  that is good  

Recording: (6016/ 9621) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (6017/ 9621) 
well yeah we got broken into uh i think twice and stuff got stolen my truck is been broken into my mom is car is been broken into the gas life and pretty much everybody around there is been uh criminalized one way or another 

Recording: (6018/ 9621) 
yeah so if it is come to mentality if my parents did okay without it then i do not need it 

Recording: (6019/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (6020/ 9621) 
you know how far they held responsible i do not know you would have to go on a case by case basis 

Recording: (6021/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6022/ 9621) 
yeah uh 

Recording: (6023/ 9621) 
and i did have a very serious relationship in florida uh he was quite a bit younger than i was and i knew he wanted children and i never wanted children unfortunately i i love animals and things but i just never decided i never wanted children and i knew he eventually would so uh i was engaged in them but i decided to 

Recording: (6024/ 9621) 
wow i am getting i am getting it to a  

Recording: (6025/ 9621) 
humum humum 

Recording: (6026/ 9621) 
to the most part yeah i mean obviously like they said they came out and said the catholic church was against it but at the same time like research things like that where they are saying that it could be a mental disorder or some sorts where i mean they could not can not so much really condem it to to the point anymore that they used to 

Recording: (6027/ 9621) 
but it is because most people would have sold it and moved to a more expensive home and had a bigger mortgage so it is just that kind of thing 

Recording: (6028/ 9621) 
i do not know actually probably if i went up there now i would like it but you know but it is not uh uh i do not like it as well as columbus at all mainly i suppose because of the university anyway yeah 

Recording: (6029/ 9621) 
just you know 

Recording: (6030/ 9621) 
the world uh really i am talking about that but my exwife got family here so uh you know she comes in about two or three weeks at least of the summer 

Recording: (6031/ 9621) 
i heard about that but the same principle applies but i am talking about just everyday things uh that uh people is when we when you talk to talk to talk to children primarily uh there is no penalty anymore uh parents are scared to death uh to pick uh one up and spank them or even with their bare hands or or to make them stand in the corner because they consider them go back to the word harassment child abuse and our harassment of consequence uh and uh uh and penalty can be a very very simple thing a mother can simply look at james and jany you should not do that 

Recording: (6032/ 9621) 
oh yeah um 

Recording: (6033/ 9621) 
well yeah i think it is real important to really get a good uh feel for how you are and all your beliefs and all that they have to really match and um and if they do not um then it is not ever going to work because there is always going to be conflict and friction and all that kind of thing so i think it is real important and there is no age limit on that to when you really feel good about yourself when you really know what you want to do then that is the only time that you can really commit and say yeah we do have a mutual thing in young people there you know there is so many different inf actuallyations to start with that they get blinded and they get you know off course and everything else and and then it does not stay the same i mean it is all exciting and and all that and then you know i think it is kind of  

Recording: (6034/ 9621) 
uh blue diskout 

Recording: (6035/ 9621) 
like do not go out  you betty much you are tvs you are entertainment for the year 

Recording: (6036/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (6037/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (6038/ 9621) 
when he died um i was about thirty 

Recording: (6039/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6040/ 9621) 
i know the valedictorian of harvard lake in the junior class 

Recording: (6041/ 9621) 
yeah much too fast for me uh uh 

Recording: (6042/ 9621) 
connexting some wires across up here or something and they are so they become very distrustful of adults because all their life people have been saying 

Recording: (6043/ 9621) 
yeah yeah  

Recording: (6044/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (6045/ 9621) 
that uh encompasses the uh theory that all things happen for a reason even though it seems like it is chaos even though it seems like it is an accident uh there is a flow of spirit in this world on things are moving at a pace that they are supposed to move that and things happen and death is part of life physical death and that is one of the things i also learn to that so that you do not die you do not physically maybe you know there is no annoying to it but spiritually not even physically you know not even physically made me you know there is no people in the you know there is no deny that but spiritually not even physical death can break that at once 

Recording: (6046/ 9621) 
right i think that is pretty neat 

Recording: (6047/ 9621) 
and um 

Recording: (6048/ 9621) 
yeah i have a problem  that one you that one that you that you you wish you had those kind of problems huh  

Recording: (6049/ 9621) 
they had this little apartment she is from india um 

Recording: (6050/ 9621) 
and do you like that 

Recording: (6051/ 9621)

Recording: (6052/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (6053/ 9621) 
he likes meat too 

Recording: (6054/ 9621) 
which could change 

Recording: (6055/ 9621) 
just a job  that is another thing job 

Recording: (6056/ 9621) 
uh i think i think it is i think it is fair i think it should be that domestic partners should be should be covered i think there should probably be some uh 

Recording: (6057/ 9621) 
yeah we had a my mom has a friend that does ultra sounds 

Recording: (6058/ 9621) 
do they think that we would be ready 

Recording: (6059/ 9621) 
you know he had he had 

Recording: (6060/ 9621) 
and it is not 

Recording: (6061/ 9621) 
you know when he is up at night i i have to do it for my responsibility you know and i mean people think that you know oh you get a lot help in there  they have their way to come to mind you know 

Recording: (6062/ 9621) 
did not have it done through saramony nothing like that and even the man that he followed for a while is sitting in a rest home over in south dakota now because he is old he was on his way out and he was a road man gave his life you know for eighty nine tribes they helped him find and refine their connection with their spirit drive that they would lost um because of the missionaries bringing christianity i mean uh 

Recording: (6063/ 9621) 
yeah my my best friend lives in on outside campground and she has a lot of medical problems but uh 

Recording: (6064/ 9621) 
uh i was exposed to a lot of men who were not brought up as as i was but they were a lot of them that were 

Recording: (6065/ 9621) 
the name i uh actually read a story in some book about this black lady that was having like her ninth and tenth kid and she did not know what she had twins and she did not know what to name them and she would run out of names that she likes so they brought her um lunch into her and the nurse jokingsly said or the aid or something well he is picking a couple of names off the menu so she named them limand jello and or per ongello lemon jah and orange jhe she picks lemon jheoronge jhe and orange and turned them into limand jello and or ongello  the niece and the nephew  

Recording: (6066/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (6067/ 9621) 
you know technically there is insanity and there is an insanity but in my opinion there is nobody who ever kills anybody who is an insane and uh just to to knock them out is is not appropriate they need to be we need to try to save them i mean not in the terms of a christian saving but uh to make them work that off and uh face it and come in their own mind to their own guilt and uh  andum so i have got two sites to that once they need to work because they did it in other areas if we keep uh i i believe in the uh uh uh reincarination the law costsin effect and if a person murders somebody they need they will they will pay for that later there is no question about that in the next life but also i think that they should be made to face their uh their guilt in what they have done and and a lot of them do not they say that hardened criminals real hard criminals will not ever admit that they did anything wrong and they have to they need to 

Recording: (6068/ 9621) 
get them thinking about it and then they will start going notice it in their real life and once they start noticing it they will start getting more and more into it 

Recording: (6069/ 9621) 
say oh well here is son is going to be he is too right now that is you know you know changes is so it so it does not come out to be a problem or whatever but i mean i think they need to leave that to the decision of the people 

Recording: (6070/ 9621) 
it is 

Recording: (6071/ 9621) 
you can not you can not be mad at somebody for choosing life style you just can not life is too short you know i mean you can love them either way it does not make any difference 

Recording: (6072/ 9621) 
right the same way with kids if you have a penalty for them they will learn their lesson but it is also the parent that has to set the example and there is too many older folks right now i do not think because of two people have to work outside the house they get home they are aggravated they are upset somebody else is had their kids all day and it is it is it is terrible that the situation is got that way but i do believe that the older people including our government people and everybody that is at the top has to set the example and stick with it 

Recording: (6073/ 9621) 
and she was speaking and and she started to speak i realized you know another thing that everybody feel has this tremendous impression on how we as people are doing here that how the politicians are because the world in essence is getting smaller because the communication has gotten better and all these other countries and us are just like all one country anymore or something and i think that is had a tremendous influence also on our politics and on we as the people 

Recording: (6074/ 9621) 
oh uhhuh 

Recording: (6075/ 9621) 
now that was up to age eight forth i that is that is the family uh i think that we in our educational program we really need to start teaching uh what i call the older values but but good values i do not look at any whether they are older new but good values and i think we really need to have that established within our educational system uh starting in the elementary right on up through college i think there ought to be a number of college uh courses uh that uh devoted exclusive for this so that those students can go back and uh uh assistant in teaching but i think that many of the courses other courses ought to have elements within them that are teaching value family values uh i could even still go so far as to see any chemistry or aousny or psychology uh any one of those those are specialized subject and and but i think there are elements that they can have within each one of those talking about family value family value uh and i would well help then permit the entire society and but it is got to start back here in the first i think 

Recording: (6076/ 9621) 
and sooner or later you know all the people that have gotten into political offices and public service a guarantee they went in it with the ideal of wanting to help them make a difference but but once they get in there it is such a bureaucracy 

Recording: (6077/ 9621) 
and it is not just like one group of people 

Recording: (6078/ 9621) 
that that is what making these kids think they they can do it i just really think 

Recording: (6079/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6080/ 9621) 
oh you do now 

Recording: (6081/ 9621) 
 yeah 

Recording: (6082/ 9621) 
in english umhum 

Recording: (6083/ 9621) 
yeah so i i have experience in that and i i am thankful that it was always a peaceful sort of thing  what is going on inside your head and your body is not that peaceful yeah 

Recording: (6084/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (6085/ 9621) 
for example so you should name her camera 

Recording: (6086/ 9621) 
so i have just the same opinion i think most people have it as as tv 

Recording: (6087/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6088/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6089/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (6090/ 9621) 
pots never been uh never been associated with any kind of a crime that was some a violent crime 

Recording: (6091/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6092/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (6093/ 9621) 
then you have a choice there you would not necessarily uh have you should have had more self control and i had the child do not expect me to pay for your uh lack of uh will power that that is a selfish attitude that is stealing as well 

Recording: (6094/ 9621) 
i see no i mean it 

Recording: (6095/ 9621) 
in a way yeah i think that would be good yeah movie a new name 

Recording: (6096/ 9621) 
uh the crime you can not really stop and other things that happen just you know too much partying around i mean that is why left full of had any because they could not you know but you know just everybody other than neighbors being allowed and everything my mom is older so she can not really put up with any of that and 

Recording: (6097/ 9621) 
i have just kind of appalled what they put on the news anyway it is not usually what i consider news it is a lot of human interest stories and things like that which 

Recording: (6098/ 9621) 
i really and it is bizarre 

Recording: (6099/ 9621) 
um i do not know i mean i i like florida just because it is not cold and it is it is really nice but it rains a lot i mean and i do not i mean i i would rather live out west because it is like a dry heat as opposed to being i mean it is nice that it is ninety degrees but it is not ninety percent humidity i mean that is kind of that kind of stuff but um it is just different to live in florida and how you think of florida being is real different like um i like because it is kind of it is the driveers are not so insane like they are here like people are a little bit more laid back just because like um i do not know in parts it is really insane but like sometimes it is just people are just like because it is all because it is nice weather people do not get so like aggravated by like here it is like cold in in gray and you just want to like yellow people in their car and stuff or something i do not know i do not know if you will still is 

Recording: (6100/ 9621) 
basically because of plans which the utilities had for our location they could not provide to us because of the uh the best of our own so we had to go out and um and do our own surveys become self educated through uh courses uh through at&t and through purdue university it was and i think oh you had some courses and uh ultimately the university here now has i think a major in telecommunication group but uh the projects basically we were going from a uh putting them together on network itself and uh we had a you think of a pay line system where they used to call daisy chain in the industry uh you had to wait and wait for you turn to get onto a data network and uh we got down to the point where in fact we went to a spook network where everyone has dedicated pipe 

Recording: (6101/ 9621) 
uh been yeah i was not much i my being here and my daughter being here i did not really have the uh time with her than i wish i would have had you know but uh uh her mother would you know did they are all right and everything but i wish i would have been more involved in their growing up and i think two people families are generally better you know for not necessarily living and being you know uh being married and everything but 

Recording: (6102/ 9621) 
sure we can do that  

Recording: (6103/ 9621) 
yeah my brother is well he is the oldest oldest but two sisters pretty much all the ones that i really care about two sisters and their husbands

Recording: (6111/ 9621) 
i 

Recording: (6112/ 9621) 
but neither that they are into goes back to uh you know the quality or the corner or anything i mean obviously just poor kid you know apparently was so miserable his life that he was going down the stairs and the basement to you know to figure out some way of uh reaching his neir van or whatever you know and uh and his parents never flew or if they did they did not care you know 

Recording: (6113/ 9621) 
but at the same time it is not like they had the intent to do it so i can not see anything too incredibly severe um but i mean i almost think it should be considered basically child neglect and things like that um basically the same penalty that you run into for that um but i mean they obviously do need to make it more severe because obviously your kids has the opportunity to kill themselves with a gun 

Recording: (6114/ 9621) 
oh yes definitely in england too 

Recording: (6115/ 9621) 
that he did not 

Recording: (6116/ 9621) 
yeah so and a lot of people turn eighteen when they are in high school so i am sure they can go get one there 

Recording: (6117/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (6118/ 9621) 
yes i do uh about i try to visit at least uh at least two every two years we either we go to new york or we meet halfway a couple years ago we met at penn state and uh so you know the older ones are all dying also so 

Recording: (6119/ 9621) 
yeah  

Recording: (6120/ 9621) 
yeah eighty four 

Recording: (6121/ 9621) 
oh it is just so every the environment of course is incredibly beautiful uh and everybody is more uh i think more open or more receptive to relationships to uh you know i think it is a friend much friendly or a place and then i i just think the vibration are higher up there you just do not have poverty well if anybody is in poverty in oregon it is because they have chosen to live a simple life it is not a you know because they can not get jobs and things like that although the economy and oregon it is not that great but you know they say in using that even the dishwasher is to have phd  well the the uh the level of the years of education per capita is probably the highest in the country 

Recording: (6122/ 9621) 
i thought other important roles where would you be where would your mother possibly she went to catholic school i take it where was she been is not going for the nunons why would we put an son is downwhy are we putting on this down hey they work lot less than your money that he is gonna come save for and they have a very important role for your development even though your generation is removed 

Recording: (6123/ 9621) 
yeah yeah  and the funny thing about that is if i heard one of those songs once i might not be that turned off by it  but if you are going to play it at me you know six times in three hours  

Recording: (6124/ 9621) 
i heard something the other day that really really upset me i was at um this convention downtown convention center and uh one of the ladies that was of the beginning one of the work shops is a college professor in english at one of the ohio colleges and she said when she started teaching in nineteen eighty five they would always she teaches writing technical writing for people to do when they get out into the industry world reports and stuff she said they used to say gear your writing to a person who is in the aids grade 

Recording: (6125/ 9621) 
that is great 

Recording: (6126/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6127/ 9621) 
well actually i have picked up a part time job just in the past month or two so i am i am working for research for just for the convenience of the hours i i wanna go back into the nursing field but right now i just can not take that much time away because it would be at least an eight hours shift and uh i do not think that we are ready for that yet he is a teacher uhhuh he works at high school yeah he teaches ninth and tenth graders  i would be deceiving myself i think i i guess when i i hear about them i am just like oh my gosh i can not believe all of the the things that these kids are experiencing i did not know about whatever until i was much much older i did not worry about that when i was that age and it is kind of scary 

Recording: (6128/ 9621) 
and uh and they are not the kind that would go out and just shoot at the animal would be shoot at they would use it to food they would sometimes they i know one time that they gave it to a family that was uh did not have any money and did not have any food they would not kill to somebody in many animals and gave it to them and i do not have a problem with that uh but my brotherinlaw is very much opposed to any kind of gun control he he believes whatever charles h withst in tells it 

Recording: (6129/ 9621) 
i think my grand pago is at church 

Recording: (6130/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (6131/ 9621) 
i mean 

Recording: (6132/ 9621) 
and he troubles all over the state of ohio 

Recording: (6133/ 9621) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (6134/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6135/ 9621) 
and unfortunately uh they did not really prove anything except that they that death is falling on them 

Recording: (6136/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (6137/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6138/ 9621) 
you you why are you doing eight children now 

Recording: (6139/ 9621) 
i think it would probably i i think it would be certainly interesting 

Recording: (6140/ 9621) 
um yes and no like i said i think the average person is pretty decent person i mean i do not think there is anything violent or there is anything wrong with them but at the same time it is just the media of folks that are out of control and makes a big deals of the ones that are out of control and i think that is sort of what people pick up the perception to be i mean they do not they do not show about like when people are helping people out or things like that when the local high schools like volunteering at like the local senior citizens home or something like that 

Recording: (6141/ 9621) 
but i am like it test scores are identical and they had the exact same experience you know objective ways 

Recording: (6142/ 9621) 
because i do not know it just was like if i get pregnant i get pregnant they do not know of what you really have to go through of having a baby you know because i guess i really did not care if if i got pregnant and got pregnant it did not it did not really you know register my mind that this will you know not run but it will it will change your whole life 

Recording: (6143/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (6144/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (6145/ 9621) 
yeah and it just did not work 

Recording: (6146/ 9621) 
it is in northern ohio it is near ill area which is west of cleveland 

Recording: (6147/ 9621) 
that is right with them 

Recording: (6148/ 9621) 
and i know that in my case i use a personal case and i will use frank my older son uh well the ones that i am speaking of are the one the boys going on seventeen the one little girl just turned eleven the other one turned eight well they go over to the one grandparents house and she happened to have it of paying them for a little dog that is over her house so kind of think of only one they come to my house 

Recording: (6149/ 9621) 
and uh the second tornado it was not as bad i mean it was he was driving up after he uh ripped me off and he said well i am taking your sorry out in the back to come on this and i said okay go for it and just sitting here smiling all the way up no knowing way he did not know we get the tennessee in that you know the weather is kind of bad there too and the air man slow down you know you do not have any wind chill wiper in the middle of this rain storm 

Recording: (6150/ 9621) 
girls i have never seen them take a guy out of a bar 

Recording: (6151/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (6152/ 9621) 
um they more or less buy a dog for a token 

Recording: (6153/ 9621) 
well i guess i would have to say i do not necessarily like middle school but see when you get a specialized certificate you are sort of five kindergarten through twelve so i did several years in high school when i was first out of college i did high school first and then i went to elementary while my kids were in elementary so i could kind of keep in touch with what they were supposed to be learning you know and then six years ago i went to the middle school and i have decided that i am too old to give up with these kids not only are they learning disability in eighty d but they are middle schoolers and they have like hormones running rampant all over the outside of their bodies you can not tell which is the is the hormones and which is the cd and which is the learning disability but like i said i only have two more years to go so i guess i can live through that 

Recording: (6154/ 9621) 
i think it is better probably at the do not know i can say anything about it you know and most of the people you know like when you get to i lived in the barroots all the time but i mean you know a lot of people you know they get their own places off base you know and it cares when i say i do not i do not care you know like i say i have a gay i do not care what they doing i mean this they are old enough to do whatever act they are talking to you know 

Recording: (6155/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (6156/ 9621) 
short north in the short north but um it is so much fun it is absolutely so much fun because it is really weird um you normally do not get hit on by girls when you go to a regular dance club but when you go to access you do not get hit on my girls you get head on my guys i dance with low sticks and i have had i had like seven guys come up to the him in one night and they are just like can not you like can you do that for me 

Recording: (6157/ 9621) 
oh we have fun  

Recording: (6158/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6159/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6160/ 9621) 
yeah he wants to teach he is he likes football and he wants to coach football but you have to teach to do that so 

Recording: (6161/ 9621) 
we hear uh and now that the most news worthy story out there so i think uh the press have a lot to do with it the media 

Recording: (6162/ 9621) 
um it is an eatable trip that is all it is basically it is like i can do this 

Recording: (6163/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6164/ 9621) 
oh my gosh it was it was it was just unbelievable he got really sick after that rush week yeah really sick so they wanted to move into the virginia house they can not really afford it but they just sent me a really nice letter saying he is like in the top of their chapter academically and everything so i am thinking they might help them out a little bit they want them in the house real bad 

Recording: (6165/ 9621) 
basically uh it is just the talk and stuff it is not uh like you know what i mean uh i am black i am better i am white i am better it is none of that 

Recording: (6166/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (6167/ 9621) 
gone down hill huh 

Recording: (6168/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (6169/ 9621) 
and it is if you know any teenagers the more strict you make it the more they rebel 

Recording: (6170/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (6171/ 9621) 
i you know from my perspective which is skewed of course to me i think it just seems that way i mean we have we are only talking about ten cases that is not very many you know i mean you could by a coincidence have them all be african american um if i were african american i think i would have a different perspective and i you know i do not do not live in the neighborhood where we see a lot of police so uh you know i just do not i am i am not in touch with it with that situation 

Recording: (6172/ 9621) 
so if he if he you could not bring any any like pets about say if you had a dog could you bring it back to this day so you have to leave all those 

Recording: (6173/ 9621) 
well we we went in out in april 

Recording: (6174/ 9621) 
nope 

Recording: (6175/ 9621) 
oh well we really wants to go he lives in california that is for that family i told you about was he and when he is fourteen or sixteen and he really wants to go back so we will probably end up there sometime but after i finish school and after he works for a little while and i work in so that we have enough money and i mean we do not need to have the ton but we just should be at least a little out of debt you know yeah something 

Recording: (6176/ 9621) 
it is just 

Recording: (6177/ 9621) 
so i am like 

Recording: (6178/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (6179/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (6180/ 9621) 
we have definitely made some progress in that direction i still think that there is considerable progress that needs to be made uh i was just talking to someone a couple of ago who is a fellow history major and her actually her brother is a fellow history major too and a friend of mine i do not know them all that well but uh apparently her family i mean she is she is double major history and chemistry she plans to go to med school her parents her family supports are in this but they have made it painfully clear that when that she should not plan on having a career because then she is going to have to raise children at some point which is uh that is not the way things should work in my belief and and the fact that it is like the male is telling the daughter like this is how things need to be i think i mean you know i think an individual individual should have the choice but i feel i mean i i am concerned about a a uh like this push to the right that is sort of going on hoping it is sort of dying out but i mean it seemed a little scarier back in like ninety four ninety five then uh i think we have reached a point where because not all of the advances have been one hundred percent successful the the opposition is criticize the advance 

Recording: (6181/ 9621) 
but when he did have something to do with them it was kind of strange they would go out and wh is at girls and stuff like that 

Recording: (6182/ 9621) 
yeah the big things 

Recording: (6183/ 9621) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (6184/ 9621) 
yeah pretty much 

Recording: (6185/ 9621) 
the 

Recording: (6186/ 9621) 
well the main thing is they never leave they do not they go a lot of them through their senior year and graduate oh high state has the lowest gpa in any college 

Recording: (6187/ 9621) 
so but it has a really tough challenging jobs and yeah if i knew now what i knew then they could probably could be a millionaire with all the lawsuits of different yeah experiences um sexual harassment 

Recording: (6188/ 9621) 
oh well in oregon well i was down in california for three months in the and uh i went to the produce stand and i took my umbrellain of course it does not rain too much  in california and i said oh i am from oregon and i always think it is going to rain and he says well i am from washington and i know it is going to rain 

Recording: (6189/ 9621) 
so you want to get to meet two more men to play good now you got another leaguelet me ask you question how does that impact you if you can not be a priest are not there other important quote unquote roles for women in the church are not there other important roles 

Recording: (6190/ 9621) 
on the spur of the moment i would have to think about that i really would 

Recording: (6191/ 9621) 
 i 

Recording: (6192/ 9621) 
it is like hitting me and i just am not sure you can tell me if it is not anywhere near my mouth 

Recording: (6193/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6194/ 9621) 
yeah i i want to have them on do it  

Recording: (6195/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6196/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6197/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6198/ 9621) 
do not like it huh 

Recording: (6199/ 9621) 
like you are doing interviewsies 

Recording: (6200/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (6201/ 9621) 
right right right 

Recording: (6202/ 9621) 
yeah and you know did not uh show that song you kind of just thought you know like uh you know i am i am proved to them that you know they can not push me around 

Recording: (6203/ 9621) 
but northly noise is where i do think uh shopping 

Recording: (6204/ 9621) 
 what the hell am i doing here  

Recording: (6205/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (6206/ 9621) 
i think i would say the same thing because uh course we had the benefit of having a mother who was very giving i mean i think i learned a lot from her self lessness and uh 

Recording: (6207/ 9621) 
ways said 

Recording: (6208/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6209/ 9621) 
in what way 

Recording: (6210/ 9621) 
no what what really um when aids started i had a a one of my best friends a brother had died of it and that and that really after that i like till you know was like i have to work on them because i was scared to death so they get aids you know so i did work on them you know probably after a few years of having sixes out comes but 

Recording: (6211/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (6212/ 9621) 
i have been playing a video game since i was two so 

Recording: (6213/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (6214/ 9621) 
um it is magnified and and worth yeah they have that choice they can they will listen and you do not understand and by all in i know i have tried that but the best i can do now is trying and advocate for myself in terms of listening uh i hear what you are saying but i am trying to show you that uh and tell you how i work best so as long as you can try not to dictate to me and allow me some freedom and give me goals of what you want to accomplish and give me the freedom to accomplish and the way that i can do it uh not by quotas and dead lines and crap like that uh i can show you what to do and that is that is a struggle map right now trying to find employment where people companies them slack you know and i wanted to do some driving but you know uh because at least down on the road you know i do not to put up with anyone is crap but long distances is it is not good for me focusing concentrate uh and i i have had you know several accidents several tickets um so i mean i have even had uh you know two other heading toys 

Recording: (6215/ 9621) 
oh that is true 

Recording: (6216/ 9621) 
but i can certainly i can certainly see that not to i think that you know a lot of a lot of people feel like too he he he is one of us you know he is like he is like the way our kind of thing well michigan it is a t and your mandatory jail it is not gonna be any good call within you okay at all 

Recording: (6217/ 9621) 
and  that is pretty much the way i felt the whole day because those just smile them on the inside 

Recording: (6218/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (6219/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6220/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (6221/ 9621) 
and the battle at fall in timber here is my rough draft would you fix it for me before i make my final copy so i will get a good grade yeah i tell them i said that is what i am here for you know i am here to help you use me to help you get better grades use me to run into our science if you think you know the science but you are getting marked down because you can not spell the words let me know i will go talk to your science teacher tell her how to count your spelling or not you know not to make you take the test without the little spelled check or thing that is in your book bag the let you use that i mean i do a lot of um what i call educating for my kids with the regular ed teachers that do not understand i go in and i say well you know this is kind of a long test could he maybe take half day and half tomorrow or would you mind if he came out to my room ninth period during study hall because i have a free period and i could like kind of monitor it and and read the words he does not know so that he is actually answering what the question really says instead of what he thinks it says so that you will not be testing his reading ability but you will really be testing whether he knows about magnetism 

Recording: (6222/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (6223/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6224/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (6225/ 9621)

Recording: (6228/ 9621) 
they get them to do what they do to even to help like mind people or to uh help people that have other physical disabilities um you you can tell from the way the dog is in terms of uh with with the way the dog behaviors with the person that has the disability uh that they have been trained for um you can tell whether they have been trained or trained the right way or whatever so i thought about that but you know uh uh you know i have not given much more than you know just the thought but you know looked at the veterans area system and i went in there and it was not uh you know i was there just for a half a day and you know they were telling me about some of these people out there that uh you know i do not understand the law again but you know there is people out there that will go out and they will buy a dog you know nice dog and uh because they do not wanna make the time to train it and spend the time with it because they take a lot of time in discipline and love and care just like a child 

Recording: (6229/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (6230/ 9621) 
yeah course you know babies tend not to be on on time

oh there always has been there always has been i think a lot of people feel that kids a lot of kids are on medication today that should not be but uh i think that is the fault of the school or the parents or some doctor that like for example when we refer kids in arlington to a doctor we have a list of three doctors that we work with and we know is that they will not just give this kid a pill if he does not have eight out of the twelve systems or whatever so we refer them to those doctors and then if this doctor is those doctors are pretty conservative too and if they put them on meds it is usually just for the school day not during the summer and not over vacation not after five oclock not on the weekends and it is just to help them focus and then these doctors also ask for reports back from the teachers and if you do not see any maerable difference in two or three weeks then you take the kid off and you try something out and some kids the medication is like the difference between night and day you go back and observe the kid you can not believe it the same kid other kids might not be doing kind of glass of water well since they have side effects like they stunch their gross and they subdo your appetite and some of the other you know some kids get headache from getcadrein and that or all so i say you know if it works use it if it if it does not work just forget it but you know a lot of people feel that too many kids are on this stuff because they are maybe just not able to pay attention a little bit but they are not really eighty and the parents are taking them in and going johnny is not getting straight a way he is putting one something  so i guess

Recording: (6268/ 9621) 
i like it um i have lived i have only lived in the northern end i have lived in dublin and old worthinton and now how weird which is kind of around the side um but i like it because it has its own own little well especially worth into its own little city within the city

Recording: (6272/ 9621) 
not going to work 

Recording: (6273/ 9621) 
yeah probably because we have some public systems most of them are for the librarian but there is some for public too 

Recording: (6274/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (6275/ 9621) 
i think when you have two and three pets you have to make a little bit more effort 

Recording: (6276/ 9621) 
yeah it was pretty much up from middle class 

Recording: (6277/ 9621) 
i wonder if that is also a socialized medicine there it is socialized is not it 

Recording: (6278/ 9621) 
which was the going thing 

Recording: (6279/ 9621) 
um i have a class at um high school that it is called bread and it is like um you know all the kids in there are people that have kids 

Recording: (6280/ 9621) 
i have got nothing against christianity but i got something against the way it was brought here 

Recording: (6281/ 9621) 
yeah exactly 

Recording: (6282/ 9621) 
well they needed to strike do not get me wrong that is not the stupid part but the part was uh the majority of them saying that they were here for ten years and they made that much money most people would move on 

Recording: (6283/ 9621) 
yeah well the white man would probably win but the black man also has a he has a better chance than the woman i would think 

Recording: (6284/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6285/ 9621) 
that 

Recording: (6286/ 9621) 
you know what um actually i do not believe they have anything book so far a lot of times i think this year people are more going out rather than having people come into their homes and things i have usually i have worked for different hotels where i have always worked on new year is eve and my husband this year is like you know but we do not even have any plans we were gonna be able to do something with some friends when they are going to california so i am not sure even exactly what i am going to do but uh right now there is not an even events scheduled 

Recording: (6287/ 9621) 
no really i mean different cultures and everything uh uh i i went to school with blacks so i mean that was not that big a thing except for the in plus of the you know i live in the real age how many were being drafted or being in listening to the service at the time and everything or how many actually were even in the in the country you know 

Recording: (6288/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (6289/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6290/ 9621) 
and i mean yes they find the cause of it whatever you know that is good but at the same time the the cause of it does not really matter i mean the fact of the matter is it is there they have to deal with it so 

Recording: (6291/ 9621) 
um media has a lot of control over people but i believe that sometimes people just need a kick like that 

Recording: (6292/ 9621) 
they did 

Recording: (6293/ 9621) 
see the thing is i think that down payment has to be ten percent down and so that means that i would have that tied up while it was being rented like we bought a couple condos over on bevelled road for my kids to live in so to my oldest girl when she was getting ready to move out she was like twenty four and they could not find any place to live that i thought was that that i felt was safe and that was acceptable so i finally decided well we will find something and i will buy it and i will be your land lady and then the boy it will it will be nice and so i bought that one and then my other daughter wanted to was thinking she was going to move out when she graduated from high school and changed her mind so i just rented that one but it the bond line is i i just got a second mortgage and i have a guy that i work with that helped me buy those without any money i did not have a down payment i had nothing so so it is like i could rent and come out even with 

Recording: (6294/ 9621) 
you know i just got out of it 

Recording: (6295/ 9621) 
yeah and and immigration from different countries and those people come in and they have got their input and i think that it is just a mixture of everything 

Recording: (6296/ 9621) 
and do not insulted us anymore or we will go to trial uh some of my attorney jumped the back up to a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars i could not take sitting there these guys going back and forth of what they thought i was worth even our are which way that system works 

Recording: (6297/ 9621) 
okay uh my name is i uh am an undergrad double major in germany in history currently working on a senior honors thesis in history i will be graduating next quarter to a grand total of six years is an undergrad and impressive uh somewhat disturbing six years is an undergrad uh i live like it here uh i think if it is a big city having been to other big cities it feels more like that than small towns which fall so been to of course and 

Recording: (6298/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6299/ 9621) 
and there are no computer manuals for it so you have to figure it out totally on your own i do not think you are going to get into that 

Recording: (6300/ 9621) 
umhum yeah i am just learning the area so but i like it so far it seems really nice and uh it seems like there is a lot more to do upon this obviously but 

Recording: (6301/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (6302/ 9621) 
biz him 

Recording: (6303/ 9621) 
there is just too much diversity 

Recording: (6304/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (6305/ 9621) 
well i lived on twelve maybe about four or five years ago probably longer but that was just for a summer thing you know after i saw the couch being burned as such a  

Recording: (6306/ 9621) 
that was a lot of old pinkie 

Recording: (6307/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6308/ 9621) 
 i have seen this a thousand times now people fighting killing this murder that murder it is like the same thing they over and over and over we just keep repeating and repeating our bad stuff instead of getting off of us 

Recording: (6309/ 9621) 
thirty nine 

Recording: (6310/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (6311/ 9621) 
um the first year they made it in state only um second the second class they are going to be starting to house some people from michigan i think 

Recording: (6312/ 9621) 
i mean he was a funny guy he was a really nice guy but it took them a while to catch on to things 

Recording: (6313/ 9621) 
i remember it being it is a pretty positive thing for me i was never upset about the fact that they were not together because they all supposed gave me a lot of attention but um about i think i was maybe five or six my mom went to an apartment in german village 

Recording: (6314/ 9621) 
like i know it is like it is it is really serious and it is really not serious like it is it is everything i guess 

Recording: (6315/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (6316/ 9621) 
um so i think that part definitely helps where as much to my other friends you know they are kind of lost they do not know exactly what they are doing um where like i said i have already done all this stuff that we are doing now and know how to go about it and 

Recording: (6317/ 9621) 
well that is good that is good 

Recording: (6318/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (6319/ 9621) 
yeah i have a brother and two sisters 

Recording: (6320/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (6321/ 9621) 
i will buy herself 

Recording: (6322/ 9621) 
a little bit faster uh but then in then when i get out of the service i get twenty two you know that is kind of like behind everybody you know as far as my age group and stuff that did not have to go and uh so i had had a lot of uh good times as far as that goes and you know cleanliness and they are just golly and this and all that stuff you know i mean a lot of people do not there is just a lot of lack stuff goes on today in my opinion but 

Recording: (6323/ 9621) 
like you means actual relationships and what um probably the the bad things about it yeah um but just come in from like christian beliefs and what not the best thing and i know it even though i did not partake in it when i was a teenager and i was not promiscuous at all but i still had sex before marriage uh just to be it would be nice if they teach you how to be confident yourself and i do not mean like selfesteem but you know like we said if if uh you know you come from a situation like that that does not mean you have to be like that do you know what i mean kind of 

Recording: (6324/ 9621) 
and uh i said our our engineers the engineers per se but they are techies uh are really into this they they enjoy their work and it is a poor it is in the forefront front of the ohio government along with the technology there has to always be the paperwork and i know realize we have a paperless environment quote unquote 

Recording: (6325/ 9621) 
um i was in the more mean yeah it it is not so touristy and they they have a thing where you could not have any buildings bigger than the state capitol because they did not want it to be like orlando or miami like miami especially so it was really interesting it was a different type of town like not not so many palm trees more big oak trees and stuff like that yeah it is real it is more not all of us centralized downtown it is more of a like it is pretty now 

Recording: (6326/ 9621) 
even my mother who is uh she said if rick somewhere run it and they she would vote for them she is that much of a conservative uh agree with what is happened but most people will say the same thing there should have been another way to get them out of there but at this point i do not think there really was a a few months ago you know but 

Recording: (6327/ 9621) 
i am not sure i do not know his his dad found it and pulled me about it because i was not working at the time and we were trying to get an extra income to come in and um his dad made actually like twenty five dollars or something you know i would think he would make more than that because man every time we go over the visa up on the computer something and so and i am on there you know just i look at baby stuff get coupons and stuff um you know like reading about things that happen to people like their kids getting up in their face or something 

Recording: (6328/ 9621) 
and ones you like them to see that you do not like 

Recording: (6329/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (6330/ 9621) 
i do not know i saw it in the paper some kid was suspended because he had a paper he would do a picture of a gun and cut it out 

Recording: (6331/ 9621) 
it is just out of control i mean like i said i mean that is sort of kids for you i mean they just obviously they can be curious about things and the parent definitely does have to be held responsible for it but i do not know to what degree that they should go with it 

Recording: (6332/ 9621) 
i mean if i would have chosen to do that well that is my choiceyou and your husband it is like what are you people of questions because he was notist and he chose to jane catholic when we got married and had perception of the methodist religion and the catholic religion and the more i was exposed to his was like boy boy these really are similar but yours is a lot looser than mine and you know who is you know um just teaching him to be honest and open and being able to talk about sex and drugs and being there and open and keeping the lines of communication open and then it goes back to the family being available and doing meaningful things with the children 

Recording: (6333/ 9621) 
umhum okay 

Recording: (6334/ 9621) 
you can not see it in a day 

Recording: (6335/ 9621) 
or anything like that i do smack his hands 

Recording: (6336/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6337/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6338/ 9621) 
yeah but you put up with that anywhere it is not just a hot day to be anywhere you go you know it is just like i said you get excuse me you get ass holes in 

Recording: (6339/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6340/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (6341/ 9621) 
i do not know about that yeah he has not shown that period yet i do not know if he is supposed to be showing it now or not because um i mean when he gets to the an a news you know by and long you know  look up okay by  

Recording: (6342/ 9621) 
she is doing all right as far as i know she is going to saint louis university you know they are going to ask me why but 

Recording: (6343/ 9621) 
 but um um one time i i read somewhere that a a mexican lady who came across the border to have her baby and they put the little band on and they wrote female and then they wrote her last name she said to her husband when he came over to see her well they have already named her look from molly 

Recording: (6344/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (6345/ 9621) 
well unfortunately i do not think it is fair but i think in the long run it does not have to be a college education because most of this people probably would not want a college education uh but like a trade or a skill or something that will give them a little bit of hope if they do want to choose to get a job instead of robbing to bank or selling drugs or whatever they did they have that choice it is it is it is up on their head okay i can either go become a welder or i can have a gun i mean if they want a college education um yeah it is it is not fair but for for you growing up and going into a lifestyle i would prefer having their colleges paid for and then being productive citizens than somebody robbing me some day because they did not get an education i mean you know that is a broad spectrum and i know it is not all that could not drive um yeah that would upset me but hopefully i would step back from it a little bit and go well maybe it is for the bestyeah 

Recording: (6346/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6347/ 9621) 
uh well i paid for one thing when i was overseas if we wanted to do something we would wait till the sarge went in the shed and we would just put a padlock on the door so he could not get out 

Recording: (6348/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (6349/ 9621) 
umhum umhum 

Recording: (6350/ 9621) 
umhum yeah yeah it is been glamorousized and they do not they do not value human life either i do not think because there is so much violence you know you can not watch tv and that is seeing somebody gets shot or something and it is just like it is not really real because it is you know you can turn the channel and then you see the same actor doing something out with you and it looks at you know it was not real and i do not think they i i do not know 

Recording: (6351/ 9621) 
yeah and it it has the least amount of people which is kind of neat as far as tourism so 

Recording: (6352/ 9621) 
yeah they like they really like this town she was from kentucky appalachia 

Recording: (6353/ 9621) 
no i do not go to mass every day but i go on sunday 

Recording: (6354/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6355/ 9621) 
um no english 

Recording: (6356/ 9621) 
but when you can not go much of anything on it it is 

Recording: (6357/ 9621) 
no not really i mean i would have preferred it of course and i would prefer that she carried on the faith the same as the rest of the children did but now i am i am very happy and content with her decisionin unhers she and her husband bothed they have both their children in a catholic prep school and yeah kindergarten in preschool and it is uh yes it is a catholic school environment so it will be interesting to see what evolve from the children is uh attention to the the roman catholic side of religion is compared to theed so 

Recording: (6358/ 9621) 
 yeah 

Recording: (6359/ 9621) 
oh wow 

Recording: (6360/ 9621) 
this is the game we play every weekend too and it is uh okay game um monday night i usually come up with something to on the news 

Recording: (6361/ 9621) 
we send them in and then the kids now see the age because see the age because you take them in march and then we get the pay the scores back in may sometime and um some of my kids well i have a group of kids that i had them when they were six graders and they just now graduated 

Recording: (6362/ 9621) 
i really hate that um and like from an action and stuff totally burns me up the idea is wonderful but it is it is just executed very poorly i mean i saw like from high school how easy it was from me to get into places i mean instead of do not want the bagging need to come 

Recording: (6363/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (6364/ 9621) 
oh yeah it is huge 

Recording: (6365/ 9621) 
well when i was growing up there was not that much violence and i could go and in and i have done it now my name in on this report so you can not do nothing about 

Recording: (6366/ 9621) 
like thatyeah 

Recording: (6367/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (6368/ 9621) 
why would you only you said you were at third of the third why would you only leave the third one i would be in i would not want this this country has our problems it is just like my family has our problems why would i really do not problem lead a family why we would need the country why not work with it correct it because whenever i am away from it you know i am doing i am running into another chaos at the other end someone has come the other direction and they have not resolved things and that is what is happening on society we have not sit down to learn and understand one anotheroh 

Recording: (6369/ 9621) 
ah that would like awesome 

Recording: (6370/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (6371/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (6372/ 9621) 
just different stuff it is different every day that is why i like it just like with utah and people it is different every day 

Recording: (6373/ 9621) 
that is pretty extreme 

Recording: (6374/ 9621) 
but it takes to 

Recording: (6375/ 9621) 
three years 

Recording: (6376/ 9621) 
it is available it is just whether they go and put forth the effort 

Recording: (6377/ 9621) 
and so uh soon as my shop found out that i could draw that or ninety dollars a month 

Recording: (6378/ 9621) 
was not it hard 

Recording: (6379/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (6380/ 9621) 
and i was born in new york 

Recording: (6381/ 9621) 
and i am saying i could take that route but it would cost me a lot of money that i do not have to get the legal defense and it would be just best for me to take the responsibility like i have and i sold the car that i had to my sister uh i am going to pay back the apartment complex that i signed at least for uh and i am going to make them come after me you know come you know uh i already went to court once and and uh even well even with the evidence being in my favor i mean i was only at this place three months i did not do any damage to it um and the walls did not need paint it i was not there long enough to make them dirty uh but um their own person even went through on the first run after i moved out and my mother and i clean that thing up i was top bottom bathrooms and wash the floors and my first run after i moved out and my mother and i clean that thing up the floori clean out things spot myself the rated the paint in the a which meant according to their system a meant no 

Recording: (6382/ 9621) 
those are the former right of yours of a child 

Recording: (6383/ 9621) 
i think it has changed drastically and i think it is changing and i think it will also be changing in the future uh going all the way back uh finances of we are we are not a consideration in the in oh i would say probably my first thirty maybe forty years there was some that was involved but i think the influence was not financial it was influenced from the person who could get up here and talk with a group of people and sway them with his and i want to use the word opinion that i know that is not right it he swayed them with a position that he had developed now that is not necessarily his opinion so i am trying to make a point there  he would sway them basically upon the influents that he had had from uh uh various people within his community or whether whether you are talking about a town ship or a county state whatever it may be and yes uh uh then per slowly then i think the finances came into play and finances have come to a horrible horrible situation as of the day and i will live out this the the last two years it had because it is because it is rather specific right now but going back to two years or four years ago finances were still a very very heavy consideration and not not just on the uh national level but i am saying even on local levels i know within the immediate community there are people out there uh or hey come on we will go to dinner we will do this and we will do this and do this just just barely barely breaking uh the barrier but not breaking the law uh so guess very definitely progressively has changed 

Recording: (6384/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6385/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (6386/ 9621) 
i i do not think anyone really effected anyone too too much as far as that goes 

Recording: (6387/ 9621) 
in the strange city i know oh my god 

Recording: (6388/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (6389/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (6390/ 9621) 
oh yeah oh yeah i used to be when i first started teaching even up to sixth grade kids were pretty respectful 

Recording: (6391/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (6392/ 9621) 
yeah they okay their parents they are in their seventies now  i i take what i need and leave them rest because they have got their own opinions that are a lot different than mine so 

Recording: (6393/ 9621) 
you know they do not understand the concept so they do not know any different of you know why did not we get to stay home they may later when they grow older but yeah but i still think you know they benefited a lot from it now 

Recording: (6394/ 9621) 
i ever would have before 

Recording: (6395/ 9621) 
you know and what is the point of staying married and being miserable i think it is better to get a divorce than 

Recording: (6396/ 9621) 
family experiences 

Recording: (6397/ 9621) 
yeah i mean i want to see how the season ends out it is just a lot of the ones this season to me have just been disappointing that i mean i think every show is sort of has a peak some shows peak towards the end some at the beginning and sort of level off i mean the the simpsons had a stretch from like their third year through like their seventh where things were just like unbelievable funny and then they had some writing changes i think and this this season it is just it is been completely outrageous story lines and the jokes are not as integrated into the story 

Recording: (6398/ 9621) 
like it i did not feel something to mind 

Recording: (6399/ 9621) 
well they are now in a sense uh it is easier to go somewhere else i think in the way up on tv if you have you know the four news the four local news channels and they are all seeing the same thing and exercising the same things there is no choice there if you want the news you are going to get it one way or the other but on the web you can come somewhere else uh in you know major newspapers or all over the web uh you have been picking choose and you can see different perspective on the same story from different parts of the country and i think you get a a wider view 

Recording: (6400/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (6401/ 9621) 
right  

Recording: (6402/ 9621) 
years ago there was a citizen i do not know if you ever in you or what you background is where you were it was here but you are not but citizen journal was the daily paper and it was it was the opposite of the respect was much more liberal they used this it it was a morning paper and then this past was an afternoon paper evening paper and uh they shared the same facilities the same pretty many pressing and everything and then to spatch one of their lease experimented one and three new at least 

Recording: (6403/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6404/ 9621)

Recording: (6405/ 9621) 
 i am telling you man it would not cut me slack for nothing 

Recording: (6406/ 9621) 
yeah i know well the disney goes up them but such a shame 

Recording: (6407/ 9621) 
i do not i do not think they should i do not have any i do not you know people are okay or you know that is their business but i do not think they that is not that is not how this world wasyou know maybe that is a hard um topic for me to talk about because um i do not know because i am sure there are gay boys that are not known what is going on with themselves that are in school and and i i have never really understood i do not know i never really understood if they were born like that or i i am just never really understood that to tell you the truth  so i would not you know i was just uh if i was a teacher i would just talk to talk to them and you know tell them to do whatever they feel i mean if they feel comfortable if they feel like that that is fine but i do not know i i do not know if i would talk about the but maybe they should because there might be kids in school that are like that and they are like well what should i do  

Recording: (6408/ 9621) 
right umhum 

Recording: (6409/ 9621)

Recording: (6432/ 9621) 
uh my opinion changes from day to day on who is well actually at this point in time i do not know who is fault it is uh i think it is the fault of evolution  well it could have been offended but we did not well i could not have been offended but we did not know it was going to happen that uh that our society was going to change so intensely and we kind of hung back and thought things would stay the same way they were and they have not and everybody is changing and especially the younger people and uh we were not ready and we did not change fast enough  we did not get ready for the change that was coming 

Recording: (6433/ 9621) 
i talk to all my family my brother is sisters every day 

Recording: (6434/ 9621) 
back to bad  

Recording: (6435/ 9621) 
not specifically no i sometimes um little groups of if there is a college in a community when i was running a school levy campaign um we would try to get them either registered and and active in a campaign um but it was very difficult it was sort of like getting people who live in a trailer park active in voting and there is certain little blocks of people uh and on school levy is the people who voted no which for senior citizens i mean they they went to the polls and droves you did not have to you know the the hope there was that they would not go to vote  on the school every oh they are actually trying to get college kids involved i have not really specifically done that as a whole campaign in and of itself it might be a little pocket of a campaign but nothing big 

Recording: (6436/ 9621) 
no no they did not uh they did not pay for grading or preparing your classes or or searching anything  so right but but still even though it was a real a very much underpaid job i i liked it when i did it uh i liked the introduction to the arts class because i had to develop my own curriculum for it  right they had a when they told me i i they would hire me to teach this class they gave me a book that was about this stick and it was only about painting 

Recording: (6437/ 9621) 
a lot of pool actually uh we go to a bar called the other end because it is cheap and it is fun though 

Recording: (6438/ 9621) 
and uh and then i say we went to church fairly regularly but to tell you the truth they can not remember too much that i was talking to them but  but i was exposed to it anyway and i i am sure that some of them rub off on me 

Recording: (6439/ 9621) 
i know 

Recording: (6440/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6441/ 9621) 
yeah um 

Recording: (6442/ 9621) 
and they uh actually offered an early retirement because the funds i do not know you may not remember about three years ago four years ago the federal government was not going to pass a budget and all the stuff so when that does not happen on budget and a good unfortunately cuts in it seventy five percent of what the previous year of budget was or something like that which is actually more money than they were going to give us before than it uh so they had to they would have to layoff people or offer retirement so i took the retirement because i was not happy there anyway so then took a couple months off and did some consulting was worked on the consulting project at a board once for about six months and then when that project ended just same time and then my fatherinlaw was dianis terminally over cancer and he needed daily treatments here in columbus and they do not they were from shawkopf so uh i became his care giver for about three months too he died and then took a couple months off and started working part time at the symphony have been since then

my my thing is you still you you try to your best on earth do the atch bit you have whether they are supposed to be a missionary fine can you see a missionary working in the office there is an informationary working in the office around this on the campus every day they are talking about diversity here all you got to do is just sit down you have always done numbers game you have done numbers you know just learn about one another and you have going to find out you know what i think they said the the clear black line society uh that is probably the idea of the problem when you are in a coma but when you are let us say you are out you can not see anything you need to do the surgery on you are you going to be you are going to qualify well i want this surgery to be this and that and then that 

Recording: (6451/ 9621) 
so it is kind of hard you know what i mean to to do a lot of things 

Recording: (6452/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (6453/ 9621) 
in fact the man i can not say that 

Recording: (6454/ 9621) 
yeah and everybody has it right 

Recording: (6455/ 9621) 
oh i taken this good up perfect 

Recording: (6456/ 9621) 
right but still my my oldest dog was for a long time she was in in theater and people seemed how do you feel about that and i said what do you know i feel about that you know she can always wait tables as long as she gets up the port herself to what do i care and then she ended up getting undergraduate degree in psychology and now as it turns out she is going to um she just started back she is once having the baby though she just started back and uh to get certified to teach them in to school because we have talked so much about what where would she do well and she she would just do so well she is really good but she is such a kid herself she is really good with with kids maybe second third grade she is so into animals and so into science and understand different kids so that you know i i think she would be fabulous there and so she is kind of decided but if that if she ends up not doing that to more care either 

Recording: (6457/ 9621) 
the yeah 

Recording: (6458/ 9621) 
yeah your you yeah you may be right could be could be

Recording: (6460/ 9621) 
i think they try to to bring the layman end to more of the the duties of the priesties of the priest but there is like the concentration of the bread line that that none of that has been sanctions they do not perform they do not uh uh they are not able to give the sacramentoal gracees for back to those holy and well they do holy community but uh extra function metric and none of those i have been dedicated outside of the duties of the pretty but uh i still think that it is a good i do think the involvement of the layman is very important but i do not have any i i mean that does not bother me a bit about women 

Recording: (6461/ 9621) 
if if we ran to score sports i mean the game of sports not the most at least the administration of sports is just as unethical as a business world it is unethical and it is one of the biggest problems we have in our society because we have emphasized sports along with a theater as being oh the way to go and the the poor the poor spinch makes you could have in terms of financial uh uh appreciation sure you the thing is you market demands the uh dollar that type of thing well you i am going to do it but the thing is it gets almost beautiful like a lawsuit case we are crazy in seeing people again gets back to question why the hell are you coming to asking for thirty million dollars let me ask you let me ask you question why the hell are you coming to asking for thirty million dollars do not you ever think you are on coots 

Recording: (6462/ 9621)

Recording: (6467/ 9621) 
so that is like a big thing you know they are saying we are north on shopping center close down all the if you go up where i am at they got so many of them spread them all back you are talking about which stores out of them 

Recording: (6468/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6469/ 9621) 
yeah that is i mean that is really a tough one uh because it it i think people are looking for easy answers and there is no easy answer uh and you know i do not think it is violence on tv i do not think it is working parents i think it is i do not i do not know what it is it seems to be something more pervasive than could be so easily uh i i i do not know it is a tough and then i mean you i mean your daughter is his daughter is you know is still young so you had to deal with them but they are scary you send your kids to school and you hear these things and it is just no matter where it is in the country or the world you hear of it you know it is really bothers you 

Recording: (6470/ 9621) 
um freshman sophomore a year yes after that i quit wrestling and i just kind of found myself being myself instead of trying to be someone else sports is definitely part of a click you try to be part of the team and the team tries to do everything the same 

Recording: (6471/ 9621) 
oh the japanese come to 

Recording: (6472/ 9621)

yeah i do not do a whole lot of it but i like to travel 

Recording: (6479/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6480/ 9621) 
yeah uh the second thing would be uh the uh cultural activities that we have um i am back to the center would be one of my primary ones because there is so much going on down there but the art museum and um uh oh right that cultural arts center and columbus music hall i mean there is just a million things 

Recording: (6481/ 9621) 
oh sure you wanna talk about it you know umhum umhum umhumeverything had grape upon ah it is fantastic  the way backwards okayyeah  do do do the do the thump the the thump where did you go from like did you wanna have to even pay it off to have it in the air and then it would not be right to and then some of these new year they can not start even paying off theshe is size really rushed uhhuhuhhuh reallyah you know even when you are there is a lot of them over there uh incidentally the big huge back yard for people like that but there is a lot of other neat putt going onwhy is that just because of the wall  took down the wall the brain and forgets or something like that okay i remember hearing thatuhhuh  uhhuh 

Recording: (6482/ 9621) 
yeah she would been in class 

Recording: (6483/ 9621) 
just i think it is a a deter fla that that um beliefs that we are trying to carry in and because i think if someone showed up and looking like i mean i am not saying that it is terrible but if they have like a nose ring and all this stuff then if somebody might not believe that they have anything creditable to say and a lot of times if you are dressed more respectfully that to you know i mean most of the people will accept you if you are dressed in a dress where as i mean even a person that knows wrong will talk will respect you but but then you are in a you are right over the advantage if you do not  dressing in a certain way 

Recording: (6484/ 9621) 
right  

Recording: (6485/ 9621) 
but the more time i had off it 

Recording: (6486/ 9621)

Recording: (6487/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (6488/ 9621) 
they they definitely struggle they they do i i think to be that high up obviously you are going to come in kind of saying we are for people i have ridged people and things like that but i think at least even if the democrats do have that same thing they seem to keep more in mind that i do not i do not think they represent working class you know guy either but at least more so than they are  so like i said best out of a bad bunch i would probably 

Recording: (6489/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6490/ 9621) 
 you should be real attentive to what is happening in his school situation his or her 

Recording: (6491/ 9621) 
so she is and hopefully they will get married soon they have been together for over a year and a half 

Recording: (6492/ 9621)

Recording: (6494/ 9621) 
and neither one of these folks could answer yes or they are going to answer yes or no that is how i think i stayed from my point very clearly when i was in the answers yes or was it was it was um health care for live in partners um it is a simple question yes i do not know how do you stand on this issue and it just drives me nuts that you know and i know that that from a pr is standpoint you do not want to you do not want to be on any people away that made vote for you because you feel like the they meant you know if you are running for office you should just just be up front 

Recording: (6495/ 9621) 
i am not saying that it is not right for some people but you know it was not right for my son 

Recording: (6496/ 9621) 
oh they do like what 

Recording: (6497/ 9621)

Recording: (6498/ 9621) 
too much 

Recording: (6499/ 9621) 
 it really is great 

Recording: (6500/ 9621) 
i know 

Recording: (6501/ 9621) 
and i looked at it and i thought introduction to be arts to me means something a lot more than that so i ended up coming up with a class that was it was in only nine weeks two it was only nine classes um so it was about a two and a half or three hour class each week for nine weeks and uh i ended up coming up with a curriculum where for the first three weeks we talked about painting mostly in uh visual art and for the second three weeks we talked about music and uh uh development of music various aspects and for the last three weeks we talked about theater actually for the two or the last three weeks we talked about theater and for the last week we talked about musical theater and opera  so for a lot of these kids you know from there was an introduction to uh it was an introduction to a lot of things that they made and they might not have been exposed to  yeah 

Recording: (6502/ 9621) 
uh out her end is over i do not even know they 

Recording: (6503/ 9621) 
oh i see yeah 

Recording: (6504/ 9621) 
but i am using means example because i have seen a lot of other people do the same thing do not get me wrong 

Recording: (6505/ 9621) 
i think that the 

Recording: (6506/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (6507/ 9621) 
beautiful and we like going to see the ski resort and anything i do not really ski 

Recording: (6508/ 9621) 
the catholic schools 

Recording: (6509/ 9621) 
well i yeah but let us face it people that have they are real good guns they are the people that should not have the guns meaning crime and whatnot um i do not have a problem with people having guns but we do not need sixty guns per person or whatever the ratio is it something on godly like that and they keep making them and i i mean yeah there was a time it was a part of our culture we did not need to hunt to eat uh i have friends that bow and arrow hunt i am not real big into hunting but at least they are they have to do something besides sit there and  

Recording: (6510/ 9621) 
my husband lived in a town a small town in southern ohio where the dennison town where three brothers and they were named paying paying and paying dennis and that was spelledpa i n that was some funny name stories out there boy but people just go nuts with their kid is names i just like what you wanna  why could you do that to that kid carol harold  

Recording: (6511/ 9621) 
what 

Recording: (6512/ 9621) 
where are uh where are you from you say 

Recording: (6513/ 9621) 
i said yep i said you you caught mommy singing the bad word and you would got to open them up yep so i go in the bathroom now what i always used to always tell the kids was stick her tongue out and i just a little bit of soaping into her tongue well now i have been i had fallsheets and the kid did this and she do not run about five years so going to the bathroom and i sit down on that toilet too when i sit there i still got my tongue she takes that cage so she does not rub my tongue she is twisted it it got on my piece and it took me almost two two weeks to get that soap taste off my tape no matter how i scrub needless to say if i am going to get in patient after that and i am ready to say something i am looking around to see it 

Recording: (6514/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (6515/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (6516/ 9621) 
ah okay okay it is probably growing up uh and i do not i have been there done that too but still you have got to you have to um notice respect out there to be warranted and you expect it and not just demand it you got to you have to work to show respect and then you should get respect for it but then they saw the interaction with the required the teachers i often ask the teachers i have gone to sporting events and their teachers are there ticket takers uh monitoring a crowd where the kids uh ask and i said do you guys ever go home no no we ask them but they are always there they are not they are just teaching a class they are not there preparing the class they are there after the class they are there for the student and they make the student feel part of the family that is a continuation of my philosophy at home we interact the school is great you have people that are on the clock whoop trying to quit they are gone those people do not know the meaning of life they will never know the meaning of life but they will never know the meaning of life but they will never know the meaning of life but they will never know the meaning of life but they will never know the meaning of life but they will never know the meeting of life but they will never but they will never but they will not really do not really know the meeting the meeting of life they will never know the meaning of life but if they stay around try to extend themselves a little more with somebody that is having problems at work and are willing to work with that person i say willing to work not knowing they are going to be compensated because they will be compensated let me say materialistically they will be more then or more then expected they will be back really coming here somewhere but the thing is just laying in the open hand not knowing well gee what is for what is in it for me what is in it for you is intangible are you willing 

Recording: (6517/ 9621) 
i never thought of that 

Recording: (6518/ 9621) 
but i think kids in high school and stuff some of them like my brotherinlaw is day and when i met him i knew he was like you know he was the type some of them you can not tell them well it does not matter what they look like um but my husband said all through growing up i just did not know know anybody that was uh but you know he was opened thegates his mother right from the beginning and she was from germany which made it little talk because you know they did not talk about that that those things over there at all for a long time but um then she became very open with them and then everybody knew knew and that was in the eighties and you know it is some kids know it when they are young and growing up you know i do not know if it is best to not stay at or to you know be open but if they are open to their parents about it then their parents are gonna deal with it a lot better than than if they wait later on in their life you know but some of them sometimes i guess they change you know most of the men i knew right off the bat you know i mean it was it and it was all through their life it was not it so they just said oh i am going i am going to be gave 

Recording: (6519/ 9621) 
really weird is where i live at i do not even right by right i do not even have city warranty anymore i am the only one on my side of the street uh 

Recording: (6520/ 9621) 
oh boy is this kindergarten teacher going to have fun with us

Recording: (6523/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (6524/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (6525/ 9621) 
i should not have some other thing to exchange for money i would much rather exchange ideas for money or previouslyly done work for money or something obnoxious and stupid like a franchise for money i have been favor of that i come up with a good system of which to do things they sell it to you you go do those things i said i am gonna make money off of your efforts yeah that so 

Recording: (6526/ 9621) 
but uh as i said i went to summer school too and 

Recording: (6527/ 9621) 
that is all right  

Recording: (6528/ 9621) 
yeah but i think carre practice would be more popular for the same type of reason uh yeah i 

Recording: (6529/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (6530/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (6531/ 9621) 
it is good money yeah um one idea that i just had recently is medical insurance which is a person who has md and his computers since those are my too many interests i thought doing those would be really cool 

Recording: (6532/ 9621) 
no no no but just a small independent 

Recording: (6533/ 9621) 
uh trying to avoid that question  pretty  no but uh i am a you know just get a little insight on what is going on out there in delaware and you know maybe possibly find someone to be with but 

Recording: (6534/ 9621) 
i know i know there is like somebody that says well you can even go to vietnam now in like but why would i  yeah it is like it is like that you know you can go you can go down to cuba but why would you it is like  and stuff uhhuhyou like going back in time so if you get you know like mind conveniences you know like toilets in the hot water and you know it is oh really oh really oh really oh really they do not have like your your basic amenities a minute it is my gosh  really uhhuhwhere is it at that came over to that the other side of the way back to the way back to the northern i do not even remember that that does not even like that but that but that do not they like uh that but the i thought they like i thought this like uh this is supposed to be like dormitory is or you know just you know they they they provide your basics but they are supposed to be like at least you know i mean you get what you pay for okay uhhuhyou know a really nice this day and out in new week uh the sleeping area is nice about as or or night uhokayokayso that was more the exception than the norm so where in europe did you go where did you well actually where was you we are not recommend going okay 

Recording: (6535/ 9621) 
you know and they some of them speak out 

Recording: (6536/ 9621) 
yeah now 

Recording: (6537/ 9621)

Recording: (6543/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6544/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (6545/ 9621) 
and i think that um the morals being you know especially at a young age you know abstin is the best policy so many people i i think they are turning two they are not going to have any thing  the only thing before they are married um but in today is life once you get into college and stuff it is a little hard to but i think a lot of more kids are going that route um because my parents never talked to me about six we all learned from our friends um my mother was very open but i think in today is world because really there was not there was not not many diseases i mean you know there was but you just did not hear about it 

Recording: (6546/ 9621) 
people more scared to you than you are they do not 

Recording: (6547/ 9621)

Recording: (6548/ 9621) 
uh the exercise i do a lot of walking anyway and swimming and stuff in the summer so 

Recording: (6549/ 9621) 
that is true 

Recording: (6550/ 9621) 
this was something that i would have done on monday night 

Recording: (6551/ 9621) 
about that valuable but they that is what they thought though you get it for free well you and then you uh you prove up on it as they say you you just build building the house and burn and and uh so that you live on it and uh i think i do not know i suppose form a certain amount of it i mean put in feet or whatever and uh then after five years you get a title to what gears so they thought well gee you know free free land to a farmer so uh they went out there but uh dan said in the eleven years that they were out there they only raised itthree or four across 

Recording: (6552/ 9621)

Recording: (6558/ 9621) 
the cafeteria is the first christian church and all the others our segments they want to be they still tie back to it but i do not want that it is like a commitment i just tell you well i would like to but could you make a little extra give me to where men are going to feel go oh yeah we will give you those okay we will start we will start on our own league up here and we will it and we will work on this stuff but then we are going to get two extra minutes in our rules okay we will eat this way and so forth so we we we develop things as they accommodate to our own selfish beans not to the sacrifice of what we should be doing and we are all more total and we are all going to be in that and i am not say no one makes those air makes air it is always there the problem is just trying to stay focused on that not a jump ship you know you are seeing this country and they do not like leaving 

Recording: (6559/ 9621) 
and then how they would execute them as is now 

Recording: (6560/ 9621) 
no more than five because there is a specific um it is called the five paragraphography the first paragraphs you are talking and the final one is your conclusion and the three in the middle is the body that develops your idea so i am teaching all my kids right 

Recording: (6561/ 9621)

blocked in now so you know i will be forty eight when i retire from here and i will be able to go out to the work place and feel like i have gotten good education and work skills from working here for this long and you know they have definitely paid for classes for me so i do not know what their big gripe is for education when they are breaking all this stuff i have never had a problem if you want to take a class we get classes we can take anything we want so 

Recording: (6569/ 9621) 
she needs a little more knowledge a little more support around you educating knowing selfdiscipline and on what is on the really important i would say the crazy is when you have multiple fathers and the children do not know the dads 

Recording: (6570/ 9621) 
um i i uh i do all my own taxes i really i keep thinking i must be doing wrong because it is not that hard everybody acts like oh this is such a big deal 

Recording: (6571/ 9621)

Recording: (6581/ 9621) 
just a few and and the guy came back from the next time and he said you said a real good weekend you know it is a good idea and it is true if you show each other over and over that they are really you are really value then it just keeps coming back to you 

Recording: (6582/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (6583/ 9621) 
oh okay 

Recording: (6584/ 9621)

Recording: (6585/ 9621) 
you know they talk about drinking from the fount and now they are only garland they are not drinking much by the time they get to be fourth or fifth grade they are pretty savvy these days they are not too scared to tell you where to go and what to do 

Recording: (6586/ 9621) 
yeah it is really expensive but that is why i went there for now i would not go there it was actually my last choice uh for universities but i went there because of the price 

Recording: (6587/ 9621) 
you know there is things about my dad that that i went along with them and and he he is great and he is wonderful to meet i mean my dad it is really wonderful to me but i mean things like like where my mom had me he he did not pick her up from the hospital i mean it is that kind of stuff that you would think what the hell were you thinking 

Recording: (6588/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (6589/ 9621) 
yeah i i was really glad that my son uh met you know was introduced to them or brought in or whatever they do because uh you know the guys are real real nice you know very it is very you know he is always kind of been like real standoffish when it comes to 

Recording: (6590/ 9621) 
i like that asks me i mean i do not know i do not pay attention to who the writers are um so maybe the writing has changed 

Recording: (6591/ 9621) 
yeah oh yeah 

Recording: (6592/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (6593/ 9621) 
yeah so 

Recording: (6594/ 9621) 
you know it is you know 

Recording: (6595/ 9621) 
oh i was a little bit on the test side yeah i 

Recording: (6596/ 9621) 
well i do not know the people that i see around uh you know they are grownups 

Recording: (6597/ 9621) 
middle 

Recording: (6598/ 9621) 
humum 

Recording: (6599/ 9621) 
right which is what we look like 

Recording: (6600/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6601/ 9621) 
 okay kid because i do not think i would know that one  whatever looks pretty when it comes to 

Recording: (6602/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (6603/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (6604/ 9621) 
yeah which cracks me up because if you have ever looked at the parents of models they are not necessarily all that attractive  yeah  

Recording: (6605/ 9621) 
it 

Recording: (6606/ 9621) 
i know that is why you have to get recorded  it it would be nice to have more than one concert but uh they they just they are on a sp used string they really are they get most of their money i think by well probably if you count in kind of contributions that western uh other line college pays for our rehearsal space our performance space and uh the salary the conductor uh so that is a huge amount of the money that they put into it and what we have to give them in return is an opportunity for people to play in an orchestra so sometimes we have college students play in the orchestra especially string players because they do not have uh college orchestra uh but once in a while we will get wind players play in it also and uh sometimes it leads to a little bit of friction when they get to play something you wanted to play  

Recording: (6607/ 9621) 
no she she still was down here my other sister has two niece and my nephew 

Recording: (6608/ 9621)

that is an embarrassment for a college this size 

Recording: (6610/ 9621) 
i am and they are my wife was not 

Recording: (6611/ 9621) 
it is all of that human being if they want to change if they got their minds set on they do not want to be with you know their other sex i do not think you know that is all up to that person i think 

Recording: (6612/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (6613/ 9621) 
i i make them you know time out one hour for two minutes 

Recording: (6614/ 9621)

yeah 

Recording: (6621/ 9621)

Recording: (6622/ 9621) 
yeah but you know what his parents are going you know really going to let people know that 

Recording: (6623/ 9621)

Recording: (6625/ 9621) 
kids because they are only little ones that is what they tell myself when i get really really frustrated they are only little ones and they will be growing up before i know it because 

Recording: (6626/ 9621) 
right i did not want to so i did not want to um 

Recording: (6627/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (6628/ 9621)

Recording: (6631/ 9621) 
oh really that is awesome 

Recording: (6632/ 9621) 
do it the hard way or the easy way  well i think everybody should have to do it the hard way i mean frankly um i think a lot of people get married without thinking enough about it 

Recording: (6633/ 9621) 
he is a picky eater which he you know he he does not like everything 

Recording: (6634/ 9621) 
computers that figure it out just to see myself and uh locate or positions on a map 

Recording: (6635/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (6636/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (6637/ 9621) 
umhum umhum 

Recording: (6638/ 9621) 
um well as far as my mom goes she is real into the catholic faith and i mean she made me always go to church and things like that 

Recording: (6639/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6640/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (6641/ 9621) 
you will 

Recording: (6642/ 9621) 
i would say we do at least an hour or more a day something like that 

Recording: (6643/ 9621) 
um you know you have to you know you do not have the choice but at the same time you do not right you do not want them to suffer but you want to keep them but it is whoop whoop i hope i did not move 

Recording: (6644/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6645/ 9621) 
or uh like the art shows in worthinton or the crafts or even the the irish festival double in double and which can be free yeah in certain days and things like that uh the concerts on the river around the worthentown green really anything like that 

Recording: (6646/ 9621) 
if they hold you know enough of my views i am not going to vote for a woman just because they are a woman and i am not going to vote for a democrat just because they are a democrat they better have them you know at least and and i do not need a hundred percent uh agreement with my views but i would like they would be it in the ninety to ninety five percent range um but yeah i do not tend to vote straight party line either as i said i have i have moderated from when i was uh in college to today part of the the aging process and also partly because i have i have noticed that to get things done you have to have a center and it is the center that tends to rule when i was in college um we had a bumper sticker that said america fix it or forget it and some of the construction people in dayton came out with one that said america love it or leave it uh and today i realize that both of those positions are wrong it is america love it and fix it just like with your kids you love your kids but you do not let them you know have bad matters at the table and you do not let them run around with the wrong you know kids and you want them to behave well you know that is how i see america now and and america is become more centered uh and when it devates from that either way that is when people become upset um so i just think it is important now i remember when um who was the other president that i voted for that won carter uh black liters would meet with him once a week and then they would come out and hold this press conference and complain about he did not do this for blacks and he did not do this and he did not do this and he did not do this and he did not do this and he did not do this and he did not do this and he did not do this and he did not do this did not do that enough for blacks he did not do this and he did not do that and i used to say you know just some of my black friends do not you see what you are doing do not you see the greater applications of this oh no we need to having moved faster i said you know that would be great in an ideal world this is not an ideal world you have to take it a step at a time whether you like it or not and what you are going to do is you are going to make it look like he is so bad on all the issues you are going to give people a reason to vote against him then if any big issue comes up that is just going to be added to everything else and what you need to do is after you have this meeting with him is come out and raise him and he is doing a good job and they were moving along steadily and and i you know i do not think sometimes people who do politics of the negative understand what it means um i made that mistake when i was president of the dayton education association and we were trying to get a levy pass so we went around as teachers showing all of the bad conditions in the school all the leaking you know uh ceilings all of the peeling floors all the the bad shock board with cracks in them and all that kind of stuff and it had the opposite effect of what we thought people got the schools that are so bad they said we are not gonna support those and they voted no so the next time we did an opposite check we went in and we said you know eight months later on the board put another um about uh levy on the the ballet we said these are great schools we have great teachers look at this kid he is learning to read he is made six months improvement in three months and all that time it was image and uh we were saying the same thing you know we want to continue this we want to make even this better um we learn to say the negative is in a positive way in that is important you know and you need to get that you you need to appeal to the center americans do not like extreme liberals they do not like extreme conservative you know they want they want peace  

Recording: (6647/ 9621) 
oh gosh 

Recording: (6648/ 9621) 
and unions not going to do that 

Recording: (6649/ 9621) 
it was on national news you see i am not that informed on that um 

Recording: (6650/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (6651/ 9621) 
yeah i did not want to 

Recording: (6652/ 9621) 
yeah like i said uh parts no different 

Recording: (6653/ 9621) 
uh trying to figure out what else to tell you i work here at the university uh twenty four years

yeah well for so long i ate peanuts and i loved them and peanut butter and then two years ago i started getting a reaction from it and um finally did go to the doctor because i i i was so ill from it um and he said you are allergic um mainly it was the skins on like spanish peanuts and things and i never but my body must have build up the three action to it because i i was always fine eating them and then they really turned on me so now i can not even eat any peanut products or the oil because everybody said well you can eat natural peanut butter and i do not like no it is the oil in there you know they grind if the peanuts in still oil but um i probably had it for a long time when i was getting sick and think i had the fluid or something and 

Recording: (6659/ 9621) 
well i think a little bit safer idea than uh eliminating guns because you know there is always going to be weapons out there instead of eliminating the problem you know more centralized it make it a national law they have to be a certain age give a certain time period for background checks and whatever else can of record finding they need make sure you are you know not going to just go out and blow somebody is head off for no reason you are keeping it for you know just either security reasons hunting reasons or practice you know but 

Recording: (6660/ 9621)

um 

Recording: (6748/ 9621) 
boy i you know i i do not have a kid and then you know not being that close to it it is hard to know i mean i have always i have always thought that that uh what their friends did and what they what they were exposed to at home had as much influences as anything that that the school could do but i know the school schools are very powerful forth in the kids life you know i mean it is the kids life 

Recording: (6749/ 9621)

Recording: (6750/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6751/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6752/ 9621) 
well how he felt and knowing that we were not neglecting him of two different things we have always emphasized that knowing what is right or knowing that what is justice is one thing and stealing with the emotions this is another one 

Recording: (6753/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6754/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6755/ 9621) 
no not at all i would have rather vote him from a can but over bush because bush he he comes from a political family which i am not saying he is wrong because the kennedys are a big political family but i am saying like bush is um he just seems like he did not really like he everything is been handed to him in the nice and uh the issue of like whether he did drugs and that is that is a big issue but i do not like the way he addressed you know that to me just if he did drug okay everyone might experiment or try or make a mistake but the way he is handling it saying i am not even going to they did not find that question over it over it over if he did not do it he might as well just be like no i did not do it 

Recording: (6756/ 9621) 
no  actually i was uh going to get my ged after that 

Recording: (6757/ 9621) 
yeah with all the controversy about that and the police um uh i do not know it is northland is such uh a good location for all the people around there and it is certainly not you know um um uh hurting day or you know a neighborhood that people do not need the shopping so i did not see the difference of having both i mean there is the others everywhere there is sears everywhere or not why not having both places i mean i would not particularly go up to parlorers if they take northland but we are not planning on staying there anyway so i did not yeah will probably move within a year umhum 

Recording: (6758/ 9621)

i can not get back to being at home did your mother give you everything he want then she failed you did not she 

Recording: (6762/ 9621) 
and of course i think too uh in america the uh the farm families you know they wanted that was more labor for the then you heard so to speak so i think that might have influenced a lot of that but over the years it it uh it just made sense to me in fact it looks like in my family that their going the children are going to be mostly in two you know not even going to three or four i mean it is not over yet but my girls are forty two and forty one soon to be forty one so uh i think that their childbearing years are over 

Recording: (6763/ 9621)

Recording: (6764/ 9621)

Recording: (6766/ 9621) 
att attention deficit high product of it is order 

Recording: (6767/ 9621) 
no there is a lot of people go to church that are not worth anything too you know so i do not really believe that going to church you know uh uh makes you a better argument than another you know thing i believe that you know you are i believe that most people is basic uh structured in life if it is based similar to the bible or you could sayism or whatever you know uh uh that you intend to have a better wife than you will if you practice quote unquote really this is what really this way but i do not believe somebody going to church makes them a better you know being the next person uh because there is a lot of hypocrites that goes to church uh these kids i i think more just more than anything else i mean one thing i have i remember hearing at all about too was that where they were picked on 

Recording: (6768/ 9621) 
and uh says quite i lost my job after that and things got difficult more and more difficult um was unable to work full time i am doing some part time work right now working with people with mental illness um but it is you know the the thing i am running into out there is that uh nobody wants to pay to do anything  uh i do not understand that but uh and then the one they do want you to do something they abuse the hell idea you know and give you a major yourself on the one and i will tell you where you are morning and eight seven days a week and i found another business uh so uh the frustrations with trying to find an adequate job and an adequate employer that understand some of my situation and and how i operate and will give me freedom to do what i can do i have a bachelor of arts in communications but it is been more of a problem than it is been a asset um interviewing for jobs people that uh were doing the interviewing had just a high school education and uh they are not going to hire me when after a year i would be their boss um so a lot of that is out there uh regardless of what people say i am not trying to be pessimistic and negative it is just been my experience uh unfortunately um i hope it gets better but uh like i said i have not been ever uh told of my degree matters by any employer or compared to what the news tells you and what people will tell you oh go get that college degree uh you know people told me as soon as they got over college then i needed a master is and then they said after you are a master is you will definitely need your doctorate well you know the people saying this are college people they college is the business uh and it takes a while to realize that if you can get in and get that education on grand money and scholarship that is that is good but then even now being a person with uh eye disability from the brain injury uh i mean i do not even like to call it disability i i have uh different abilities now you know same abilities they used to do but i have to do them a different way um just because my brain functions on a different level and i can not explain that to anybody and i should not have to but i am always forced to um but uh trying to find a job you know uh results from this has been difficult and uh and and it is you know i am not given up hope or something like that i am just trying to trying to cut through and see what i can do and uh you know there is just uh uh it is very limited out there you know in in your education is is it as up but like i said even as a person uh now going through bpr um i am discriminated against in my opinion because i have a bachelor is in other words uh bureau of occasional rehabilitation which is government funded organization gear towards helping people withf is abilities get back to work and uh because i already have a bachelor is that will not pay for school now if i was stupid you know if i just had a basic just got out of grade school and did not even have my ged boy they would pay for my high school my college and everything you know even living expenses you know but because they have a bachelor is nothing you know 

Recording: (6769/ 9621)

Recording: (6794/ 9621) 
i went to brookhaven which is uh up on call road near north and

Recording: (6796/ 9621) 
umhum yeah 

Recording: (6797/ 9621) 
and we could not have class and in addition they were like trying to tip over bosses and throwing stones out them

Recording: (6799/ 9621) 
well i i work was around mostly black people and it is a weird situation uh oh our more prejudice than i have noticed now than when only worked around a couple of them 

Recording: (6800/ 9621)

Recording: (6801/ 9621) 
there are some um foreign activities classes or foreign type culture classes or foreign understanding classes 

Recording: (6802/ 9621) 
um well my oldest one is it is really odd because uh the school she goes to it is sort of like uh thrift store sheak and a lot of kids there go to thrift stores and buy their clothes and i told her i said you know we are not in the poor house you are not buying clothes at the thrift door so she basically went to my closet and took everything that was old of mine and wore it and i thought oh my gosh you know because she just looks like a bum i think and you know when it was time for like a uh a a dance or something she would go out and buy a dress you know at penney is or some place at the mall you know and maybe spend like eighty dollars for a dress and the same thing would happen every time she would go and come home i would go what did they say you know about your dress and she goes julina is that you and i go see you clean up really nice they said you know you have the best shape you are ever going to have your life and what are you doing you wear these big baggy clothes and these dagy pants and i said you know when you get when you get near fifties and you have got a gut in a big house you know you could do that 

Recording: (6803/ 9621) 
and so 

Recording: (6804/ 9621) 
and then um like people who work go back until they you know maybe two to six um the kids are down of school from the day at lake door one 

Recording: (6805/ 9621) 
in the elementary school library uh we focus on sex so much in our society i think and and part of family the sex is such a small part of family life you know i mean it uh especially with the elementary school kids i mean it is just in their milk and cookies after school 

Recording: (6806/ 9621) 
but we go out and look at we look at it differently in sports than we do this differently in uh the uh second world very we are

Recording: (6900/ 9621) 
well that basically as they ever you know as your influx of people move out or city limits and everything you know then uh you know you have got to have places for them to shot and everything and basically the northland malls been there forever jake who owned indians owned it uh he never did anything to it you know so he got your your last better pennies and uh mainstay places that generally move there because of the uh years ago because it was something well it was right there or they with a lot of people population and everything and then like i say if you know if you got basically the people moving out to get away from the the traffic and all that stuff you know that is they are moving away from us they are still getting into it but uh but just your perspective on uh then you you are talking to if you build it they will come they say you know so umhum umhum i guess you still going to build it so 

Recording: (6901/ 9621) 
some of them are pretty good at that some of them are not too hum some of them like when you have them copy like up from this box down to this box these little shades in a certain amount of time if their visual perception is messed up they screw that all up they you know the form goes this way they draw it this way their brain slips it around on them that is why they have trouble with ends and used and bees and dees and they are still doing it you know they are still or they might make an eight from the bottom up instead of from the top down or six from the bottom up i even had a kid once that made one from the bottom up you could tell by watching them right that their brain did not work like yours did 

Recording: (6902/ 9621) 
i just like to the smaller 

Recording: (6903/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6904/ 9621) 
yeah yeah people say things like oh i wish i had a job where i got three months off every summer and on this i hear people say stuff like that in the grocery store and i just want to walk up to the guy and grab him around the neck and say yeah and yesterday while you were watching the football game i was getting papers at the kitchen table you know and if i go out of town on the weekend i have to take my school bag and all my work with me it never ends you know i put it in about seventy hours a week during the time of the year when i do teach and by the way it is not three months anymore you work for a week after the kids get out of the school in june which usually puts you at about the twelfth to the fifteenth in june school starts back the twenty third of august at least in worthinton it did and you have to be back a week before that so they have shaved both ends of that also it is like ten days in june and maybe fifteen days in august and all of july so and then you spend some of that time going to seminars and upgraded your certificate 

Recording: (6905/ 9621) 
i mean i some ways i think competition is a bad thing because in our society it is usually not fair someone always starts out ahead and they able to get ahead further but i mean i like the fact that we have got this super high tech paper corner not a big real to real thing i like the fact that i could do a lot of my research for my thesis on a computer internet rather than like going to the card catalog funny out that there are books that are that are not in our library and then where do i go from there um i like being able to look oh library of congress has it i will just drive out to washington or have them send it here you know um that i think is a major contribution of the past generation uh 

Recording: (6906/ 9621) 
uh which is nice to got a lot of support from everybody it gets gets going kind of confusing on holidays 

Recording: (6907/ 9621) 
is not that unbelievable 

Recording: (6908/ 9621) 
oh yeah archie bunkerers meets fred flintstone area going  

Recording: (6909/ 9621) 
yep i graduated from brookhaven 

Recording: (6910/ 9621) 
i do not know you can do it beat my very hand you know so 

Recording: (6911/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (6912/ 9621) 
yeah exactly 

Recording: (6913/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6914/ 9621) 
really caught 

Recording: (6915/ 9621) 
yeah i have lived with my mom since then 

Recording: (6916/ 9621) 
iowa 

Recording: (6917/ 9621) 
yeah like it will be under something real weird or like multim media or something like that you know it is like i do not know who how they design it that way 

Recording: (6918/ 9621) 
makes it difficult to the adjustment 

Recording: (6919/ 9621) 
yeah most of them do and then you know pretty much the rest of them just hang out  go to school 

Recording: (6920/ 9621) 
see that is how my husband was they did not even have a pet growing up 

Recording: (6921/ 9621) 
well i know it was myself when we had he would always said that it was not for me he would have gotten just too amused in his job because he is really involved you know he likes what he is doing his tremendous of responsibility and but he loves it but the thing is when the kids were little too you know i was always having to pull him back and say do not forget you know they are going to grow up fast if you if you do not spend this time and now i mean like i said the youngest is thirteen and so he is been at this for all these years and i do not have to do that anymore i mean some place along the way about ten years ago he got so involved in their lives but when they are little 

Recording: (6922/ 9621) 
usually go out to lunch at like some fast food place and then we get together and cook dinner 

Recording: (6923/ 9621) 
so we live over the standards to meet that 

Recording: (6924/ 9621) 
the shipw called and they were up very desirableing ship and we come in tourteous and old sheep walker 

Recording: (6925/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6926/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (6927/ 9621) 
you know you know do i feel safe is this place i can go is there is somebody who always takes care of me and and i think left to their own devices 

Recording: (6928/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6929/ 9621) 
umhum yeah because they think they are grown they think they are grown and they are like twelve and thirteen and they have been having sex since they were ten and it is just like  and yeah and they are having babies earlier and earlier and it is just really scary 

Recording: (6930/ 9621) 
right i have a neighbor that is that 

Recording: (6931/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (6932/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (6933/ 9621) 
right well not just one my older brother would have been two and a half or three 

Recording: (6934/ 9621) 
you know i think i i just think that typically you see a lot of people lot of places that are that are under construction not very many people working there 

Recording: (6935/ 9621) 
because i was going to be opening up on the sixth um looking forward to doing that we had a um uh seasons past two wayne jack lake spend a lot of time to the pools um different swim centers hundred different rec centers the y programs are excellent even here at a high state they have got the um um recreational sports on sunday afternoons where they can go um we go to the zoo a lot librarys have story times reading hours those type of things uh them just all kinds of community things used to eightsons at the recs hundredst uners 

Recording: (6936/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (6937/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (6938/ 9621) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (6939/ 9621) 
i think so 

Recording: (6940/ 9621) 
discipline i would be screamed that made to get jumped on the floor to do push ups i mean it was it was 

Recording: (6941/ 9621) 
do anything but touch the computer and sometimes it is like six and seven hours a day at the computer and i just do not want to do it 

Recording: (6942/ 9621) 
retire yeah 

Recording: (6943/ 9621) 
that was all on it 

Recording: (6944/ 9621) 
that is exactly how i mean when you say what would i do you know i might to a house and i might just go to school some i used to own a gallery i might do something like that again you know there is just like there is just zillions of projects out there waiting to happen and so it is just 

Recording: (6945/ 9621) 
it is just the spirit the spiritual aspect there is around even onlstein the most brilliant man supposedly mathematics all of our time uh even said that there will be people or should be people come along with better theories than he has yet but nobody is taking the time or made the time to challenge this area 

Recording: (6946/ 9621) 
that would probably affect my decision a little bit 

Recording: (6947/ 9621) 
yeah that guy at spring break a couple of teachers who are taking a bunch of kids 

Recording: (6948/ 9621) 
uh will goes on uh you know nationally you know uh especially interested in this presidential election 

Recording: (6949/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (6950/ 9621) 
do not you think 

Recording: (6951/ 9621) 
but then they have one injury and then what are they going to do they got to think of that they have a free education and they just do not think of it that way you know they think they can make enough money and but you know 

Recording: (6952/ 9621) 
and also at the show of hands gallard is 

Recording: (6953/ 9621) 
do 

Recording: (6954/ 9621) 
i wish they would clean it up more often yeah no it is not springing out from where i am  i do not live in the suburbia area so i mean i live i live right in the middle of all the houses that have been there for six or seventy years and i am smack out in the middle of all the frats and sororities on campus so i am like yeah it is yeah it is fine spread it out fine i just think it is funny i i would love to get a good nice overhead view of columbus because you probably see the house after house after house and you know like they did right in the right in the um fifties uh i came over what it is called like where every single house is a near image of the one right beside it i mean you got all these streets that are in the exact same pattern all you know you know for like miles and miles and miles but um no i think it is cool that they are all spread out oh yeah one thing they could really do with columbus that i have noticed or i would say lack of noticed in any other city in the united states why in the world did they have to work on all the roads all at the same time i do not understand they have to they are working on three fifty two seventy seventy one six seventy eight all at the same time why why i do not understand it yeah apparently notyeah apparentlynot really  

Recording: (6955/ 9621) 
umhum oh station uh purtue station was in north carolina 

Recording: (6956/ 9621) 
yeah he they could afford to go there so they did not 

Recording: (6957/ 9621) 
and they got 

Recording: (6958/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6959/ 9621) 
okay yeah sure i that is okay 

Recording: (6960/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (6961/ 9621) 
aconfire them because they are gave i could care less 

Recording: (6962/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (6963/ 9621) 
so how i this works out you know i do not know i just i am just like okay she just says i just want to get it over with and see now she you know 

Recording: (6964/ 9621) 
well her major is communications it did not start out that but my daughter wants to write books again wow  

Recording: (6965/ 9621) 
no i am living yeah that is my my uh girl call 

Recording: (6966/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (6967/ 9621) 
her mother did not want to see it and everything we were divorced at the time and uh then i went and bought the movie and 

Recording: (6968/ 9621) 
and then how so as far as that to them when you have a chance to talk to them that is what we need to learn more from interview have more meaningful interviews of these people so that we can learn from them i put them in a spot light but we so now we do not still wanna uh i guess flood them up the we do not wanna get the negative answer because all my heard the image of the university oh gee now uh we who was it cats and lawyers i oh yeah well hey we realize that the university only wants players who drawgate money that is all they want to do they do not have back to having they do not talk about the activities when they are coming to the high state 

Recording: (6969/ 9621) 
the teacher was there one day and she was pregnant with twins and the second day she was in the hospital um those things happen 

Recording: (6970/ 9621) 
it was 

Recording: (6971/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (6972/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6973/ 9621) 
a lot of people have switch from being like the really quiet more reserved people to the party animal 

Recording: (6974/ 9621) 
um i would kind of say most people i know are at least fairly ethical i mean there is no more sentencing groups in the other that i know 

Recording: (6975/ 9621) 
eventually 

Recording: (6976/ 9621) 
 he worked he 

Recording: (6977/ 9621) 
um i think so i think partial birth is not such a big issue because i mean it hardly ever comes up but i with so many things it is it is like a foot and a door if we can do that then we can say well you know maybe not in the third try master and then we can say well not in the second try master and 

Recording: (6978/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (6979/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6980/ 9621) 
i have almost bit here i do not know how many times people talking on telephones i see people turn them in the turn themselves 

Recording: (6981/ 9621) 
there there is a way back to access to some of our system that is all of them were putting them more uniform on up for everything and i do not it may be they oh i wish you had some system but they going to connect our system for things they do have in their system and it is so i am not sure what system you are talking about 

Recording: (6982/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (6983/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (6984/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6985/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (6986/ 9621) 
yeah yeah yeah you can not ignore it i mean because you know because that is something else when i was in high school i do not think i knew the word but um now everybody knows uh am anybody who is a little bit different is likely to be called the jag  and and so it is better if you can refuse that but i boy i would not know how to approach it i mean i think it should be approached but ooh i would not have a clue 

Recording: (6987/ 9621) 
 they let you know like five hundred people in electrical yeah 

Recording: (6988/ 9621) 
yeah i uh two thirty seven 

Recording: (6989/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (6990/ 9621) 
the united states knows about it they can not sit there and they will pay the welfare they will not do nothing to him 

Recording: (6991/ 9621) 
 right real warm  

Recording: (6992/ 9621) 
right and it is all the bucks yeah because people i work with you know uh there are there are some people i work with that have house payments one guy he has the biggest twenty two hundred dollars a month and a lot of them have like fifty hundred and up and you know i bought my house years and years ago and it is like four eighty five and i would not dare tell them that but it is like you know they because they are always you know they have people there that make a lot more money than i do and and they are always like broke but yet you know like when they go do something they have got to have the best of everything the best that it is like you know you know uh to me you just have to kind of think about things little bit and it is like you know do i do i really need to go to uh what would i say um uh tga fridays for lunch and spend twelve dollars we are going to taco bell and spend like three and use the other part for maybe like uh book for my kid or you know uh they have like my daughter is in swimming i need the money for a swim suit well why do not i use it for that you know so its 

Recording: (6993/ 9621) 
because it is more open uh and you couch it in terms of civil rights uh my boyfriend is thinks it is wrong morally but does not think we ought to be discriminating against uh he he thinks it is a sin therefore he thinks they should be dependent in the way to do that as through you know talking to them religion wise um i do not think it is the same i think it uh your sexuality is gene c based in that i you can no more change your sexual orientation than you can the color of your eyes or your hair you may put a die on it or you may put a different uh whatever those eye pieces are contacts i do not wear glasses so i can never remember those terms um but that is just becauseetic and anyone who tries to change your sexual orientation that is cosmedic too uh and again my belief is whatever happens between considering adults is their business not mine um so i do not know that anyone could change it uh what was your question again 

Recording: (6994/ 9621) 
uh wander around to look at things 

Recording: (6995/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6996/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6997/ 9621) 
well it is got to come from the top uhyou know i i just felt like there was just a total lack of interest in the student from from every directionso i would say you know it is an organizational problem and job you know properly now i live down the street from what they call because it is a columbus uh alternative high school and uh you get there through a lottery system and they have the best reputation of all the columbus schools and uh those kids leave there getting full scholarship uh my son went there one year uh it was a disaster for him 

Recording: (6998/ 9621) 
yeah they are of a pro strike we getting plenty of in book ideas but you know 

Recording: (6999/ 9621) 
a bad one or a good one 

Recording: (7000/ 9621) 
so it is been a lot of pressure there 

Recording: (7001/ 9621) 
and uh a disease that affected her mind and of course you know back then i did not really know that but there was a lot of conflict 

Recording: (7002/ 9621) 
yeah it was yeah it was interesting 

Recording: (7003/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7004/ 9621) 
flip me out 

Recording: (7005/ 9621) 
and how can you do that 

Recording: (7006/ 9621) 
i mean i did not have the greatest chance as i do not think any of this they are really had the best you know but i do not like i and a little girl once said over here she is probably about eight maybe six or something like that and she was not even sat here a mommy so she made her sit with her which was cool and mama just goes to sleep and little kid is trying to study her homework you know for oh welli do not know was he up on that party and was he up on that work anyhow or what the hell was your problem 

Recording: (7007/ 9621) 
i do not really see anybody i was totally ready to vote for a his been door and then she opened her mouth and things came out and  uh she had the best chance at any uh any woman that is ever run for president and she was in a major party which has not happened before and it would have been really funny he would happen to bob dole over it you know it would be the first man after having run to the office 

Recording: (7008/ 9621) 
but they but then in the very next month they said well in two weeks we are going to uh california to visit paul now now and anyhow i was telling you each of my children because i was upset and i was telling them this and they are all going oh mom you know my other girls are going on you know and my my daughter who is thirteen is fabulous she is so blunt she is such she is just so out there and so different from so many other children uh and she said well do you actually care up your comes here you do not care do you and i said well i do not care but it makes me feel bad it hurts my feelings 

Recording: (7009/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7010/ 9621) 
my person do not believe they should be allowed to because i believe they they should have the male is it the you know the gentleman for a proper pretty you know 

Recording: (7011/ 9621) 
you know i think a lot of it depends on i do not know for just different parts of the country but cultures and everything because you know it just seems in uh some parts of the midwest but maybe kentucky and wally seems gross down there a lot of them get married so young they just that is just what they want to do you know they do not but they are not thinking of any future or wanting to go to college or anything like that i am sorry  i did not want to be like 

Recording: (7012/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (7013/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (7014/ 9621) 
absolutely 

Recording: (7015/ 9621) 
or something like that just for something to do 

Recording: (7016/ 9621) 
having some time uh probably i my freshman here in high school uh we are just walking down high street and now here is there wrong place at the wrong time and some people like ill and stuff and we could not make out with their sand 

Recording: (7017/ 9621) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (7018/ 9621) 
first grade the first grade teacher was aware of what he needed the principal would not let her give it to him with a give him sense had to do whatever anything anybody else in the class was doing he was even tutoring some of the kids in the grade and it the last grading period she would give them it she she would every day she would give them a math paper to work on and he said i said you know i know how do this i am not doing it 

Recording: (7019/ 9621) 
just seems like a waste of legislation money 

Recording: (7020/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7021/ 9621) 
you wanted to where i was born 

Recording: (7022/ 9621) 
yeah and she is just like yeah the minute are we walking the door it is like you guys clock out 

Recording: (7023/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (7024/ 9621) 
as it was jacobs sold to the northland mall anyway so it is probably going to be like a strict mall more or less 

Recording: (7025/ 9621) 
yeah she does everybody over by her hospital 

Recording: (7026/ 9621) 
to mary them and she moved over and 

Recording: (7027/ 9621) 
i mean as old as i am i still got that against him and that is what i i want my you know my son to keep i want him to know his father and be around him even though he is not the best best a person but you know 

Recording: (7028/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (7029/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7030/ 9621) 
well see that is not proved out by the the approval rating he still has higher approval rating than reagan had in his last eighteen months so you know people still like what he what he is done i think that that um that you know people do not like all the crap that went with him is the pundance on tv you know they say that and they are they are still trying to get him i mean before he was even elected they were trying to get him which is what they would have done to a livesable door they would not have been able to attack on the issues so they would find other things to get get around so they started bringing out all these women and all that stuff on and most people did not care about it they did not care about it before the election they did not care about it during his campaign they trying to make an issue out of nothing it was not watergate you know he may have been a cat you know he may have uh but she was twenty one it is not like it was someone who could make up her own mind what she wanted to do you know and he may have been stupid in a cat but i do not wanna know about it on day one when it hits the news i did not wanna know about it and on the end when he was you know not in peach i did not wanna know about it and in between i did not to know about it and they just kept angering me because there were other things i wanted the government to do and this congress is the worst i have ever seen and i am getting anything done and not really being able to be on the ready of of where america is on such issues as gun control and women is rights and and things that are important to people you know they they try to make sudo issues out of clinton and then they try to make a sue issue out of you know giving a tax cut people do not want a tax cut when it is going to affect their social security or affect you know uh the the deficit 

Recording: (7031/ 9621) 
yeah but yeahum i think the mother has more of it instinct for that but as far as the studies go or the people roll over in their babies i do not see how you could roll over on anything that size and not know it unless you were on drugs or drunk or whatever you know what i mean 

Recording: (7032/ 9621) 
um i would like to teach um the the field is particularly structured right now so i am not holding out hopes for a teaching job i mean i would like to think that i could dispish myself within the field and get a job but i mean right now those jobs simply are not available so uh i am approaching things like whatever happens happens i am going to pursue my interest and then go on from there rather than necessarily thinking about career plans after i finish my schooling 

Recording: (7033/ 9621)

Recording: (7042/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (7043/ 9621)

Recording: (7044/ 9621) 
there was been some serious consideration but no there was some outlaw someone took up a position and was ones to do it but he is decided he did not want to devote that much time away from his uh his television program oh he he is quite a smart fellow reallyumhumi think that is what you mean i did not get into one of them person or another over here uh has been influenced within our families uh we have minister we have doctors we have lawyers we have uh farmers we have uh farmers we have uh politicians  of what else we got in there we have 

Recording: (7045/ 9621)

it is crazy because everybody wants to buy us everything you know and i have got home my gosh they like give me a list of some music i want to get this and i want to get that so it is just it is just been  it is been something else which is which is getting done because our family is our party somewhere and they are all 

Recording: (7049/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (7050/ 9621) 
uh civil rights only went so far they have not corrected the wrongs in the past they have not uh created uh uh uh a a sense of the society that anyone can it to eat like the american dream in my opinion is an absolute lie 

Recording: (7051/ 9621) 
and they were just wild you know i just ran every minute and i took it as a substitute and did not know from day to day you know whether it was going to keep it i finally had to say i can not do this twenty seven kind of course i am sorry i can not do this by my self  

Recording: (7052/ 9621) 
really so is it is it sounds like they the the economy is pretty good right now well right now right now oh jimmy okay not too many doctors apparently over there  

Recording: (7053/ 9621) 
i i have been now i am i can remember from my relationship my dad was uh out of town quite a bit when we were growing up so uh from a maternal aspect you know mom was there all the time and uh and a lot of times she feel to the both the male and the female and the mother and the father role you know as far as punishment and everything like that but uh uh it just would depend i i know in my respect it would have been a lot better i think for myself or than everything you know i mean for you know if we would have been able to had uh john custer with her and everything you know which has grown up because my do not what bar being out there i mean you know you can just imagine she is you know been being a girl and i am saying a girl in any bad about girl has been my daughter you know more into about things in school and weekends and stuff like that so where as i was closer to her i would not worry so much about it so 

Recording: (7054/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7055/ 9621) 
and he got broken into and uh you know he is paying run on this apartment and he is back home because the police said that this apartment has been hit many times so it is just a big mess right now you know he had uh a nice uh you know it is better close stolen his jewelry you know jewelry uh a few other minor things they did not want his tv and vcr and those kind of things he gets stolen so they move them back home and they start worrying about something else and that moves by then he is worried about his car because somebody down the street got their curstling so it is just uh going to be a matter of rearranging he is um applying for another scholarship he gets some already so he would get this other scholarship i think it uh would help him uh be able to move into the for an opportunity i think you can get out of the apartment by suburb leasing it because to get the seventy five dollars to give to the land lord to they charge seventy five to do that to advertise and uh screen 

Recording: (7056/ 9621) 
i mean obviously everyone has their dark side but i would say in a general people are pretty good people 

Recording: (7057/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (7058/ 9621) 
yeah it is 

Recording: (7059/ 9621) 
i i moved into the dorms late september last fall 

Recording: (7060/ 9621) 
what 

Recording: (7061/ 9621) 
by i would not push it on them because that is almost made me be resentful towards being catholic just the fact that i had it forced on me 

Recording: (7062/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (7063/ 9621) 
well the uh both family and uh the mcdonald is have been around forever you know uh worth it in indians and and the both family have close to spatch uh and then he got uh i think his virgin he was the like a was a construction guy so uh uh they have been around forever and everything and uh they can get their ways through uh political orientous and everything but i think most of the money was uh was private money but they were given like tax incentives and things of that nature 

Recording: (7064/ 9621) 
so it it it is a pretty much a worthy place 

Recording: (7065/ 9621) 
 and uh yeah i i uh i would never i would i would never want to go back to the old way never 

Recording: (7066/ 9621) 
and field of children is really i found it really interesting because there is uh when you get into figuring firing data 

Recording: (7067/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (7068/ 9621) 
he he is like 

Recording: (7069/ 9621) 
what it is is most people want do not want kids living around 

Recording: (7070/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7071/ 9621) 
and and you know legal sanctions are going to make any particular difference to the attitude you have going into it 

Recording: (7072/ 9621) 
that is a round of way i am getting there 

Recording: (7073/ 9621) 
i would not doubt it i hope they vote against it but i do not think they will 

Recording: (7074/ 9621) 
it is kind of it is kind of hard when you are looking at the the oil candidates here you know so some of the issues i thought were kind of important but when you are looking at the the oil candidates did you watch that debate 

Recording: (7075/ 9621) 
because it stopsbs your heart right away 

Recording: (7076/ 9621) 
no i i do not think so 

Recording: (7077/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7078/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7079/ 9621) 
in 

Recording: (7080/ 9621) 
umhum but there is things that are difficult like they are this is where we go we we have a temple too and they can not go in the temple well they can but they have to fit fit certain criteria they have to be advertised and not involved with all these health codes and all the different codes and but that is not what they are interested in doing so and and that is hard i think in like going on a mission really they did not understand that they are my god just like they know how small you are they are saying he used i would be area and so 

Recording: (7081/ 9621) 
well when you think about the different generations and things we certainly did not have the things to worry about that people do now who was i was in elementary and junior high and we would have never dreamed of anybody having a good gun or even let alone a nice i mean that and that is violence and that is that goes back to kids and how much time and and effort you put into them you know kids are ignored and pushed aside and they are in the way and there is so many people that do not even want them and you know and then they get into school and they get violent and they they take it out you know and everybody is surprised you know i am not because i know there is a lot of anger and a lot of hate for these little kids and um in going to school it is going to be so dangerous i think because you have so many of them in one little room and they are coming from so many different background and if you take each one of their situations i can bet the statistics as time goes on that they they are not going to have one caring parent you know maybe not even one of their parents you know they might have a foster family or you know somebody that wants to pretend like they care you know there is a lot of the people that that are foster families that only want the money you know and and there is all that so it is it is really scary and i think i think that it something has to be done real fast i do not know what i think it starts from what we teach them and as adults what we allow to be out there the computers i mean oh my gosh i did not even get a computer because i was so afraid of what they could be able to access there was not you know there was nothing barred at all when they first came out yeah and you know where are all those software people and they are not responsible for why to pay they are not responsible for you know all this internet access to all this stuff so it is really hard 

Recording: (7082/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7083/ 9621) 
towards possess in to us i might be able to figure out what my problem is because i started running i started running windows two thousand about three months ago that was a dumb mistake one of the guys in my house is software private and he was like oh your computer will run two thousand he was like oh your computer will run two thousand he was like oh your computer will run two thousand let us put it on your computer so i was 

Recording: (7084/ 9621) 
older kids you know 

Recording: (7085/ 9621) 
well you have to uh try some different things like put on head phones with music that does not have many words and try to read somewhere like 

Recording: (7086/ 9621) 
you know i never i i used to uh have an office out there that i visited all the time but uh i have never been out there to she actually lives in corkwood which is a suburb 

Recording: (7087/ 9621)

Recording: (7088/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (7089/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (7090/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (7091/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (7092/ 9621) 
yeah it is mainly what happens is uh you get all the out of town bad stuff you know i mean it just kind of absorbs like a sponge 

Recording: (7093/ 9621) 
well i believe it is quality is not quite going to uh ideally you know uh from one part it would be they are being they or if you know you know in the anyway you know they but uh the you know the meat could go come home and you know you want to do is sit down and start doing your drinking beer or whatever you know not spending any time with your child it does not matter whether you are there all day or whether you are there for two hours 

Recording: (7094/ 9621) 
it is just been fun 

Recording: (7095/ 9621) 
i have no idea it is kind of like picking the the least of evils i mean 

Recording: (7096/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (7097/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (7098/ 9621) 
and my mother was always there for me i would just call my mom like you know what can i do and she just like calm down very children just calm down and 

Recording: (7099/ 9621) 
go go go so it is tough 

Recording: (7100/ 9621) 
well it is not it is not how it is put into effect the law it is how it is enforced you know you do not just say well you know low johnny stuck is finger in the pie and you can not do that anymore and you know the more the more security you are going to have over that pie the more he is going to want it so and and going into the gun thing it is pretty much nobody is winning game i mean you make stricter laws you are going to get you know even more and more people you know struggling to get a gun and shoot somebody is head off so um all the school thing pretty much says itself metal detectors and police at the schools you know has come down to that nowadays and uh any gun you get from criminals you know should i mean they already melt them that buck a scale but there is a little bit more you can do with those than burn them you know you could set them up uh some kind of top secret lab you know out in dc somewhere the panhandle of guns just have rooms and room stack full of guns and i mean how in case we have to do have to go to war you know just keep our little reserve 

Recording: (7101/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (7102/ 9621) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (7103/ 9621) 
yeah it it is difficult  

Recording: (7104/ 9621) 
and 

Recording: (7105/ 9621) 
not really i mean yeah there is a little flow but 

Recording: (7106/ 9621) 
we are just like pre marital sex i mean there was no way i would ever discuss anything like that ever with her i mean that was just something that you did not 

Recording: (7107/ 9621) 
we do not know who is in the airplane and there there are c planes that do come in out of there 

Recording: (7108/ 9621) 
they probably would have been about seniors in high schoolers though 

Recording: (7109/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (7110/ 9621) 
is pretty much deliver papers go to class wrestling sleep 

Recording: (7111/ 9621) 
does it 

Recording: (7112/ 9621)

Recording: (7113/ 9621) 
and that they are not willing to do that for gifted students 

Recording: (7114/ 9621) 
absolutely 

Recording: (7115/ 9621) 
uh and i had been there three four days in friday at breakfast one morning henry said well we have not talked about clinton and the upheachman yet and i said henry because he is a republic and i said i do not even wanna go there the light i said i do not even think we we wanna get involved in that conversation he says well at least they can understand you are saying that but i thought you you know i want to tell you where i am he said when this whole thing started i sat down and wrote everyone of my uh new jersey representatives all of my senators and all of the congress people in new jersey and told them that i will never ever in my life vote republican again because of the way this is has played out i mean this is a republican a lifelong republican because i will always now vote democrat because this is just so stupid in such a waste of my my time the country is time the country is money uh when there are better things to be dealing with and a lot of republicans felt that way you ought to be really extreme right wing to feel other than that  except here in central ohio  

Recording: (7116/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (7117/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7118/ 9621) 
i think it would help i do i am against religion in school i just do not think they should push that on people 

Recording: (7119/ 9621) 
um originally on the more side 

Recording: (7120/ 9621) 
people who that just uh really want to teach as opposed to like i do not know why other people like even going into teaching at all you know but um i think i would have just making it more like not so impersonal not so this is you know you do this to get this certain grades like you do this to learn this because it is interesting as opposed to like and i do not know i think it is like there is a lot of things that it is more compulsive education is weird like being forced to take this costs like i think that if i i mean it is good be enforceded to take abroad like a liberal arts thing because like you do not know what you i want to do so it is like if like you hate math and you do not take it at all but then you decide you want to do something to do something to math then you are like screwed like can not go back 

Recording: (7121/ 9621) 
i do not know to that much detail but most of the time it comes down to the lack of uh knowing your children are going to react and certain things uh what it is uh i do not know details or thing other than the fact that they were it seemed like they are not inb is going on uh with be very difficult um i think um let us let us be let us reverse if you say okay i am going to give up this life here and go to the third world live or or less too less me less reverse busting hey okay up around arlington you live northwest side one she could only live on the east side

Recording: (7125/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (7126/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7127/ 9621) 
you could argue both of those too but i mean personally i would say that is just teaching them more than what they need to know i i i think that is a way to do much 

Recording: (7128/ 9621) 
oh well it is not every sunday anymore but it was for a long time it was for a long time 

Recording: (7129/ 9621)

just pretty much that if you ask for forgiveness for goodness is granted whatever 

Recording: (7140/ 9621) 
um it was a little bit but at the same time i mean it was always a long time ago i mean i do not know how how far in the past you have to go for things to be considered a problem of something coming up again um i mean as long as he is not did not have any history of being like an addicted user or anything like that i mean i i can not say it really bothers me too much 

Recording: (7141/ 9621) 
and my husband is black 

Recording: (7142/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7143/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (7144/ 9621) 
i used to tell you what and everything that is the problem to be outside you know 

Recording: (7145/ 9621) 
you go to right right well i started going to sunday school when i was five or six years old 

Recording: (7146/ 9621) 
and that just something like that you need you need to the state 

Recording: (7147/ 9621) 
yeah he is up there too the old guy beard and a twed jacket you know it is pretty cool and uh they said most you know most of the students they are now even from delaware 

Recording: (7148/ 9621) 
they had this thing about um the nurse said that there have been studies done where babies that have been breast have higher i use 

Recording: (7149/ 9621)

Recording: (7153/ 9621) 
or put you in peek or something you know if there is any problem between students i do not even think they they they never would sit down with the students and have them talk it out you know they might send them to peek or something 

Recording: (7154/ 9621) 
i 

Recording: (7155/ 9621) 
well you have to 

Recording: (7156/ 9621) 
so um there is from what i hear one of the experienced kids was in a car with a drunk person had quite an experience with it 

Recording: (7157/ 9621) 
oh they are very good they call i usually just call and then i walk down and by the time i get there the subject ready 

Recording: (7158/ 9621) 
the problem is lack commitment the lack of commitment and i am not saying hey there is an issue for you you can not be a male oh yeah you want to do the operation i can not be if you know yeah they want to well why not be happy what you are god made you what you are why not make you the complete person you are and not strife or something you can not be 

Recording: (7159/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (7160/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (7161/ 9621) 
it is a real different thing i mean you can understand why it would be more pleasant for him to be at work all those hours when you know you have these little babies cry and all this stuff going on but he used to always he would come home from work and then go back to work after they were in bed so that i would not have to deal with it the whole time 

Recording: (7162/ 9621) 
um but good luck it back 

Recording: (7163/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (7164/ 9621) 
it is 

Recording: (7165/ 9621) 
i would like to see that implemented something like that in the united states that would be a neat thing you know because like i know like iron boundaries and uh from like like the lower paying jobs like they hire people that are a literate and things like that and they can not they give pay checks out on thursdays because everyone will call off on fridays because they will go out and get drunk i do not know what they do with their pay checks i know that is a big big problem 

Recording: (7166/ 9621) 
you know when i knew about age twelve thirteen  luckily i was not that early but uh i think once they start you know like sixth grade they really should relate to them 

Recording: (7167/ 9621) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (7168/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (7169/ 9621) 
and and it it is kind of weird because he when i went from middle school to high school it was like a big growing up period and i see them like what are you doing that for 

Recording: (7170/ 9621) 
right tuesdayay wednesday and thursday every night 

Recording: (7171/ 9621) 
now they are oh that is that is that she probably likes them well they were they were like her green kids so that is 

Recording: (7172/ 9621) 
yeah that that is one of the drawbacks 

Recording: (7173/ 9621) 
no i knew i would not change my mind on that either i am pretty strong willed about that 

Recording: (7174/ 9621) 
but uh everybody in my family is mechanical in quite 

Recording: (7175/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (7176/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7177/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7178/ 9621) 
i would get more people asking me for that and the mean it turns out pretty nice to make end about ten or eleven bucks an hour 

Recording: (7179/ 9621) 
yeah i do not think i could vote for a violent president i could vote for a president that made some mistakes with their personal life 

Recording: (7180/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (7181/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7182/ 9621) 
well i thought it went the way it was supposed to go  

Recording: (7183/ 9621) 
oh before they just drink 

Recording: (7184/ 9621) 
and he could see uh an assuming he is educated not stupid otherwise he would not be a man is rate could see that that person did that 

Recording: (7185/ 9621)

and he is very opinionated and it is interesting when he talks about uh anything he loves to talk about politics and social issues and that sort of thing uh you can tell that he is the thought is the thought about it and has you know clearly a what he is stances on it and he is very a particular about it uh sometimes it his responsible are not mature but he is nineteen 

Recording: (7203/ 9621) 
s only time for money yeah 

Recording: (7204/ 9621) 
well obviously i sort of surrounded that because i have been you know i spent a lot of time there since then i think had i only studied there for a semester or a quarter i would have come back with a completely different attitude but i was there for a whole year so the first few months we are a little bit difficult but then you know after that you know you just sort of you know get to the point where you just kind of uh you know laugh at off and just think uh here we go again and then 

Recording: (7205/ 9621) 
some ideal ideas about it so i am i figure it is something i should know about so  

Recording: (7206/ 9621) 
a dog which one is different uh moreso the law and a parent they are in the middle east and they will leave a prior uh my parents uh being able to handle those children so yes doing those things you know see for somebody else is from or somebody else is whatever uh because a doctorate in means that i can not have any children or i see a child over here that needs help and here you are reaching out out to your friend is neighbor you are not just forgetting about it and let the welfare somebody take care of them and let them go down the drain and i think that that is what a adoption is and and you are really accepting this responsibility in that stuff and when you are trying and willing to have oh some people will probably argue about this but i am sorry if god did not mean that i can see even have my own child why should i try to plant somebody else is inside i mean i would rather go out and see this other child that really needs needs help and adopt that baby because you can see them and you can help them and you are already aware to a certain extent of what jeans they might have inherited and what problems you might be getting sometimes you do not do right later on you will find out but still you can go back and you can find a parent and i do not know whether they are going to be able to trace these jeans back and say you know later or what something happens to this child you are having and find out well what did they inherited over here but if you have adopted a child you can go back and you can find it out and help the child better 

Recording: (7207/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7208/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (7209/ 9621)

Recording: (7210/ 9621) 
well we do not want to know she is the only one that wants to do her her uh boyfriend he does not want to know either so they are decided that she could not go and find out the sake of it because she could not keep us on the street yeah so so anyhow we do not we just do not know 

Recording: (7211/ 9621) 
um i do not know if there could be there are certain programs different community based programs getting but again those are my values of those and say it is doing the kids into a church to base program if they can not be there putting them with um families home friends that you know and try to to look after them giving them the kinds they need the ymca programs are wonderful they give them a structured activity to do where they are supervised but again those programs a lot of times cost money that the families do not have and it may not be their values to put them in those type of programs 

Recording: (7212/ 9621) 
german yeah 

Recording: (7213/ 9621) 
i do not think we need eight months then we need to start the campaign even a year before the primary it is just too long um people start tune out and there is only so much you can say and it is like again it is 

Recording: (7214/ 9621) 
and i do not agree with that either 

Recording: (7215/ 9621) 
i thought i would expect that from dogs i mean yeah a dog can probably get away with that kind of stuff but in broad daylight 

Recording: (7216/ 9621) 
i know i know i do not i mean i started 

Recording: (7217/ 9621) 
well i had a driveer down here last time so  she is gonna come back our way to the  i am just getting we wanted to get something to eat i drive to raheim so 

Recording: (7218/ 9621) 
right and i would like 

Recording: (7219/ 9621) 
when in the fifties and sixties you very seldom saw black people on tv and then you started seeing a couple of black people on tv and then there was the getversians and although i found the getvers sons offensive in many ways because it was stereotypical and made fun of of of black people in many ways and retrospect it was trend setting and what it did and and even in putting blacks in uh advertisements on tv young kids saw them uh and and saw those ads and saw those tv programs and so it became a a part of everyday life and the more you see something the more it becomes more acceptable to maybe that is having an in effect maybe fifty years from now we will look back on those tv programs and think they were trend setting instead of stereotypical um but i am sure it does have uh some influence because i think it it it it was not the only thing that had an influence but it was one of the little pieces of the puzzle that that helps i think matthew shepherd helped also 

Recording: (7220/ 9621) 
right i think teaching band might be fun because i think you only ever got a satisfaction or unsatisfiedly in band in had mostly to do with whether you were there  whether you were well behaved yeah and whether you are trying to play your instrument  i i do not think we ever got a is in season  yeah 

Recording: (7221/ 9621)

island 

Recording: (7229/ 9621)

Recording: (7230/ 9621) 
cat goes by 

Recording: (7231/ 9621) 
um the reason that it was one of the best years of my life was it is an incredibly beautiful setting and the people that came to participate in that were very very high people and it was and of course young people but they were incredibly idealistic and incredibly searching for answers in uh i mean their questions and their conversations talk about opinions  as a matter of fact that that is the only thing that i felt difficult about about living there was they would be asking all these incredible questions and i would be trying to do the dishes or something money like that it is like i do not want to do the dishes i just want to answer the question 

Recording: (7232/ 9621) 
they are supposed to be none physically possible goes against the first law of physics but i saw it happen

Recording: (7239/ 9621) 
um it is considered urban but because it is north back area and we play like a lot of like the inner city like in backering schools but in my opinion it is aurbia like but we have the we have the big city problem it is like there is a lot of drugs and i think that is just because the building is olds and no one really takes pride in it and then it is two thousand people 

Recording: (7240/ 9621)

Recording: (7287/ 9621) 
bring what is in your heart out and sometimes you will say stuff and it does not even make sense but you say and it brings it out and that is what it is for so i mean it is uh it is a struggle understanding that and uh uh i made it through all four rounds this time and uh even sat up which was the first time um it is a struggle but it uh it is necessary for the way i follow if it does especially for men women have a pure of vacation every month 

Recording: (7288/ 9621) 
at this point i i stopped for a moment and i am just like so nobody can think their divorce was so important that i need this it down to be with it because i i obviously i i i have a curiosity that something lack is not is on is a foot and so okay i sit down uh your your father kills himself this morning and oh and then there is like a sort of a wide out period there so you know getting like decent details on on wooded to i do not actually think anything because i do not hurt i think mostly it was me and my sister on my lap and me smelling my sister is white stink here because it smell in the cigarette smoke for some reason so white stinking hair white because i was growing into it and um and then more time passes so some in in determined length of time later um i i look over at the police officer who is standing on one side and the cop is are there basically to make sure i do not freak out and then finallyunk in i was like the cop isia here so you do not freak i am like well i am not really in any danger breaking out am i and you look at this so i was like oh a trickie if it looked like you would never know that is why the cops are here oh okay well they have worked more so well i am like okay so i looked at a friend upstairs and i was not able to put anything more than that and it did not come out anywhere near that well 

Recording: (7289/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (7290/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (7291/ 9621) 
um she is getting away from my parents for a while you know and it is kind of good for me just to be away it is probably the experience me learning doing my own laundry and stuff i eat still bad about it and now in a sudden i do not care really 

Recording: (7292/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7293/ 9621) 
all this other stuff 

Recording: (7294/ 9621) 
i know well you get you get to take advantage of it for lay overs and stuff 

Recording: (7295/ 9621) 
their day care oh i do not know it is tough i think really i believe more in that large corporations need to have some kind of day care offered it is just there is not that many people anymore that can afford to have a one income family i mean you know we could do it you know but you know we would not live as nice as we do we would not have as nice a cars as we do you know we would struggle a little more so so it is a toss up it is a real 

Recording: (7296/ 9621) 
well he he is yeah he taught math but they had to general curriculum just like he taught seventh grade they gave him math science um supposedly social studies and all this stuff that i mean it was just it was very poorly run to begin with so we would go out and try and find books for the kids i did not know if you heard that they he had not bought them books and so we had to buy them and uh i mean they got reimbursed but it was just ridiculous so they were trying to do anything they could and just to keep their jobs and keep the school 

Recording: (7297/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (7298/ 9621) 
she was like oh my god what did we do like my grandmother is name was all if when i was born and my dad said why she looks just like your mother to my mom and i have turned out to do everything that she did i have turned out to teach she was a teacher i have turned out to be you know real good in the kitchen and baking and i do like crafts like she did knitting and crocheting and i do that but i am sure glad they did not name me all of 

Recording: (7299/ 9621) 
no just both having to work there 

Recording: (7300/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (7301/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7302/ 9621) 
yeah the one thing they have done is they have put on bigger airplanes because it used to be you know like a uh say uh seven thirty seven would go from here to new york city and now it is a seven fifty seven so that adds more seats so instead of because i wait when i first got there i could not understand it at always you it when it was like christmas time or something it would just you drive up in the parking lot was just full of cars and you are like oh boy 

Recording: (7303/ 9621) 
nothing i mean his mom and his dad are cool and 

Recording: (7304/ 9621) 
and poor people can not do that um so after all of a sudden on with her case she was left with about a million dollars and then out of that million the attorney in the firm got a third plus she had to pay office expenses so really she was probably let with only about three hundred thousand dollars which have used wisely okay maybe she could have but it sounded to me like she did not have a money problem anyway she was a corporate person uh but a very stupid person um so i mean that is basically my my down with the legal system i you know i have i have got a person right now that owes me five hundred dollars that i wanted to take this law claims court even got the call uh a canceled check to prove it and everything but you know uh and when i look at what the alternative is which is subjecting myself to uh unfairness uh even though i feel i got a concrete in a way you know those are the ones i mean i would have to pay an attorney in that she was running am fine right now a hundred and forty five dollars an hour 

Recording: (7305/ 9621) 
it is his dad his dad is dead and his dad  

Recording: (7306/ 9621) 
he takes care of his so to me that is more important

uh nothing for a while i do not want to do anything until past january you know because i have i like i said it since nineteen seventy four i have never had thanksgiving christmas or new years off without having to work either a seven to three or a three to eleven you know and it is like i i figure i deserve it you know at about time i get to not eat uh thanksgiving dinner at ten thirty in the morning so i can go to go to work at noon or something you know or or open the christmas presents uh you know at five oclock in the afternoon because i work christmas days so you know i think it my 

Recording: (7313/ 9621)

Recording: (7315/ 9621)

Recording: (7316/ 9621) 
we had uh my husband and i had just some herbsbs you know partially and chives and some baseball rose mary that type of thing 

Recording: (7317/ 9621) 
uh pretty good he liked it a lot but it was a big change from the california school big change uh he liked it a lot i do not know if you are familiar with fort worth haze it is uh it is in college prep uh i do prep um they call it an alternative school it is called bagged school in most places uh it is college prep with an emphasis on the arts and they are some career programs there so it was a good good for him 

Recording: (7318/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (7319/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7320/ 9621) 
yeah lower equipment 

Recording: (7321/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7322/ 9621) 
um in a fight and they just said they we want to be um looked at it is just other kids you know in high school but yet when they wear make up and they suspect their hair and they have all these pure things you know it is like they they do not want to be like everybody else 

Recording: (7323/ 9621) 
yeah right right the the amount of money that is spent is just uh i could just can not imagine you know millions and millions have been spent already hundreds of millions and it is just starting 

Recording: (7324/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7325/ 9621) 
not since the new year started we have not been i like scary um i think he is in just scary action you know late 

Recording: (7326/ 9621) 
yeah they they have it um 

Recording: (7327/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (7328/ 9621) 
uh i do not know i do not remember 

Recording: (7329/ 9621) 
i mean i think he is done some kinds of things that whole thing about uh as far as like your student loan and being able to get into that that just helps me you know and anything you know on this that as far as some of the issues go i think that that i feel pretty similar to the way he does um some of his foreign policy things i think have gone pretty recently but i mean i think i do not i do not know i mean i i do not know so if it really if you really feel like the that whole health care thing which nothing ever happened with really you know and i think these people have a lot of really great ideas but they do not they do not ever really put anything in action it is kind of skied along you know and i do not know if there is anything so i can say that was a wonderful thing that you said that i feel very affected by it uh economy is fine i mean so it is not they he he is doing a horrible job but i do not really know how much he is actually doing you know and i think that unfortunately he spend a lot of your time trying to get out of out of personal issues that you have got yourself into and you can not really focus us on anything that is that is positive that you want to do for for their country and i think i think it is just too bad because i feel like if i was president you know i said i why have you president but you know you would have three or four things that you would think we are very important you would you would hire a lot of other people to take care of the other areas and people that were very comedyous that you feel like they would actually be able to accomplish them things and you have really worked you can get some stuff done you know and i do not know if it is if it is just because you if it is just because you know you have to get agreement from all the other all everybody else in government before you can pass anything or why you know why do not things get taken care of i mean there is so many different issues that people want to look at and they end up focusing on things they fill up more if you know just like that i guess thing in the whole world you know and and there is so many other things that i think you could be looking at that are that are important i just i do not know maybe i mean i do not i do not i am not real up on everything that is been done that i guess it just kind of seems like i wish people would be a little bit more focused in and you would be able to say you know this is what there is these three things that i think are really important that i am really going to work to make sure that they had taken care of and and i do not i just think people kind of lot it i said well this is it is like this you know well see what we can kind of do about it and then we will you know 

Recording: (7330/ 9621) 
well see my my husband would do that though it is so bizarre because it is i do not know what i i honestly do not i think that is where his brain is completely like he i think i get to make all the decisions at my house about discipline and about what people can do and can not do and we all understand this and it is perfectly fine and he says i am not a good judge of that you will have to check what because my son well my son was like eleven he let him come to campus with his game boating friends i said where are they oh they said they were going down on i said on campus how am i doing body you know he is not allowed down there

Recording: (7332/ 9621) 
and we know that the results could be death than like in it in it is an aggressive an aggressive thing one side of all video grass or one would obviously because you can not have two uh to aggressive things uh uh naturally one would be aggressive and then one would be aggressive in its response you can not you know what i mean so in like a state of war it was like that so in that context i think but like in the same context i feel that it would be wrong for us to children to kill civilian because they did not um they did not decide to become a combat and so if you are if you are a combat and then you make that decision or you are drafted which that that is kind of like making the decision in the sense that you are part of that society that got you drafted so if you choose before that society then i mean that is a little shadeier but still if you are if you both make the the desire to do it then so like if i were drafted i think i would fight i am sure i would fight for the country you know but i do not think i would go i you know i just do not feel the need to go on a rampage or anything 

Recording: (7333/ 9621)

Recording: (7342/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (7343/ 9621) 
i always wish somebody would redo a survey on that and saying it back in sixty five or whatever what is the difference between what they teaching them then and what they teach them now is it really that or is it just our imagination they just do not remember enough yeah that seems more to me and computers really have helped it 

Recording: (7344/ 9621)

and there is all kinds of things going on i mean you if you had the money you can use something every night  it is 

Recording: (7378/ 9621) 
maybe because she says the less americans are different 

Recording: (7379/ 9621) 
and they were wondering why we were making such a big deal out of it and pretty much all the other problems well they were not really too many other problems i mean the economy is doing really well and foreign relations are always shakey but they are getting a little bit better

Recording: (7388/ 9621) 
and they have excellent 

Recording: (7389/ 9621) 
well it is like the i 

Recording: (7390/ 9621) 
kind of 

Recording: (7391/ 9621) 
you know and it was in the but do not get me wrong he told me he was going to have me i locked up for child abuse so i would do the house in the car and check them downtown and took them inside and told them to tell them people because they are going to lock him up 

Recording: (7392/ 9621) 
you know but you know kids they have to learn these things on their own i mean he is twenty two i still consider him a kid but they have to learn these things on their own you know when you go to the look for a power but what you need to look for or what you need to check out you know are you going to be able to afford it and everything that goes with it and have a work study job  you know 

Recording: (7393/ 9621) 
i do not think so i do not think they did um but there was this other guy my mom was talking about the other day i do not know which he is seen it on i guess he had did something like that and you know he was just listening they did a like an interview with him and uh told him how much you know things he did like he did this and that and i guess he broke into bank once or something like that got some accounts or something like that and think oh yeah that is 

Recording: (7394/ 9621) 
pull out 

Recording: (7395/ 9621) 
immediy type 

Recording: (7396/ 9621) 
i am really saying much new whether they have a more compact time they could be so i would like the season see the time reduced the convention used to be interesting because they debated the platform that is all settled now and it is all settled now and it is just sort of a you know this unabreation type stuff well that is not interesting how it could change them who the primary is like to be 

Recording: (7397/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (7398/ 9621) 
yeah um well i was raised most of my life in ashland it is about ten minutes north of manesville though i am and uh i uh we moved there we moved there from man is field so i have been living in the man is vacation area for 

Recording: (7399/ 9621) 
and i think she yeah she will 

Recording: (7400/ 9621) 
hm 

Recording: (7401/ 9621) 
there was an indam story about that i think it was i do not know it was harper is magazine or what it was in a a a significant magazine where they had uh made a study of the new york situation and i found that quite interesting and very very impressive uh as a matter of fact whatever was i remember sending it into the uh city council uh uh update you know just addressed 

Recording: (7402/ 9621) 
they she is you know half naked and she is should be a central somewhere you know and those are little yeah disney movies cartoons i mean when you look at that you see it everywhere and it is really scary um but nobody is doing anything about it that i can see and they do not really see it concerned but like i said wait till the generation starts growing up wait till those little kids that we have put all those things in their head grows up then they will think wow we should have done something and well i am i am scared i hope i do not live real long  it is it is scary well and then the guy that um i do not even remember what his name was he got a drunk driving charge a judge he was a judge now he is out he went back to work on monday 

Recording: (7403/ 9621) 
highly skilled or trained in that area i mean you can not really do a simple sort of screening and these are good and these are bad and again as i mentioned previously i think it is more to do with maybe being aware of the interaction of you know the different students with each other and i mean if it was as bad as they claimed it to be or as it appears to be and i mean you are you are never going to get rid of all of that because they are always different groups and different looks but i can not help but thinking that if it was bad enough that you would do something like that that you know aids have been more than just you know sort of normal jobs versus whatever so i think it should be more i do not know i mean even you know i went to uh private catholic high schools but even there you know there was you know a a sense of that and i mean some of the things that went on should definitely not have been going on and that was only on a very small lake they were eighty six people in my graduating class you know and i mean this is a high school with like several hundred students that just happened to it so 

Recording: (7404/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (7405/ 9621) 
you know i i said to myself because i had post part of them depression with my third and fourth child and i thought what good am i going to be to these children if i am not able to take care of them so the decision was that after the fourth child we would practice birth control so uh and i felt comfortable with that 

Recording: (7406/ 9621) 
not easily them  not quite they  not really 

Recording: (7407/ 9621) 
no sun light you know that and they do not give them they keep it warm and then he is not allowed sheets or raises or you know other an electric rais so he can not kill himself so you are just stock there is nothing you could do all day for forty years or however eventually it naturally dies and that to me would be they got to me is actually like that has to be worse they in just a agony in the and i think you would have to go on saying that there is really so much you i am down for board games or something but like you can not then you can hear human voice because i think it is something like that was reading the script was like you are dead to the world for uh the worst that you can do and so the world season you know what i mean so that would be rough they would be real rough and so obviously he would want to um i like they say like now like people would observe him he is like songs to himself and he reads the bible like every day and but like i do not know they would be strange if he is such a horrible thing to go through i could not imagine being like in the room for like a few days 

Recording: (7408/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7409/ 9621) 
sixteen 

Recording: (7410/ 9621) 
a couple or three times too but on the phone and everything and then i sit there said well i am in the you know you can call me every name in a book to whatever heck you want to but i am scared of my other so 

Recording: (7411/ 9621) 
just one school so that is how many there was there 

Recording: (7412/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (7413/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7414/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7415/ 9621) 
right yeah yeah that is very true 

Recording: (7416/ 9621) 
let us watch seven and eight 

Recording: (7417/ 9621) 
we well sort of and kind of yes we were i mean we dated in high school but he ended up going to problem with somebody else and we i mean we we went to kid we went kindergarten all the way through and my sister and his sister were the same age and my mom and his mom are camp fire leaders together in the whole bit and then we did not really date in um college kind of really did not get together at all freshman year he did go to school here and then uh as i said i spent for ohio state and then i went into i called david is in the sporting goods door to um buy his home suit my sophomore year and he was a cash year there 

Recording: (7418/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (7419/ 9621) 
nope i i i would not i will i will not send them to a college public school but an alternative school i will send them to um private school i do not i would if i had the money to tell you the truth i would let definitely but i know i could not afford it that is why i have never thought about it really 

Recording: (7420/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (7421/ 9621) 
yeah stay away from salt uh sod and stuff like that pop uh coffee i do not know if you have probably never on on drink coffee i drink a lot of popdue uh like pork products 

Recording: (7422/ 9621) 
wow that is great 

Recording: (7423/ 9621) 
and a lot of times unions uh they actually see actually see that to a like to production and to like the actual individual needs of the members of the union because the if the unit becomes powerful you can feel free to call off and things like that and they that that can actually make it worse because then the corporations see these lazy the lazy union as a representative of of these workers so they are more apt to go outside 

Recording: (7424/ 9621) 
yeah that would not work  

Recording: (7425/ 9621) 
umhum right 

Recording: (7426/ 9621) 
i know that 

Recording: (7427/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (7428/ 9621) 
but i do not think it is bad 

Recording: (7429/ 9621) 
so you know one day uh it was a really bad day i had gone like tole soclock home with somebody and came back and you know i guess that i had had evening to eat the entire day and i was like it was like midnight and i got home and i thought oh i am too hungry you know to i am too tired and hungry and i just thought i am not making anything so i just went to bed and uh a guy knocked on my door which he lives upstairs in the apartment above me and he talked to me or younger and i would not answer well it was a real cheap apartment he took a credit card and punished the uh the door and all of and 

Recording: (7430/ 9621) 
actually i wore out 

Recording: (7431/ 9621) 
is that right the lot of all of these are these like little well down in high spots you know like uh just trying to keep them like a like a a seek it away from the taurus 

Recording: (7432/ 9621) 
gavegave homosexual and all those 

Recording: (7433/ 9621) 
a few times they they did a specifically say uh homosexuality but i mean there were other things that they would cover i mean it is not like it is just in all i just in all i just saw it on being getting anything like that 

Recording: (7434/ 9621) 
within her her life they she she does more with the children because most of them live here you know our children are all away so 

Recording: (7435/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (7436/ 9621) 
i do not know i mean i think it is kind of ridiculous for kids to pay since you have got them you know or if they get caught doing it like d sales my all my cousins went to the new sales and if they got shut caught you and um they have their pay 

Recording: (7437/ 9621) 
yeah well like i mean high school schools i was been really easy in my in my high school was really easy like i never really felt like challenge is doing remotely by anything like i mean it was it is so like high school was kind of like a joke you know it was real fun and everything you know just to like that really have to do pretty much of anything you know and like um and like so college is a a little bit different i mean it was like a little bit more challenging i mean it is basically the same thing in high school you should have less time to do the material you know so it is just like as opposed to i mean three weeks to doing the paper and doing it the night before you have three days to do it and you should still do it the night before it is just like i do not know i thought i just kind of like found out like that i really do not like school and like i ever want to go back and like having to take math them to take math classes again like i just like is not really my thing like when too like i always knew that this it would be like this you always have to take basic classes but like i was a history major and so it is like i do not care about math at all and like anything that i would do would be humanities or like so it is like 

Recording: (7438/ 9621) 
umhum an all white jury 

Recording: (7439/ 9621) 
well i 

Recording: (7440/ 9621) 
and the questions are not easy i mean i mean uh i doubt if i could pass some of them i mean i probably could pass the citizenship in the in the english and maybe the science because i like science when i keep up on that stuff but i doubt if i could pass them math because i do not teach math and i do not use math that much other than just normal you know add subtract wonderful 

Recording: (7441/ 9621) 
uh i think they lost they go to the state lost because they just out there renting and leaving and after a while got out of hand i 

Recording: (7442/ 9621) 
bassacoustics really 

Recording: (7443/ 9621) 
that is different 

Recording: (7444/ 9621) 
i do not think we take up huge amount and then uh we get some of the service through or not as well which is i think it is just a plain openous they give us a dog name and the name and the lot 

Recording: (7445/ 9621) 
like uh right now their biggest campaign is uh the some elementary school i believe and oh i think it was a high school in marion we have built on um in old weapon depot until like leukeous rhythm and so like that is their main campaign now is going to form the public and trying uh get that changed they have also done other things uh other they they do anything doing the environment uh like exposure uh things like that so 

Recording: (7446/ 9621) 
over on an adjoining hill oh about half a mile away i guess and he was getting even for the day before 

Recording: (7447/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7448/ 9621) 
and if it is not a necessity i will have to forward it right now well a lot of them want the necessities they also want some of the extras and in order do that both act to work well constantly well who is really raising the kids if they are lucky they have got a loving grandparents ninety nine times out of a hundred i do not know if that is a good statistic it is the babysitter is or you know these places it is not a babysitter it is a babysitter school or something like that and that is not the same loving cutling atmosphere that it had when mom was home and able to watch these kids and i think that that is one of the things they can change plus the fact that they change the stupid tv programs because that is a terrible influence of a lot of kids is taking over their life is that it is not that now it is worse yet the kids are on the internet now that is even worse because now you can not even hear what they are getting into at least on tv you go walk in the street and turn it off and you can go in i guess and see what is wrong the internet on the on the same to say it they are not that anymore but i think those are all really they can be good influences if they have got the right program the right person they are talking to but too many times it is the other way around 

Recording: (7449/ 9621) 
 yes exactly 

Recording: (7450/ 9621) 
i hate my my last name is terrible i hate my last name 

Recording: (7451/ 9621) 
well muggings on the subway or stuff you know just in general 

Recording: (7452/ 9621) 
just do not talk about other people talking just general things that i think you should take for granted 

Recording: (7453/ 9621) 
uh relax uh get a a dead end job that does not come home with me uh try and pay off my debt and maybe make a little bit so uh i i grass go yeah but also enjoy all the things i did not get to do 

Recording: (7454/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (7455/ 9621) 
well and they had to cover their i know all of that but i do not think that is really been 

Recording: (7456/ 9621) 
or or somebody or or they will claim to i wasus to the same about as i walked out the door you know and it is a big line 

Recording: (7457/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (7458/ 9621) 
but i know people at the sleep on the outside and uh but not all of them are better into the better but they they are again they do not want to be a part of the quote unquote sheltered system you know uh standing in this open shoulder if you are away or something like that 

Recording: (7459/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (7460/ 9621) 
and there is lighting effects the extra blade is not the balls 

Recording: (7461/ 9621) 
yeah just so smart 

Recording: (7462/ 9621) 
i went to for grade school and for high school 

Recording: (7463/ 9621) 
or just to say this you know this is what i thought this that does that what that really says well here is a perfect example the other day my kids my six graders turned in papers on if i could be an animal here is the animal i would be and here is why and they had to research the animal they had like a month to do it and they had to pick an animal and tell about their feeding habits and their whether they travel in groups or alone and of what part of the world they mostly habitate what they eat all that okay perfect example one of my students wanted to say my animal that i pick lives mostly on vegetables and he could not figure out how to spell it so he went into the computer and he asked it and it gave him the word vested abuse 

Recording: (7464/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7465/ 9621) 
oh man 

Recording: (7466/ 9621) 
so um 

Recording: (7467/ 9621) 
than i 

Recording: (7468/ 9621) 
exist area i mean they could actually well yeah they could actually make it to where they could put homeless people or something speed them or something 

Recording: (7469/ 9621) 
the light news uh that is why i read it tend to read alternative newspapers and stuff because you do get a different perspective it it is probably just slanted but it is different the right 

Recording: (7470/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7471/ 9621) 
i think so because i 

Recording: (7472/ 9621) 
which is um which is actually a good place for her because a lot of those houses like right around the park of roses and those types of things you can get some that are older that need that need a lot of work but that is a pretty high to man area 

Recording: (7473/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (7474/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (7475/ 9621) 
okay that is why they do a lot of like biological studies is up everywhere okay i i have heard of it 

Recording: (7476/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (7477/ 9621) 
oh i you had women that work in the before you had women working before but selfdiscipline is a big family that is part of it selfdiscipline many things too easy for us oh we can not do without it you ever you ever try to work person i mean you really struggle to achieve something did it mean more to you than something that was given to you tell me 

Recording: (7478/ 9621) 
well i have a  maybe when i am i am a hundred i will have that figured out 

Recording: (7479/ 9621) 
then my sister lives in the middle of the past  nobody wants to  nobody wants to cut it  no grass yeah what is out there anyway come what is the cornstarch 

Recording: (7480/ 9621) 
because that is sort of what i found interesting there too i mean there are a lot of drives about that i remember um driving to germany with a couple of english friends and to visit some german friends there and we got there and it we would cut lost and all they think that took us way longer than it should have been a friend of the person that we were visiting said like oh why did you have to stop at every mcdonald is along the way and i was like i i do not even eat at mcdonald is you know and i was just you know and it was really mean it is like that it is not really a very good joke and that kind of thing came up quite frequently but you know i always said mcdonald is will not survive here if no one ate there and you can not tell me that everyone in there is american 

Recording: (7481/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (7482/ 9621) 
there well there is the whole thing about the police chief and then there is the whole thing about uh about the last the federal law against columbus 

Recording: (7483/ 9621) 
that is what we are concerned with you need to interact more people we need to interact more people every day of our life that is what we learn from we do not learn by giving things to people just like if you are uh a parent getting giving allowance you do not giving them the your kids uh money to do chores they normally expecting to do but you get them in addition to to develop more responsibility but we do not talk about responsibility on society they i i i dare are you saying we are in the heck they say public this is our bill of responsibility do you know where there is do we talk about responsibility now 

Recording: (7484/ 9621) 
yeah and it is uh it is not too bad because i they scratch off your ticket games 

Recording: (7485/ 9621) 
i just well but i did not understand as much to you probably  i just said like cool this is to what i needed to do to become an art major and i would go to my supervisor and they would tell me what to take and it was the art advisors but i did not really think i had to do anything especially i do not know about the poorfully old review and all that stuff and that was probably my own fault for not asking questions but so it took me a while and then i just kind of went to college and went on the mission then came back and so he just got accepted into that college but yeah 

Recording: (7486/ 9621) 
stuff like that and i think they even might have found like one or two guns so and that to me would just but my high school is two thousand people so i guess by sheer numbers one or three persons it would bring a gun 

Recording: (7487/ 9621) 
i do i am against religion in school i just do not think they should push that on people um you know i mean i do not think they should make people pray if they do not want to be for class or anything you know like that but as far as morals and the right thing to do in life and what is out there and you know most kids know what the wrong thing is but 

Recording: (7488/ 9621) 
i am on the computer at least six hours a day 

Recording: (7489/ 9621) 
that is surprising 

Recording: (7490/ 9621) 
does that makes sense 

Recording: (7491/ 9621) 
like just like like usedlike uh like uh um just how it is like one room that you like kind of living or whatever you know it is more like you know like the army or something you know like real simple and everything is uniformed like uh 

Recording: (7492/ 9621) 
and she just came here and they live with me a year ago so she could have her baby here 

Recording: (7493/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (7494/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (7495/ 9621) 
yeah i think that is probably you know i am i am not that familiar with it now but i think that they are getting better in in seeing the cracks and things like that that people have fall through 

Recording: (7496/ 9621) 
yeah  

Recording: (7497/ 9621) 
but i get the sense that if there are disciplined problems it is so hard to get anything done to solve them unless you know unless somebody brings a gun in ways around the school you know that the big thing now but just that you know it is just so hard to get anything done um and i think at that point the teachers get frustrated because they do not see the support across or through the administration if they do have if they they have to wait until something is pretty pretty regious before they before it is dealt with 

Recording: (7498/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7499/ 9621) 
i would be a lot happier 

Recording: (7500/ 9621) 
i actually joined the church in uh well i do not know six years ago about six years ago and they did a survey here at lsu and they were on them just asking people if they saw it that christ had visited america and there was a record of that account and if do i think that would be important and i just like believe i would think so yeah  and but i did not i was kind of hesitant i mean it took me a while that i read the book one women and i really prayed about it and took me about six months and and then i finally decided that i really liked it and it was what i had been wanting so that is how i decided 

Recording: (7501/ 9621) 
right because everything that has a coupon has tons of fat tons of sugar and is overpriced 

Recording: (7502/ 9621) 
yeah they yeah she moved in with him 

Recording: (7503/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7504/ 9621) 
it is all right 

Recording: (7505/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7506/ 9621) 
so indirectlyically it was a very bad reason that i came here but it worked out 

Recording: (7507/ 9621) 
blyed over weight people 

Recording: (7508/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (7509/ 9621) 
continue maryland money 

Recording: (7510/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (7511/ 9621) 
well not really they have a lot of uh religious beliefs on their own that they have had held onto because uh they who just have had nothing 

Recording: (7512/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7513/ 9621) 
i used to live up there too 

Recording: (7514/ 9621) 
well generally they have some area i do not think i have ever met the kid yet the special kid who has no area that he does an excel like once i had a six grade girl who still did not know her crime tables in sixth grade but she had a bevely stills offer a voice and in every single school production she was leadsingle i had a girl once that was all kind of middles and gymnastics at the state level it seems like when god takes away from you he gives something back i have had kids who that got every bad you can get in boy scouts and you know i mean there is usually something that they are really it might not be related to school but there is usually something that they are really really good at in some other area like there is swimming or or scouting or whatever so they you know but generally speaking they will attack a problem a totally different way than the norm and they will come up with much more creative solutions than the normal person with a hundred or ninety five iq yeah i have seen him long enough to know that and worked with him long enough to know that well like i have one boy who can not spell them he still spelled it t h i m and he took my computer apart the other day and adjusted something in the mother board and put it back together now at work 

Recording: (7515/ 9621) 
he uh trade rate whatever that means 

Recording: (7516/ 9621) 
and feed her and i go do not bother me i have had a bad day and i am tired you go watch tv and how are we raising children doing that you know you know and people say uh you have to have both those incomes because we have to do that they go why do you have to have house that is three hundred thousand dollars why do you have to have a brand new car you know is not life sacrificesices are are not you supposed to like do this for your children you know i mean i my children do not have everything they do not have a  you know my daughter has a car that goes to and it is twelve years old you know and i made her buy it i told her i said i will not buy you a car i said it you want it to buy it you have to buy it and i said when it is to buy it for maintenance you have to pay for it because she has to be responsible for it and she appreciates that you know and you know i admire her i mean she is the person i never was that age you know that is the you know and i i do not take full responsibility for that but 

Recording: (7517/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7518/ 9621) 
know about 

Recording: (7519/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (7520/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7521/ 9621) 
hm 

Recording: (7522/ 9621) 
but 

Recording: (7523/ 9621) 
i am going to get done with this i swear  

Recording: (7524/ 9621) 
with their cycle and that is the way the indians people we have been many of the women referred to it as they are on their moon because when the moon is out the moon is that sacred and there is that that life women have that uh gift of life that they can give uh men can not do that um there is just a lot there that uh you know women go through that purification every month so women really do not need as well but it is there for them and they do participate um 

Recording: (7525/ 9621) 
but it just depends upon it still comes back to who you are now 

Recording: (7526/ 9621) 
and we were staying at his grandpa and his grandpa would sit on the back porch and see all kinds of racial slurs towards black people 

Recording: (7527/ 9621) 
okay  

Recording: (7528/ 9621) 
oh yeah yes and uh they are kind of weird like that um once that of grandparents really i can not hear whoever says anything there is it said on the other side that they are a little bit more racist uh but at the same time i do not know they almost set up like a double standard for black people they are black people that they really like and i mean they are actually friends with some black people and they are black people that they do not like for whatever the reason may be and those are the people that they are racing towards i mean it is the same thing that goes with white people obviously they are white people that you can stand there are white people that are just obnoxious and you do not want to deal with um i mean it is basically the same thing right yeahoh yeah yeahyeah exactly uhhuhum i really do not think we did for the most part i can not say see any real big problems or anything like that that occurred just because of the sex you are or anything i think that probably would cause a bigger problem than the black president uh honestly um although i do not really see too many sex problems i definitely do see guys still being more like the decision making type and as being like the final say in things rather than women and i would see them having an authority figure that is being a woman is causing problems to them 

Recording: (7529/ 9621) 
umhum it is real well now 

Recording: (7530/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (7531/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7532/ 9621) 
and now the only thing that was really down there before i moved out was the lincoln lebec tower  the shortest one  but of course the university is just about the same in some ways the stadium and all that 

Recording: (7533/ 9621) 
oh yeah yeah we all get together we have to get a shelter house now somewhere because then nobody is house was big enough well and then we have so many little kids that it is great because uh we just go to a shelter inside and they have it you know like for christmas and things like that and they can run around the kids run around and 

Recording: (7534/ 9621) 
oh my 

Recording: (7535/ 9621) 
right no 

Recording: (7536/ 9621) 
oh yeah yeah i think what religion are you  oh that one it has all those uh going into those workout in real life christianity  yeah  

Recording: (7537/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7538/ 9621) 
oh well you doing that for oh 

Recording: (7539/ 9621) 
um not really because i think you knowyou and i do not think a lot of them at that stage are going to go out of their way to go and buy them so i do not think it is like oh i have a condom i am going to have sex i mean actually this is a very hot topic in england right now because they they have got the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in the world and i mean their stories everywhere about you know twelve year olds having babies and i mean there they have gone to distributing condums on play games which i do think is a little bit too much i think maybe having them available in their is office is one thing they are there you know they can go and and get some or something but i think actually like physically you know passing them out is a bad idea but demonstrating that kind of thing i think it is pretty important just you know because of the simple fact of the statistics that they are they are doing it so at least at the very at least they might as well be you know they have about it 

Recording: (7540/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (7541/ 9621) 
yeah she is almost in the family 

Recording: (7542/ 9621) 
because then you know what is something major happens that first and then what but i think at least for children especially because they have no means to to help themselves and like the parents obviously even if they are working a lot of times can not get health care for their children so i think at least for children how many actions happening children like they will always breaking arms and stuff 

Recording: (7543/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (7544/ 9621) 
i do not know anything about the stock parts oh man do not let the shirt fool you 

Recording: (7545/ 9621) 
and i think they are retired teachers or people on maybe the board at different school districts or i do not know well 

Recording: (7546/ 9621) 
sure 

Recording: (7547/ 9621) 
yeah the only thing i am going to do is maybe two weeks before i might get a hundred dollars from the bank machine and uh i have three cars so i probably have one of them full of gas and other than that it is like you know to me if you are say back one and i am honeys and january second people have all kinds of problems you and i are going to be the lasting stock of the corporate america and you really think you and i want to do that so to me nobody is going to have a problem because years they are going to go oh i remember back one you know you go get ten bucks and you get five hundred out of the machine but you know so who wants to do business nobody is going to do that you know you know maybe some little company i am that really does not you know have a big impact but i do not see where anything is going to happen at all you know 

Recording: (7548/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (7549/ 9621) 
but uh she likes the spirit child of the community over there and 

Recording: (7550/ 9621) 
you know if if it does not effect them it is not there and if they do not have to 

Recording: (7551/ 9621) 
they do not get i do not think they get federal funding i think they get a little bit from the ohio arts council and they they raise money from the businesses in the community plus we charge for tickets  for people to come and see us and sometimes we get a lot sometimes we do not get so many turns out the concerts we get the most the biggest audience for are the christmas concerts where we have children is choir  because 

Recording: (7552/ 9621) 
 no i am i am not really up on the coaching thing i mean anybody can coach a game that takes players to play the game 

Recording: (7553/ 9621) 
he wants to yeah 

Recording: (7554/ 9621) 
i think they have got more money i do not know if that necessarily makes them about our school uh i think a lot of it is it is it is really what you what as far as uh as a parent is what you expect your children to achieve in school and what they want to get out of it you know my my family my brothers and sisters they all went to public schools and and they took advanced ap classes and and they worked real hard and and they have got i think they have options 

Recording: (7555/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (7556/ 9621) 
okay where the few years ago there was this big fuss that you know we have got to close some schools so we did not you know in roman shopping it is you know just the way the population goes and roman shopping we can not afford to keep them all going so it is close and it just makes a big study and they target it is something to close well there is a big uproar from the people this kids went to that school like there will be whenever you close the schools to the board back down and change its money the next year they came out on the study saying they need more schools but there was not a money for it so there was a big fuss about that and two years later they came out with another study this is what they need to refurbish or not some schools close a couple and then knock some down and rebuild them and it is like every two years it is a different direction and in the second they are almost afraid to take a stand that somebody is not going to like well if you are going to shut a school down somebody is going to be really ticked off 

Recording: (7557/ 9621) 
yeah i run into that on it i think part of it was the high school at that time and i have gone to catholic schools all my life or whatever and obviously i have run into a lot more of the wealthier type people who who they just do not have time or do not have the interest and just pay people to do it 

Recording: (7558/ 9621) 
like like sometimes i think about people you know they call and and especially when i talk to the sometimes people call in and i i talk you know i get the same people every once in a while it is specific like there is people that is real specific weird names or something that i can remember i will they will call back and on if you think about them it is like uh i have this you know like we had this weird like five minute relationship or something like that like that every couple of weeks or something and it is like i think about what their life is like and what they are actually like in the you know it is like it is real weird it is like i do not know but yeah get everybody 

Recording: (7559/ 9621) 
at the beginning he did perfectly but now he is doing this i went up at four oclock kind of thing and give him a bottle that goes back to sleep but you know i do not want to walk all the way down to the big bottle for four oclock they can not see you feel in my way through the hallways and stuff 

Recording: (7560/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (7561/ 9621) 
oh really uhhuh 

Recording: (7562/ 9621) 
right and and it sometimes that opens uh the person up because a child they are so innocent and you can not help but love them and i know my mom had a big problem with the whole inner ratio 

Recording: (7563/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (7564/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7565/ 9621) 
yeah he was he is always be really like that he is got his yeah  

Recording: (7566/ 9621) 
actually um i went back i came back to iowa um in let us see ninety three through ninety five and got a teaching certificate in science for secondary science and i taught for a year uh at a small school in lakers or catholic high school down there and uh left there uh part of if it was my fault i was not very good at discipline in the classroom so that is probably one of the biggest problems i had but uh 

Recording: (7567/ 9621) 
yeah i just had to leave me here we have been best friends for so many years  

Recording: (7568/ 9621) 
yeah that is interesting though because i think i think that that my whole i i mean i always still i still feel like i am just 

Recording: (7569/ 9621) 
well it was not i was in management for about thirteen fourteen years and it was not bad where i was before uh mismanagement was it was the whole department it was uh i do not know what it was the people they were always arguing and fighting it was just the whole atmosphere like up that place and it was just people that i known for years and got in the long well with were just they were different when they went in there they just changed it was just it was just not a good place to work 

Recording: (7570/ 9621) 
now that does make an extra work for the teacher but it gives him a shot he usually will answer the concept he will usually answer the main stuff that he knows and if you only grade him on that he might have a shot at a sierra be i mean there is all kind of ways to modify uh give a a copy of another student is no it is if his or crummy any they can not study from them we even have a thing in our school that it is it looks just like notebook paper and it is got the three holes in the lines and every teacher has a stack of it on their desk but it is ncr you know the two copies 

Recording: (7571/ 9621) 
so we throw the book away onto some of these other guys i mean they throw the key away onto some of these guys and you know we want to set them and an an example and you know this one guy had one d u i two years ago so we really have he is got to be in jail for five years you know then this judge i mean he is got probably ten years of history with drugs and alcohol and he is still and he is still attached  monday morning he goes to work 

Recording: (7572/ 9621) 
it is in the accounting department 

Recording: (7573/ 9621) 
you know happen like in the same year eighty eight you know so but uh but they are pretty tough but i just did not deal with it brought it up at all you know they still would not go to get counseling well i probably should have got marriage counseling but but i refuse to do that too so i did not think i had a problem with it she was not worth while 

Recording: (7574/ 9621)

Recording: (7575/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (7576/ 9621)

Recording: (7579/ 9621) 
i know i do not 

Recording: (7580/ 9621)

Recording: (7591/ 9621) 
and not that that changed my opinion up her uh but back then and nobody would talk about it and you know i just think in today is world we need to bring subjects like that out no one because there is so many people who are a shame about things and they should not be a shame because it is a lifestyle anymore you know i just it needs to be brought up more 

Recording: (7592/ 9621)

yeah my favorite character on that show had always been chacoah and i do not like how i do not like how his character has been portrayed in in the recent couple of seasons um i like the fact that he was someone who had been a star fleet officer but because of a matter of principle uh left star trek joined the lockhe but was still uh fundamentally an honorable person um and had to deal with being welcome back into the fold of star trek by being uh first officer on the ship but still had to bow it his his new life uh i saw so much potential for uh interesting stuff with it but i feel that he is become just uh just another character to deliver lines for most of the episodes they have seen from the this this past season i stopped 

Recording: (7602/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (7603/ 9621)

Recording: (7620/ 9621) 
yeah it is um 

Recording: (7621/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (7622/ 9621) 
um i used to be a turner pilot and a flight instructor and i used to go to work at like eight oclock in the morning and get home for my first meal with johnny carson and i did this six days a week and to get my my one day off i would get up at like at seven oclock and get my car and drive to the mall and park and sleep in my car 

Recording: (7623/ 9621) 
and there was one where they were going along and there is a little uh spanish you looking dog about so long and about that high kind of falling on long after i am am glad that i finally see somebody i can be sorry for to forthall worse off than i am 

Recording: (7624/ 9621) 
oh really 

Recording: (7625/ 9621) 
i really think civil rights have gone too far because for every rule that says you cannot do this to the other person there is another rule over says that that is okay to the person does it to you i mean there my mother used to say for every law always written there is another law written over here that will actually i will callify that one and i and actually i i have growing older i found it in it is worse than today is world as i said as the silver rights moving and you have a right to this and you have a right to that it is terrible murderers get away with murder now by that plea bargain that plea bargain i think is the most thing that ever was passed i do not think there should be any plea bargains and then the people who from the government there are people who get murdered you know instead of electric chair electric chair i still believe in it because they have someone in his pool and i do not believe that they should have ten years of uh what do they call that legal process where they can putting appeals you think you that is it i do not think they should have that either one appeal or two should be the limit it they are still found guilty sorry and if an innocent person has not been able to prove he is innocent that is just one of those freaky things that happens because sometimes innocent people do pay the penalty for someone else that is guilty that is corrupt enough that he is minded he does how to get away with it and gets somebody else to take his blame but i do not think there is that many innocent people that ever went to the electric chair that they should actually have qualified that because what right does that person have to live tv just about two or three days ago and here is this guy down the south end and as he is walked out and left behind him under putting him to cruise there well i did turn exactly well i said i was going to do it i was just says russia is drawing the last month he kills her now he is going to go and probably made me a plea bargain and he will get off with it because maybe he was abused as a child and they had so i am just the way he is thinking what happened to this woman because of it i am sorry let him pay the penalty and had more people paid the penalty there would be more people thinking twice three or four times before they did the same thing and that would help i think to stop some of that 

Recording: (7626/ 9621) 
that is exactly what it  

Recording: (7627/ 9621) 
well i do not know that that is a cause it it they they as a group uh in this was kind of a happen stand that it this occurred as a result of a very major world war uh so in in terms of them causing it it was it was a happenst slanted and part of this mass communication they were talking about uh began with them and yes they are a major influence because we were talking about numbers and you are talking about uh a a greater in or communication i would like to go back one step where we are talking about when i made mentioned the three doors down you do not even know who that individual is and i want to stick with that uh i think that is profound as an individual communication we are near zero in terms of global mass communication to everybody with interpersonal community that is the key my opinion personal versus international communications and and it is zero over here and we are almost a hundred percent over here but when we are in this other personal or global or massive whatever term is the most appropriate uh john douglas speech here he has an the famous idea of who jane douglas is over here on the personal it used to be that yeah you knew who this person runs over here that is jane dog that lives in that third house and she married henry jackson do not you remember old henry well hendry was a guy live way over there and the other side of town mass communications as it is today they have not the meanest idea where jane came from or where jacks or where old is whoever he was not living over there i said so i think i that i might i think you need to distinctive between the personal international relationship so maybe i die grass too far there or who is next door neighbor is 

Recording: (7628/ 9621) 
well i see i am going to add the phone way back and show my age again as most people would say uh i i would really like to see this that happen but i also know that it it will never happen within the next three or four generations but i i am of a guy who still believe that the lady has a place in her home and i do not believe that we need uh man and wife out working and making incomes as everyone in the united states today feels they must uh he is will head upon it rather lightly a while ago and was talking about need versus uh luxuries i want i want i want well i my judgement is that we are spending today probably eighty percent of uh the income on things that they want and only twenty percent on what they need and that is all they need to spend on that need so therefore the this pardon 

Recording: (7629/ 9621) 
yeah i am i am opposed to parental consent um but i do not have kids so that that opinion does not mean as much as you are might from someone who did 

Recording: (7630/ 9621) 
oh really i had not heard that uh some of the ones clinton is back down i think theyyou know for the health insurance and reform of the all that health insurance they are uh you know he backed down but it was not going to happen so he could keep you know the fear going for months and months or years and still nothing was going to happen it was the wrong time or we tried to move on to something else uh and it is regretable it has in comeback like you said it is like well i made the one attention did not they anyway or something so that dropped and it comforts somebody else to pick it up well clinton is in the main back it is like can not even bring it back 

Recording: (7631/ 9621) 
i do not think so 

Recording: (7632/ 9621) 
yeah just having fun 

Recording: (7633/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (7634/ 9621) 
i do not think it ever really occurred to me 

Recording: (7635/ 9621) 
in uh first grade his teacher knew that he needed that but the principal would not allow her to do it uh that is one reason we put him in different school for second grade uh 

Recording: (7636/ 9621)

um we have not was you know it is one of the people on our committee teaches in the math apartment here 

Recording: (7639/ 9621) 
you know when she is in her middle years and camera when she is you know but you know i finally decided why people go so crazy with this name thing is the one thing in life we get to do where there is no restrictions no laws nobody gives you any limitations or parameters they just say go for it and people just go nuts with it 

Recording: (7640/ 9621)

Recording: (7643/ 9621) 
and i like looking at the stories from a different perspective with the kid as i was always like 

Recording: (7644/ 9621) 
right because their parents are rich 

Recording: (7645/ 9621)

Recording: (7653/ 9621) 
if you just said take or get i just i say well i am just going to because when you getting done the work out in the work world there is going to be two things they care about about your writing is it usedable and is it persuadedive because usually when you are writing something in the work place it is either to explain something or it is to persuade somebody to do something so if it is not those two things it is not it is not writing that is going to make it in the world it is i mean 

Recording: (7654/ 9621) 
you know society again is taking away everything from you

Recording: (7700/ 9621) 
until see what else happens i mean from what i know this story was kind of happy and uh many ways the children is story but what has to happen within the larger story between now and and you know the end of the end of theair takes over and all the jet air kills by this cute little eight year old kid 

Recording: (7701/ 9621) 
my oldest son was in vietnam 

Recording: (7702/ 9621)

Recording: (7703/ 9621) 
yeah we are going up there to can not really remember you know it is been twenty years ago  and i just you know i do not have a real recollection 

Recording: (7704/ 9621) 
i love it when people come from out of town because then i get to try new places and i am way behind i need more company  

Recording: (7705/ 9621) 
to get bags to apples chicken sandwiches and apple juice but but then here come the uh cooper is wife and his daughter and like his son and i am thinking they are putting uh all these his family up in the so tell them it might be for a game i mean i do not know i just thought i was very strange that he would have his whole family staying there with him when all and another is boys get to bring anybody you know i mean 

Recording: (7706/ 9621) 
you know before they tell you this was last summer and it was on a vacation at myrtle beach they are telling you about the surf board that they got and how great they served when that really should come down in the body of the paper you know most people just they assume the reader knows i always say to my kids pretend like you are writing for an alien 

Recording: (7707/ 9621) 
uh well my son he worked on the coleman campaign so of course uh you know i had to get out and you know help him put the signs out and all that kind of stuff and i got theper sticker god some people in my family some bumper sticker some neighbors 

Recording: (7708/ 9621) 
and you know i would show up at their house if i thought something was going on you know it would do not matter to me i am just i said i was grew up here in columbusah and i am just dumb hillbilly you know like uh i if they were having a party at somebody is house their parents they knew i would show up there and ask them what the hell is going on 

Recording: (7709/ 9621) 
yeah i mean a lot of people really that i knew anyway did not know about extra see until they saw that movie and then it was the whole talk of high school whatever 

Recording: (7710/ 9621) 
i am not agreeing with  my grandma is saying she seems to think okay maybe but if you put a discount store in there i would love it  that is when she said i was like okay  

Recording: (7711/ 9621) 
oh yeah i would say so 

Recording: (7712/ 9621) 
yeah there was a lot of plows of things uh from it as far as discipline as far as uh uh growing up past and everything you know sometimes when i see you know or like my daughter or like other other people that age you know and everything are not you know they tend to act grown up you know where i felt like i was forced to grow up you know 

Recording: (7713/ 9621) 
yeah now 

Recording: (7714/ 9621) 
keep them on the nineties and then all of a sudden about ninety is it came around to heat and then our our deficit is going the other way we are we are going way our way out of the back on this thing as because we have been spending more consumers doing the same thing they have a learn that mom and dad remember mom and i do not own got little pieces of tina is any of the things you know i am at the whole house full for national cars we do not talk about buying cars nowadays we talk about leasing cars and pretty sure am not going to be buying houses we will be owninging houses from the finance companies we will not be owning the land the finance going to own them you do not own it you lease it and that is our quality of life and when we go to third world countries we say i do not know how they can stay living here and yet you know what they probably have better quality of understanding one than than we do because i feel like the more you get closer to one another the further they become apart 

Recording: (7715/ 9621) 
and then i have a daughter in tulsa oklahoma and i have a daughter in russian virginia so they did they are all married well three are married yeah 

Recording: (7716/ 9621) 
and um it kind of worked out because her husband was losing his job anyhow just kind of one of those okay let us do it 

Recording: (7717/ 9621) 
she is got like a third grade education she can like get herself 

Recording: (7718/ 9621) 
yeah i have not i i really have not even have not even given it that much thought yet 

Recording: (7719/ 9621) 
i have been did not say loud enough that you have the right to why we have done the phone the right you know i have never called like i make the phone call and if they can convince them and the poor policeman can not i think really what they ought to start doing is taping everything they said and taping it so it is so clear that there is no way that they can deny it and then yet they have got that thing a lot it is illegal civil to say it is illegal so they will write you can not tape on them say anything you can we signed a paper for you then get them to get them to sign when they go in there you fully understand now what we are going to do and if boy if they say that and they really make it so and actually two or three times on tape that they understand is before they sign this even well then how can they say that they they they have got to come up with new rules and they have got to make the penalty stick 

Recording: (7720/ 9621) 
uh which we we encouraged that 

Recording: (7721/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7722/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7723/ 9621) 
umhum

starting over means putting an operating system on 

Recording: (7727/ 9621) 
you are really smart no you are not dumb but they sit in class and they see their friends just catch on to things and that they can not do and so then they say well my parents are just saying that because they love me i am really stupid you know and you have to actually show them when they get to be this age that look you have a hundred and seventeen iq 

Recording: (7728/ 9621)

Recording: (7732/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (7733/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7734/ 9621) 
so they they could not go in that direction they would have to just bring in new people which then i think it probably would not be a good idea 

Recording: (7735/ 9621) 
correct 

Recording: (7736/ 9621)

Recording: (7754/ 9621) 
some  i do i it is i mean it is a very personal thing and in fact that is what they saw most of my patients are head drama so they can come up with some pretty wild stories but those vision are usually pretty clear and 

Recording: (7755/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7756/ 9621) 
no it would probably be something with his foreign policy or domestic policy that would change my mind 

Recording: (7757/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7758/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (7759/ 9621)

Recording: (7760/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7761/ 9621)

Recording: (7762/ 9621) 
yeah she she had to talk and my sister and i attend it and i do not like the problem i think with universal health care would be everyone do not you think like everyone with a little scratch would go in you know as opposed to like the very and i think i could drive costs up so there has to be a way to balance i am not sure how you would go about doing that because you do not want to put a limit and say okay you can only go three times a year 

Recording: (7763/ 9621)

i do not know i think i really do not know i think in today is world what they call the nineties that it is just like everything is changed like when i grew up we kids it grew up when we grew up and everything else we had standards and whenever certain things we did or did not do and then it came along that when our kids grew up then there was so many things that change and some of they one thing i can stand down this has no need to do a politics but it is an example in in school they changed the way they were doing their mathematics i could not even help my kids with their mathematics sometimes and i took geomgein algeable you would think you know i am just doing straight a these and algebra when i got to jump straight i thought why am i taking this the way it was not so good but still the way they were teaching it now and they are reteaching it entirely different now and i think linda talked to how they were doing them with matthe or she could not even help him um see you know in the same way of politics it people i guess change over the years they are outlook on life changes or they are whatever changes and i think it is to me it is getting worse but then my mother is saying the same thing about our generation so i think it is just the sign of the times i do not know what it is

for example one of the issues that they were in the forefront on was uh justice for um the people in central and latin america yeah  

Recording: (7784/ 9621) 
well uh they pretty much put by the test scores they do not fit you down like in private schools they do this they fit you down one to one just like we are and they spend probably you know maybe twenty thirty minutes a day actually getting another student what the student still needs for the conclusion of that grade and once they figure that you are able to go there then up you go right up the ladder

Recording: (7801/ 9621) 
all i remember is them talking about condom is i do not think they talked about anything besides that but uh then again i could be in the wrong uh but yes that i mean it is the stance but i think in the schools i mean that is sort of like the the hard line of the catholic church but in the more progressive schools they are a little bit more realistic i mean this was not i mean it was the catholic school but we did not have nun or anything there i mean uh you know i think they were sort of more concerned with you know actually it might have been later than the first um sex education we had that young i mean it might have been more like a couple like eighth grade that they would talked about us i doubt that they would have done that that early now that i think about it but i know that there was at one point you know some sort of 

Recording: (7802/ 9621)

yeah i um i mean i know so many people who you know when they get pregnant get so are so conscientious about about what they eat and and i mean they will not take any his to means in hay fever is and they know so many things that they will not do and they are so conscientious about it it is hard for me i mean i i just do not know anybody who smoked when they were pregnant or anything like that on the other hand i think i think it is a choice and um i mean you you want to wanna try to help them you want to make them aware of health issues but i mean a lot of women are not getting prenatal care either and and that is part of it and you can not you you can not arrest them for that you just got to get them to the doctor  

Recording: (7851/ 9621) 
and so you keep thinking well you know they need more but i was hoping they could use that land for something else i do not know there is you know there is so many not building but you know something maybe especially in dublin but it i it is probably will be good for kind of

Recording: (7868/ 9621) 
umhumi just had a a healthy big orous conversation last night with a town ship plus t jersey town ship which is just over in uh licking county and uh this gentleman is eighty three or four years of age and he is been to town ship trustee various times throughout his life and he is is very very concerned because of the people and hit boy actually back up he is a farmer has been a farmer all of his life he owns about a hundred and fifty acres in station to approximately a thousand which his son is mainly operating they he said he goes out and works too uh i will put out at eight at this age uh but he is concerned because they have just recently passed an orderance within the county which allows developments to come in and already they are ready to take over a couple of farms that are fairly close to him but but it affects the whole town ship and one of the things that they have left out has he put it one of the orders that he is pushed and pushed and pushed he wanted a specific part of that order that organized to say every so many people that move into this area you must provide for a school and it said i have consequently and then he said they did not do it he said i push a push and he said i do not know all the influence was on on the side to get more houses get more houses because it was going to produce more taxes but they kept saying well what do you want these taxes for if you are not going to provide for schools so he was very concerned about that so he was again in my opinion a very very honest uh politician but he was also being shoved away from what he felt was an honest approach 

Recording: (7869/ 9621) 
oh clowncona is not they anyway clowncona and you could get like a bag of uh to do the rolls and pay only five cents so that is gone and uh that was a kid thing um my grandfather used to own enemy market

Recording: (7885/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (7886/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7887/ 9621) 
like it is everything pretty i mean like basic stuff that you it would be like you know like oh herald or something like that you know or i or a bunch of different places you know like electronics uh appliances uh uh 

Recording: (7888/ 9621) 
i have done it for the last uh oh five years 

Recording: (7889/ 9621) 
yeah that could really bite you in the back though why did not all that money i would be well i would be quite consent with one million dollars but ten million dollars is kind of like overkill i mean do you think anybody inwell maybe a couple of people yeah 

Recording: (7890/ 9621) 
they like gladgete pitch you know and be happy for the indians i am like i am happy for them that is fine but 

Recording: (7891/ 9621) 
but having having done it before you know and uh knowing where i went wrong you know uh that would not happen again uh that would not happen again uh that would not happen while but but again that was back in the uh actually it was in the nineties early nineties but you know i was been doing it when we were we were uh the recreation type of thing you know notice they uh daily you know somebody come knocking on the door oh yeah okay well we uh boy uh uh some kind of place for uh you know you see a lot of uh different down out type people and everything and uh really nobody really trying to help them or something you know and uh uh i would like to think that maybe even this thing you know could be like a saints worry for them to come in and get some piece of money or something you know umhum 

Recording: (7892/ 9621) 
yeah uh that is awareness again i mean you know put two and two together you get some young teachers right out of college and then you put them with all these high school girls and these girls are looking like twenty and twenty two i mean you can not even you can not control the attraction there but you can be aware of it and you can you can uh put the put slacks on girls and not leave it up to them to choose the height of their skirts and you know and they have got stairs up and down and you know they get in their lockers and they bend over it you know and that is that is just too much i mean i think that is the first thing that has to be done take away that you know they should not even be that should not even be a thought you know and it is distracted enough for the the guys their own age but then you put these young teachers in there maybe they are single guys that were just had uh had a hard time in high in college and then they get around all these girls and like oh my gosh well you know you got to look at that you got to be more aware 

Recording: (7893/ 9621) 
sad stories uh let us see 

Recording: (7894/ 9621) 
yeah  

Recording: (7895/ 9621)

Recording: (7896/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7897/ 9621) 
she does not so much mind anymore i mean since i have turned eighteen i mean ever since then it is been a problem or anything i mean she is sort of let me have my own opinion 

Recording: (7898/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (7899/ 9621) 
right uh personally i think it is a good idea i mean i i mean to me you know it seems only a logical that you would only have the amount of children that you can support you know in that but i come from a completely different you know background and everything else and education than a lot um you know than most of probably the people that this would um concern but i do think i i do not know i mean with the the birth control that is available and you know all the options up there are sometimes i find it hard to be sympathetic for you know these people who just have so many children that they can not feed they just can not take care of i mean it is not like it was way back when when there was nothing in you were just stuck this way i mean a woman can you know protect herself if you know the the men is not willing to do it or whatever so and and and adoption and all the other things 

Recording: (7900/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (7901/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (7902/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7903/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (7904/ 9621) 
control problems of course there is always the way you sound like it yeah well it could be hot water they send out heating hot water to all the different buildings from the power plant but about now they drain that it is drained for the summer to give us an opportunity to work on leaks and stuff so they might have drained it and that is why i quit  put plastic huh yeahoh i do not know it seems like it is a tough call because it is very unusual situation here to high state where they have a union and they have so many different skills in a union you think of unions you think of auto workers you think of pipe fitterers you think of you do not think of such a wide variety of people and that is very hard to negotiate for anybody you know when you are talking raises and lots of money like this what is what they were going for and the majority of the people in the skilled trade are not real big participating in the union you know we just ride along and from what i have seen over the twenty years i have been here is it seemed that a lot of the union what they did was was keep the trouble maker employees around longer you know and so we have really never had a lot of use for the union but recently we just figured out that you know if they decide to strike we have no choice too and you can not work because they will take all the money you make crossing that line so you can out work anybody that came back to work will lose all the money that they made do not take them to court and then yeah it is against yeah it is against the union contract so you have this 

Recording: (7905/ 9621) 
um um they like me but then they do not like me 

Recording: (7906/ 9621) 
it is a good place they even stop playing the gett of music the other juke box and it was horrible they played the same three songs of like poorly offensive lyrics and no melody whatsoever

i know i know it works though but 

Recording: (7908/ 9621)

Recording: (7909/ 9621) 
i wish i would these guys going to military school and so forth you know they have had problems before somewhere along the way whether it is academics or social are you ready to take on this additional responsibility no but we do not promote it again you are right we guess uh because remember though we have academics for the university oh you are going to be a sport athlete over then you have got come here have got we have got different stand at here and i am sure they do they have different standards for uh student athlete as opposed to what your standards were coming into college i am presume you were not an athlete  

Recording: (7910/ 9621)

Recording: (7911/ 9621)

Recording: (8062/ 9621) 
um i i see it as a problem and if if i if i were african american i would i would not like to see it simply because uh you know it it is a a child not being brought up in his you know in his tradition but on the other hand i hate to i hate to see a child left in foster care or in an air conditioning when he could have a home and um i think uh parents who are willing to adjust uh a black child or a mixed raised child or an asian child or any are are going to be sensitive to to cultural things because we are just you know it is just the the way things are slanted these days i mean diversity is an issue and people who are willing to venture out into uh mixed race adoption with oh reddy beat way

Recording: (8071/ 9621)

Recording: (8072/ 9621)

Recording: (8084/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8085/ 9621) 
yeah yeah so uh i would be i am opposed to that i well yeah i i guess you would have to say that i would i would be opposed to arresting mothers for anything um in in in that relation that it is just that the effort should focus on on getting them to stop but not forcing them to stop whatever it is they are doing 

Recording: (8086/ 9621) 
all right go 

Recording: (8087/ 9621) 
okay so how you are going to help them when they are all over 

Recording: (8088/ 9621) 
it is it is not it is not intentional it is just the way he is so he was able to circumvent anything that the psychology was trying until he had finally admitted that yeah he had a problem and then things went much more smoothly and they they are still not really convinced of the diagnosis because there is multiple problems and they have not ruled down there of some of the other things in he he just knew how to get around to anything 

Recording: (8089/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8090/ 9621) 
but it was not because it clocked way our in that time he was born right on the back 

Recording: (8091/ 9621) 
you know we we uh i generally try to keep our child to the child uh you know there is a time to grow there is a time to be a child and then uh we divorced from she was eight years old so i would get up every many more and i watch cartoons with her and stuff like that you know and try not to let her watch some of the ones that i did not like you know so and then the movies movies and stuff uh we let her see some sheed a book movies and everything but the the weirdest movie she seen uh was et i remember that and i mean 

Recording: (8092/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8093/ 9621) 
okay well that is a good job i mean because you get flex time yeah it was 

Recording: (8094/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (8095/ 9621) 
almost all the parents did and 

Recording: (8096/ 9621) 
that is the grocery we use yeah 

Recording: (8097/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (8098/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (8099/ 9621) 
so i mean that is what i am saying that i i think it is even the american disability that talks about certain things about employers uh and and with my lawsuit you know with the uh the shell and you know with all the public trials of high profile trials i think it is education for everyone to know that the legal system sucks and does not work um is not fair it is a rich man is person or a rich person is system judges are bought and paid for they are elected uh there is a lot of crap there and i learned all this not from just my experience but from people that i know that our attorneys that there are judges down there that take bribe is and that is that is not right so you can not when you are dealing with that system justice comes at a price and you get as much justice as you can afford and during my lawsuit that was very evident you know laws are made to protect people they are wealthy and they commit crimes and it is not right it is not fair but that is the way it is so uh i did not want to go in the wall  did not want to go into paralegal i going looking into that and the lady kept hounding me and telling me you know uh maybe you could get in it to make a difference i am like why would i want to make a difference if it kills me you know because i know myself and i do not put up with crap you know i see a lawyer i bring him out you know and uh i was just brought up to be an honest person and uh unfortunately there is a lot of people out there that you know they sell out their ideas and their principals for forty thousand dollars a year and they use their family or their situation financially an excuse to sell those uh deals out um i am not that kind of person i do not want to ever be um so if that means that i stay monetary poor for the rest of my life then so be it you know i got a conscience and uh and people that are honest and have conscious or dangerous out there but that is yeah that is basically where i have been you know um i have lived here my whole life like i said i went to college and played baseball uh due to injuries you know knees and shoulder i just i was very i was procalibber you know uh i played baseball with uh with paul oneil and kent murder which are a couple of guys that you know did get signed professionally or playing right now um so at least they can say i played against them and uh at least i have camped off then so it was a while ago but that was one he was young and very good and i was i was three or four years older and still took him deep to centerfield so i will never forget that but uh iron it  so it is uhwell uh well that and you know i i do not refer to it as an accident anymore you know they are uh my whole life had changed uh in every fac am at home you know physically emotionally and spiritual um used to be catholic i do not follow that away any more and um you know i follow them more uh uh natural way of our own government than nothing uh new age i do not want say exactly what you know just that the people this way in long time ago before anybody came over here with their bible and crap uh ram and jesus down people is third of the people that is laying down to way of wood ship and god and that is the way i wanna put so away if all um so a lot of people say that the native american or say that indian or whatever you know i do not care what they want to put on it but it is it is it is a natural way of falling god is the way i put it you know uh worth a opinion that uh respecting the spirit to move through all things all living things and uh so i went through all that and all those changes and i are still you know coping with them and trying to find ways to cope with them to 

Recording: (8100/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (8101/ 9621) 
she said to me that can not be wrong because the computer said that was award i said that is a word come with me i will show you what a best of u was 

Recording: (8102/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8103/ 9621) 
i know i know well it is good to have that i think it would be good to have that lee way  but i am not sure i would trust myself because there there were definitely times when i was teaching when i would have more of an finity towards certain students and less towards others and i wanted to be fair in terms of uh not cutting down the ones that i did not like that much  yeah yeah 

Recording: (8104/ 9621) 
you do 

Recording: (8105/ 9621) 
and i i really feel like if you are going to run for president of the united states you ought to be smart 

Recording: (8106/ 9621) 
there is yeah 

Recording: (8107/ 9621) 
no that is one thing that i you know i found was really lacking here um for my side uh 

Recording: (8108/ 9621) 
umhum sure 

Recording: (8109/ 9621) 
he is really he is yeah he does not think through the application that the things are of my own is for somebody 

Recording: (8110/ 9621) 
i mean obviously being uh being a little boy i remember i mean just seeing even things like football or whatever i mean it is you would see something you thought it was neat so you would do it or whatever 

Recording: (8111/ 9621) 
hope the curb  

Recording: (8112/ 9621) 
yeah it it says 

Recording: (8113/ 9621) 
i was working out there 

Recording: (8114/ 9621) 
i wish they could 

Recording: (8115/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (8116/ 9621) 
oh yeah it is kind of like making your mouth water when you see food 

Recording: (8117/ 9621) 
on the other thing is to close i just feel we have to keep we have to grow those people have to travel so far to shop and you know and i do not think that is really fair to them 

Recording: (8118/ 9621) 
to me that was very strange 

Recording: (8119/ 9621) 
oh she is cute she really is really cute i mean i mean she is got big eyes and big fluffy cheese 

Recording: (8120/ 9621) 
it is always going to be somebody can complain about something well that is another thing where you have to take the individuality into account because not everybody likes to cook you know everybody most people know how to open a can of soup or something and boil water make some toes but you know that is about all that they want to do as far as it comes to cooking even if they do have to cook for their family not everybody not every female likes to cook you know they just do it because you know they are supposed to or whatever and i know some families where the men the the husband does all of the grocery shopping and all the cooking and the wife does you know whatever she does i mean it is individuality again so 

Recording: (8121/ 9621) 
okay so people get like fly in do do they do they little waiting things why out 

Recording: (8122/ 9621) 
yeah it is weird they i do not know this makes sense a little bit different so 

Recording: (8123/ 9621) 
that does not so much bother me it is just having it forced on me like i say just sort of gives me a different opinion of it 

Recording: (8124/ 9621) 
yeah you even got these oh stunk guns they are the ones that scare me 

Recording: (8125/ 9621) 
yeah james and james and i went together 

Recording: (8126/ 9621) 
umhum umhum 

Recording: (8127/ 9621) 
see that they are again the business out box the consumer basically you need to do less cons in buying material goods and sharing your time with one other try to understand your neighbor more and spend time getting quality time for understanding the intangibles of life the depreciates depreciate and they will depreciate and we will be nothing and your investment is gone 

Recording: (8128/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (8129/ 9621) 
well that used to be where you know all the teenage teenagers went 

Recording: (8130/ 9621) 
yeah exactly 

Recording: (8131/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8132/ 9621) 
um i mean i feel i lean toward no i do not have a problem actually i saw something on the news the other night about they were offering um crack mothers like money for a sterilization and there was a big debate about that um but again like the argument there on the human rights side was that if they are you know on cocaine or whatever they can not make the sound decision to be sterilized by at the same time like can they make the sound decision to have children 

Recording: (8133/ 9621) 
because see well i have five babies you know i really have to work when you talk about that the older you get i have to work really really hard to stay in halfway decent shape 

Recording: (8134/ 9621) 
i love it  

Recording: (8135/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8136/ 9621) 
no i mean the money you know money is great you know fine it is the biggest raise they have ever given anybody here at the university and actually the deal that they offered the sunday before they went on on strike was a better deal than what they have really settled for now as far as because the signing bonus was more and the big stipulation was the fact that these people did not want to be separated from the hospital they do not think it is fair you know that you start down at the hospital as a janitor or whatever and you make this amount and if you came to main campus you would make seventy five cents more an hour automatic and then they did the raise and they wanted eighty cents at the hospital and a dollar on main campus and stuff so that is kind of a sticky situation because they have always kept the university and the hospital separate budget they are definitely a separate budget and you know the hospital i can see where they are coming from everybody in the hospital business is struggling right now with the insurance problems and this and that and they are thirty five million in the hole because they bought oh u east and all this but you know it is not the union is fault that they ran out their contract you know and you know so and what we find in our area mainly is that people uh insurance wage is so low that it is hard to find anybody that has any skills to come in and do the jobs that you know and they want this place to be the top ten in the nation or whatever as far as but they are not willing to pay a lot of these people and you know they think contracting is the way but you are always going to have to have people here to because contractors just do not drop what they are doing in show up today and a lot of times we have a job finished before they have written up the work order 

Recording: (8137/ 9621) 
well when you have formulas to make bums and you know 

Recording: (8138/ 9621) 
it did not it is at the same building actually it is it is set it is used for different things 

Recording: (8139/ 9621) 
yeah i was over in nineteen i was eighteen when i went in but 

Recording: (8140/ 9621) 
exactly but i do there there is the other side um that uh with with native americans too it is you know you know our children are being taken away from it well not exactly you are giving up your children and and then something has to be done but but there is also there is also that i i mean i think it is probably a legitimate fear that children children children of that group are going to you know going to be a marginized out of out of their heritage but i do not know i you know their kids without parents  

Recording: (8141/ 9621) 
i mean they are agave in congress they are a gavees in the military you know just as long as people do not know they they do not feel threatened see and and i have i i do not understand that minds that i really do not i do not really know why a man feels threatened by having a game near them uh i have a couple of game friends and in one of my friends always says um you know does every man like every woman he sees is he attracted every woman and you know wanna go to bed with every woman you know what makes a man think that just because i am gay i might be interested in him you know that is the height of oregon um years but but men feel threatened by that just as i guess women feel threatened by lesbians i do not know but it is not a mind that i have so it is hard for me to understand 

Recording: (8142/ 9621) 
five six seven eight nine ten just to get a volume level 

Recording: (8143/ 9621) 
okay i might want to try to jazz it to the movie again if you get it goes on the country you know 

Recording: (8144/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (8145/ 9621) 
he would absolutely have to build my trust for a long time 

Recording: (8146/ 9621) 
it is probably the best thing for me 

Recording: (8147/ 9621) 
but they just did not hang out with the entire crowd 

Recording: (8148/ 9621) 
right and you can get them walking down the street 

Recording: (8149/ 9621) 
which every kid in the world plays with 

Recording: (8150/ 9621) 
so but you know uh in that you know a lot of times you think about you know uh made you even know you sit there so i wanted a phone call they you know all you do is call me but it is not the same thing as being here in the east well i have never won time and she was having her stomach age she was like uh twelve or thirteen years old you know and as of what is the matter and she goes uh my stomach hurts i said uh or i got on your period or what you know and she goes dad 

Recording: (8151/ 9621)

Recording: (8155/ 9621) 
i have thought about that it is sad i am i mean that is why i have not went to college or anything because there is nothing in my mind has said on that i want to do in life i just want to be rich  

Recording: (8156/ 9621) 
everyone is like you have got the lucky i am like well it is going to catch up just wait  

Recording: (8157/ 9621) 
well it is something that i i wanted to get into some kind of counseling with people that have been through traumatic experiences but i need to be at a point where you know i am in my recovery where i know i will not be second back down into their way of thinking um so it is it is a step by step process i i try to go into counseling for chemical adductions you know for alcohol and drugs but the bulsheet of excuses i up here and from these addicts there is just too much to take and even even the bulshed excuses from former addict 

Recording: (8158/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8159/ 9621) 
but my son he just he is so uh i mean i do not know if you have ever met anybody that is totally into politics 

Recording: (8160/ 9621) 
then you get the shooting out and honestlyly live in the next day there is another one it is just kind of like that syndrome you know well at least i can be popular for fifteen minutes or whatever um i mean i am not saying not to cover it but ridiculous  

Recording: (8161/ 9621) 
have you have we stayed here probably 

Recording: (8162/ 9621) 
when i was a kid of never yall at me i have been to make damn sure he did not tell my dad 

Recording: (8163/ 9621)

Recording: (8165/ 9621) 
yeah and he says he knows them asked as well but he does not like to do it so he does not do it  

Recording: (8166/ 9621) 
so there was uh a waddy they call him it was like a little deep wish 

Recording: (8167/ 9621) 
right yeah 

Recording: (8168/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (8169/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8170/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8171/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (8172/ 9621) 
i think that is a cop out myself 

Recording: (8173/ 9621) 
oh it was nice actually i eat a lot more healthy and um it was cheaper i was getting money on my book idea so i actually got paid every day 

Recording: (8174/ 9621) 
you know imagine it not basically what happened to her and her mom had three kids by three different dads and they saw it if they could get her out of that environment they actually had her move in with them they were her temporary foster parents and she just turned sixteen so she was fifteen when she moved in with them she refused to change and uh i do not know what could have changed if they would have got around earlier but basically all three of them i do not want to say are bumped but they are not even though they are out of that environment they are not doing any better 

Recording: (8175/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (8176/ 9621) 
yeah you still have to be careful in yeah 

Recording: (8177/ 9621) 
umhumi am sure somewhere i am sure somewhere on the line they would work things out to try to help her over those bums it would not be a long term and they would know that it would not be long term but that is that intangible i am saying you have somebody there because she is getting up her time and not to make the high bucks but she what she is bringing about is developing a character and a person to bring about the spirit child in a person that is going to carry them all through life she is also um tiding more than tiding probably which uh i always uh kid with people said the author that said ten percent tiding new inflation he knew gave out economics ten percent and ten percent and then uh on top of that you know we are talking about about economics uh look further here uh the japanese so forth they save so much more and the on german so forth and uh boy you know they are not going to take a page of the old bible are not they we do not  

Recording: (8178/ 9621) 
yeah because it is the midwest yeah 

Recording: (8179/ 9621) 
i am getting ready to get through layoffs again where i work at 

Recording: (8180/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (8181/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (8182/ 9621) 
because that is more boring 

Recording: (8183/ 9621) 
um to move forward in my life now what happened with the chill was you know there was uh i had a friend that worked for them so they did not know that and um uh he told me that there was glass in the back room that they were supposed to install they are supposed to install those five feet higher three to five feet higher and uh if i did not get up i would not go ahead i mean there is no two ways about it but if i did not get it over and uh but if i am now spiritly so i do not refuse as an accident in most of the spiritual leaders and people i talk to uh i went through the catholic church because that was where i was raised and when i was raised and none of those people could provide me with any adequate things in terms of counseling i know they tried i know they did the best they could but uh there is a lot of things that the catholic church will not like to admit that they are wrong and they are wrong um uh they will sit there and ask me to tell them from my sense yet they will not return for the sense of all the three that are molesting children still to this day and they protect them and it is not right and i am very very uh outspoken about that so rather than bang my head on the wall to people who would not listen i just decided i do not leave the church i do not go there anymore the only time i have gone there was for mine if ised bapism and my grandparents is you know and that is the only time in front of me in there you know i went to a wedding too but it is difficult sitting in there because of the way i follow them now and uh i actually see anything for what they are and it and found all the information that showed that they had all that higher taller glass back there over a year so they were trying to use the excuse their excuse was that they could not find the hardware doing all that and uh giving all the hardware stores that we have here and the ability of over night afraid things uh if it was any kind of uh special hardware that needed to be ordered from out of state or out of the country there is no excuse you know so basically you know they came down to after it came to a legal battle which was uh i was not going to back down they were uh i was poor monet they knew that so they were using the legal system to wear me down uh the first uh at the date of filing i mean first of all it took had a statute of limitations was two years uh i had an attorney in the law for or a beginning but they were dragging their feet i felt they were dragging their feet because they were in bed with the chill you know and that they were getting paid under the table to drag their feet even though i knew the guy so i just said oh look i am dissatisfied i am gonna go fight another attorney so it will give me my file see and i went shopping around for a new attorney and it took me about seven before i do not pardon me seven attorneys before i found one that was adequate in terms of knowledge of head injury and brain injury because his father was a nurse surgeon and uh he had experience and expertise and uh bringing up the uh the differences uh in the reality of of a brain injury uh and the effects the white long effects you know so after the two years we got in uh just under two years so i mean oh that would be what happened in ninety three so just under december ninety five uh the day the last day of uh the statute running out we found so we got it found once it was found the judge uh scheduled hearing and for whatever stupid reason um the soonest they could hear the case was one year from the day that we follow so you can see when you get in bed with you know involved in the legal system in terms of filing a multim million but i am saying you know there is no priorization in the legal system there are some things that uh should be addressed soon uh should not have to wait that long but so then he came down to a one week prior to the uh hearing and they got a letter from the attorney and he said that uh an also phone call from the office saying that uh um judge granted them an additional year of discovery uhthey have been you know the judge said they have to back it up but so that put us up on uh trial for another year which would be on you know but that is exactly what they were planning on you know for rearing me down like i said knowing that i do not have the money to throw in there and say hey you know um but they know full of the we had all the evidence that we had too so uh that just put us upon it for another year finally we got into uh coming in and then they uh sent a letter saying they wanted to meet uh for ar and to see if they we could hammer out some kind of settlement a couple months before trial uh i was on a where it is a common practice but you know it was very iffy situation uh juries here uh in climates have been ultra conservative uh they feel that people for some reason or another that people that have been legitimately injured in their lives have been affected that they do not deserve money for whatever reason um and i do not think it is fair that they can sit back and be that conservative if it has not happened to them i do not think that is fair uh because it does affect your entire lot of hands otherwise i would be full time employed i would be getting fully employed and making money and i am not and that is that is not because of anything uh it is by choice is on my part but it is it is uh you know there is a lot that there is a lot there the portrays i have had to struggle with there is a lot there that um you know i feel i have been portrayed by everybody that taught me i feelfed by the the government by the legal system by the politicians by all the people they have been put in charge to protect people to protect the ideas to protect principals throw it out the window for money and they when it comes down to me being legitimately hurt um they got down to just a dollars and cents bartering for what my life was worth and it is the bitter started a hundred twenty five thousand dollars and i feel home worth more than that you know i feel you can not put a value on any human life um you know there are just subtle things that you know my sense of taste and some of them was gone for about a year and a half uh just all the drama that goes involved with it not just not just the physical drama i mean that was enough to kill anybody but because of me because of my size because of my strength uh i was not killed you know uh so the physical burden on still dealing with a lot of the physical paint uh it is gotten significantly less but uh the emotional paint was worse and is worse um having to have a you know a lack of money now means lack of socializing means lack of going and doing things uh you know do not have many a lot of relationships do not have a girl friend do not have a wife do not nothing like that i have got a dog uh going retriever

um but they always they do not let the animal sleep with you know that and with the cat and they crawl up with you it is hard to say you know something about no but you know i i do not think eventually well it it took probably a year 

Recording: (8330/ 9621) 
badly i  marketing is not my strong suit i mean most of the stuff that i get is just is is an accident i started working for us u because another uh administrator that they used who was not going to be able to do the work anymore recommended me you know that kind of thing but he was a guy  

Recording: (8331/ 9621)

Recording: (8340/ 9621) 
to melt in soft and the metal so they could work with it um yes the air would help increase the temperature but a fire cap for a long period huh it will be hotter than any kind of fire you have ever touched or been around and that far it is sacred it is a sacred fire uh so that is why it is possible but if it if i went down there with the laws of physics told me that those rocks could not sustain heat yet i see when the firekeeper breaks amount of the out of the fire pit brings them into this what logic they are red orange growing you know tell me they are not hot so that is that is one example um 

Recording: (8341/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (8342/ 9621) 
you know and they work hard you know to make it easier on the students you know they totally rest structured the place since the beginning of the year

Recording: (8344/ 9621) 
 he needs counseling  at that point

well it is well let us put it this way i can go out and make money without even making money off government agencies if i wanted to too if i wanted to be a crook i could i could be a crook and uh i could have people run me at house and let me come back to the movie in there 

Recording: (8384/ 9621) 
tv about it and everything that stuff has been going on pretty years so 

Recording: (8385/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (8386/ 9621) 
okay so um christian eye uh spent the rest of the evening calling people i i got it in my hand that i did not want anybody to call and say how your dad doing and so the best way to do with that situation was to callgloably across the board plus it was a fun psychological experiment just as as they go because how often did you get to tell people  to tell them something this morning so i uh i i know and i have talked to you all over the ones and everything oh actually no my my father killed himself this morning you are kidding so you you end up after a dozen or so people narrowing it down you have got you are kidding you are not serious no 

Recording: (8387/ 9621) 
just from doing that but when you have a dog why bother um and they will not allow dogs so she is not allowed to go over there so she is always said but but it does make a big difference i guess that is what i am saying for them 

Recording: (8388/ 9621) 
yeah that is uh the bureaucracy be too much of a struggle i think 

Recording: (8389/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (8390/ 9621) 
you know so they offer do something to med school here 

Recording: (8391/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8392/ 9621) 
it is hard to 

Recording: (8393/ 9621) 
ah 

Recording: (8394/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (8395/ 9621) 
they have heard some of them talk about it 

Recording: (8396/ 9621) 
no i do not know maybe it is a little bit more dangerous uh but i think that comes with the with the bigger city when you get more people there is obviously going to be some more problems um by that i mean that is really that is really all that i notice it is obviously a lot more build up it is gotten a lot more commercial things like city center and 

Recording: (8397/ 9621) 
that makes sense and a lot of the new ball parks are made smaller so they can hit home runs because that just drives us off the people going nuts people would rather see a tight game it was like seven to like six rather than much like a a two to one ball game 

Recording: (8398/ 9621) 
real positive about it but basically i i lived here for for my whole life and i grew up on campus and 

Recording: (8399/ 9621) 
i thought it was sporty three 

Recording: (8400/ 9621) 
yep you have got 

Recording: (8401/ 9621) 
 uhhuh 

Recording: (8402/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (8403/ 9621) 
uh and of course bill molding was they great i i mean you have you have seen his cartoons and even to 

Recording: (8404/ 9621) 
so it does not ever fall it is in the audience and  

Recording: (8405/ 9621) 
and as to what thethous you should be like  so we had a tour uh the choir took a tour our choir director uh arrangeded it to about six five or six churches in the columbus area to sing in them and not for an audience but just to sing and to see which ones we like the acoustics of and uh that was interesting we sang in uh we sang in central presbyterian church downtown which is where this my one of my orchestras play the lot and uh we sang in other different kinds of churches and said what we liked about them what we did not  maybe it had some feedback i think the new building is acoustically very good it is certainly much better than old more ship center because i do not know if you have seen a picture or anything of the church but the old wood ship center was designed by a modern architect to be a modern quote unquote type building in nineteen sixty two and it is yeah it is it is flat there is a flat roof with a clear story in the middle that has nothing in it just it is just empty space over the over the woodstock center so when you was singing in that is a choir spread out along the front if you were under the high place your voice would go all the way to the back but if you were under this flat feeling that is only about seven or it is only about nine or ten feet high it was dead it was not from the  and uh it was terrible exactly  but you know we made do with it for many years and then uh and then we had the chance to get this input into this new building and it is it is uh it is really beautiful it is a circular almost circular big uh space with a high point in the middle of the roof and uh it is it is nice  well you could still go it they will not have they will not have a lot of uh 

Recording: (8406/ 9621) 
so yeah those places were probably about thirty years old i you know fire hazard insulation just you know fire hazard everywhere 

Recording: (8407/ 9621) 
right and i think that you know i think that it is just because you know you do so because i know i had done studies and i think some of those classes and you just think about it that way and i think a lot of these people just you know they say the nurse said something you take everything for a fact and i thought that was kind of strange but i mean i think there is a lot of things that are probably positive enough about it that i would not want to do it for for a while as long as i could 

Recording: (8408/ 9621) 
well well yeah well librarianians traditionally have problems with it it is like a former  you it if somebody is out there actually doing criminal work criminal activity in causing damage you want to know about it but how do you do they have some particular rights of everybody else that i do not know how to balance it 

Recording: (8409/ 9621) 
um as far as my brother goes i cant say i really see my brother too often um he does live in town uh but usually he is either at work because he works full time then he has he is a part time student at columbus state um so i do not really see him during the day and then at night he usually goes out and does his thing and i go out and do my thing so i mean as far as what is going on with him i really do not know but i know i mean there is nothing real serious going on with him or anything like that 

Recording: (8410/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8411/ 9621) 
uh like here i have been some you know they they have been here for a while um then there was not any parties here for a little while and then uh up in new ones eng cleveland since he dayton uh aick run detroit new york pittsburgh so they do not be a 

Recording: (8412/ 9621) 
i am i am really lucky uh you know everyone is always talking about their horrible kids and my kids are phenomenal uh we have this arrangement i do everything i possibly can to make them happy 

Recording: (8413/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8414/ 9621) 
um i mean in fact of the matter is a lot of people out there i guess could be child molesters or whatever i mean it does not matter if they are straight or gay or whatever the fact of the matter is i mean they are they are out there 

Recording: (8415/ 9621) 
and as do you my husband sometimes i mean we have taken jury out to the military a few times to go to the grape side of his mother and he says you know very often boy she would really have liked to have been here and done things with him 

Recording: (8416/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8417/ 9621)

Recording: (8429/ 9621)

Recording: (8455/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (8456/ 9621) 
that is good no not really actually some some i have and then i run into people that just like anything they want to get out of their home town they do not like it they complain but normally i find that those people are not taken advantage of the you know free art shows and you know what i mean the things that are free i am like oh have you done this no i do not even know about it and you have lived here all your life and i have really lived here x number of years and 

Recording: (8457/ 9621) 
at each other is through for this that and the other and you know devisland my daughter is the one that i really get put in the middle of it you know and probably it was a blessing that they moved to san jose because they probably could have been more uh problems legal problems you know as far as uh going back and forth across putting her on the with the a stand for a stupid stuff you know so uh in the high side it was kind of a blessing that you knew there 

Recording: (8458/ 9621)

Recording: (8459/ 9621) 
i do not have money and when i start dating people i would i have extremely expensive tastes for women and i like wine and dining people i love the opera and that gets real expensive for a while it gets real expensive after a while uman accounting class  had a real big mess academically uh graduated high school of three five it was all college prep classes ap courses i have got a really high iq extremely intelligent all through high school i was just coaching on that and the like i would go in take an exam big bang go out in a little study for it i think i studied as much my senior year as i did in my freshman year for one mid term they are we are one final and uh that just did not work when i got to college but i did not know that until i was almost my freshman year with a one point seven gpa but uh about uh oh see the middle of winter quarter i realized why i was in engineering i had applied to three colleges in my senior year of high school ohio state on a whim from my dad who told me to apply there because i could get in without any trouble whatsoever naval academy in the air force academy no able academy air force academy in west point or three of the top ten hardest schools in the world to get into you get into one of those academyies when you are coming out it is an engineer that is what they all are i mean yeah there is other there is other fields but the last majority of our engineers i like math and science so i figured well engineering i do not know many other options i must be engineering so i came or medicine and i went into the honors program that was a big mistake really really big mistake i got to college and it just went down hill i had all that freedom and they had no clue how to study and it just went to hell in hand basket summer um spring quarter i switch my major in music because i am extremely musicalized it is one of the gifts that i have gotten and um that um that i discovered is very similar to acting which i love to do but i realize that just like acting you are all good ninety five percent of you are poor as dirt three percent of you are right in the middle and two percent of you are extremely wealthy and the last majority of it even like i said ninety five percent are dirt poor and i do not want to do that and uh my dad is a doctor i was raised in high society i do not want to leave high society i like it there  i like it there a lot yeah and um so i was like oh but get out of the but get out of of the music thing so i decided to go into business but um i can not get into business until i get a bunch of bunch of prerequisite courses out of the way because my gpa is on it i after this quarter i did really go this quarter after this quarter it is up to two two and i am not going to be able to get into the business school until i got a bunch of prerequis it out of the way and their frequency i can not take kind of two twelve until i am at to eleven i can not take say i asked to a hundred and to a one and so two hundred and two hundred and all that junk so i had to take this stupid class this summer because if i am going to get in when i want to um i have i have to take it this summer i hate taking classes this summer um because i would rather just i would rather just work and and not worry about the classes and then have them it was real fun all summer long with all my friends but so i can not work yeah it irs my brain a little bit but i am still searching for a job it is not that i can not find jobs this i can not find them when i want i mean the job market around nine ten dollars an hour so i can get a full forty hour week and they will not have a problem leaving you five oclock because i have a class of five thirty but that is what i am doing this summer i am still searching for a job i would have i would have done some more searching today but i have had a few problems with my say you are not computer 

Recording: (8460/ 9621) 
uh yeah it would be just one more thing 

Recording: (8461/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8462/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (8463/ 9621) 
yeah no problem 

Recording: (8464/ 9621) 
tie 

Recording: (8465/ 9621) 
i do not have a good opinion of uh columbus schools at all no not at all 

Recording: (8466/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8467/ 9621) 
oh it is horrible  because you watch it and you think i think 

Recording: (8468/ 9621) 
yeah that is what i mean they go by your age too 

Recording: (8469/ 9621) 
just because it is been three weeks now you know and not even up there so something in the dealer if they lose their benefits after two weeks in the union has to pay their full wages for the work that they miss 

Recording: (8470/ 9621) 
right umhum 

Recording: (8471/ 9621) 
it is kind of frustrating but i i it is a good it is probably good for me because i am so it is hard for me to to sit back and let other people believe whatever they want to move you know i just want to convince them but i can not do that so it is a good exercise for me i look at it that way and just letting them go ahead 

Recording: (8472/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (8473/ 9621) 
bly clothes you be correctly i just noticed that it continued to decline all through high school and i was like you know you should get out before you actually fail the class  and um it was it was just unpleasure i think i was stupid i think that is one of the amounts too not that i was not able to pick up the data i was just uh you know to unwise in in whether or not it was worthwhile and i believe it it is uh probably worthwhile now and yet now i am not taking classes so 

Recording: (8474/ 9621) 
to deal with 

Recording: (8475/ 9621) 
i mean the way i grew up is probably like back in the day like the catholics against uh columbus public you know like the red cheese against the poories that is how i kind of see but when i went to northland people are being north north like a red school but the way i see it is no not really i mean we do live in a big you know house area you know the houses are like huge but uh um i mean columbus publicates they got some work done too like the other night i was watching tv in uh in elementary school overdosed the kid on like some uh i think it was a drug to calm him down so he is not so hyper and they like overdosed him like twice in a day and then when he goes home as a mom even overdue his name because he they are overdue his name 

Recording: (8476/ 9621) 
and we month they are what they watch television wise we do a lot of library things get them to the library a couple of days a week trying to keep them interested in books and 

Recording: (8477/ 9621) 
sure 

Recording: (8478/ 9621) 
yeah oh yeah the five year old just after the whole time the minute she walks in the door you know 

Recording: (8479/ 9621) 
yeah the the brady bill did not really do it for america like they thought i mean you wait five days big deal go out on twenty fifth avenue and pick one up in five minutes you know  i have seen all kinds of people carry guns that should not 

Recording: (8480/ 9621) 
but eventually in a way i just i i just because i would get stressed out and start crying and crazy you know 

Recording: (8481/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (8482/ 9621) 
um and it was nice uh just seeing that and you could tell they were still in love and everything and you know and one of them had four children one had like six you know i mean it was amazing because i thought why that they are not still married getting right out of high school i just was not interested in that when i was in high school at all you know i was ready to go out into the world and these girls that get married so young and they just have no clue about life 

Recording: (8483/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (8484/ 9621) 
i deliver the columbus this batch in the morning too so 

Recording: (8485/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8486/ 9621) 
he sure was 

Recording: (8487/ 9621) 
very often i mean maybe like there is like one or two that come during the year 

Recording: (8488/ 9621) 
oh yeah yes 

Recording: (8489/ 9621) 
we were talking about this at work one day and they said you know i am surprised you think that way because i can it can be a little left to center on most of these sometimes it is far left but and i said now this is not i she said it seems like that would be a conservative view my opinion the conservative view is that they do not want to go back to cuba down to the communists and uh but people i have talked to even extreme conservative and liberals they all pretty much feel the same way that ones are i have heard i have heard anybody 

Recording: (8490/ 9621) 
and my young star when i was traveling back that they said i talked to them and they said well we are coming to ohio in a couple of weeks and i said oh okay you did not come and see us um well now we were not we were in plan now and i said well why well we are not driving uh doggy is running at the car well all that meant with my sister was running the car but he was driving the car but i said well then how are you going to get to these other places and normally i would not do that i would just let it go well uh uh a dogy is running the car and they said well are are not you driving it well well yeah but and i said fine i do not want to even think about so it is kind of like 

Recording: (8491/ 9621) 
well i believe that is the way it was originally said uh beautiful so 

Recording: (8492/ 9621) 
uh well i am not to mayor or anything so i am not going to be getting from this  

Recording: (8493/ 9621) 
like the most far 

Recording: (8494/ 9621) 
yeah  

Recording: (8495/ 9621) 
he is like this robot 

Recording: (8496/ 9621) 
yeah  i am at the end of it all 

Recording: (8497/ 9621) 
but then uh it is like that some evil person back there in the screening room put some of this junk in there right in the middle and then you go you can not stop and not watch that you know you can not and if i was in church i would catch some of it out it is not that important 

Recording: (8498/ 9621) 
oh probably my family my kids are here have a grandchild now so yeah i would like to stay close to all them 

Recording: (8499/ 9621) 
why do not you do it for a year i know do it for a year just go down for the day and then come back to up around from the night and live i would like to do that um 

Recording: (8500/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8501/ 9621) 
very slow very methodical we take them to dog my husband is taken them many times for when they had to have cadillac operations you know so he is involved with the girls too 

Recording: (8502/ 9621) 
yeah i do not know that is so controversial i mean i mean to the point i mean they shell me out of put kind of money in us and public schools and it is like well are you promoting sex down it or should do i 

Recording: (8503/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (8504/ 9621) 
like i do not flash mine are so like if you look at like different ethicals there is and stuff like you like there is a down kind of this what i have found there is a downarkee of things that are uh like the alien animal rights for instance like i can not if you calling into my house and rob me and then run outside i not going to i do not like to kill you for stealing my property like there is a high archie there uh for stealing another life that is why people say oh you can do it so but i really feel like there is nothing like if i if it is in the animal the definition is it is not able to be taken not even by yourself that is why you can not commit suicide and since it is the highest thing because without it you can not even do the other it so it naturally has to be higher ordered than the others because without that you can not do the you can not be ethical in any other way so that has to be the highest thing and if it is been able because i did not give it to you i can not take it back you never forefitted that you never gave me that right so that is why i feel like i could never want that in it to kill another person 

Recording: (8505/ 9621) 
but it kind of helps actually because uh you have other people in there who are not owners and they do not know how to lick their partying they do not have to study or anything so 

Recording: (8506/ 9621) 
oh see 

Recording: (8507/ 9621)

Recording: (8513/ 9621) 
um you know i mean i do not think they should make people brave they do not want to before class or anything you know like that but as far as morals and the right thing to do in life and what is out there and you know most kids know what the wrong thing is but 

Recording: (8514/ 9621) 
short uh s a for for a test and um but the way that i would grade those would be pretty scientific i think you know it would come up with a rubber and i would say you you need to have you need to mention certain things and i will give certain points for your mentioned that certain thing  yeah i have i have never been a i have never been a teacher where who is had to assign their grade creative writing and im not sure i would know how to do that yeah

Recording: (8528/ 9621) 
oh really

just because you are i mean i was not really a an athletic i did to play uh sports for the reason in high school but i would answer it was not any good you know it was it was like other guys but whether i did or whether i did it you know i oh i do not nobody picked on the only i mean one time i got into it what with one of the uh centers in football you know the new old guy and then uh you know i still about the same size but 

Recording: (8535/ 9621) 
yeah i am not married i am single 

Recording: (8536/ 9621)

Recording: (8538/ 9621) 
but with kids and they are just so much more active at a early age 

Recording: (8539/ 9621) 
umhum do you know um a group called uh midnight oil yeah  they are pretty good i like them yeah 

Recording: (8540/ 9621) 
um sector and i think that is a good sign but i think there is a huge there is millions of children that do not have any health care and that is not right there is like there is a lot of like between the low in the upper there is a huge disparity but at least it is a step in the right direction we have a a nice south middle middle income middle income middle income middle income base i think because a lot of countries only have like i i visit of mexico and seems like they only had the distinctive between the opera and lower i mean their middle class is very small and that i have been that economy is coming along too and i mean it it will be it developing itself which is which is nice i took a tour of a a plant down there because my my old my old man had business down there so i had to see it and and like it seems like it was coming along and they treat their workers better granted those workers make they close them like to seven bucks a day but they get they get bussed to work because none of them have cars and then on top of that they all get a meal because they they like a hot meal like they have a cafeteria there because i was talking to the the one of the managers and he said if we do not do that then they will not be thinking about our quality and they will be thinking about getting food and they will be hungry so it hurts our quality so for them it was worth it and i 

Recording: (8541/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8542/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8543/ 9621) 
um well like i said before i think i do not know i think screening would be very difficult i mean especially because at that age you are going to have a lot of people who are you know people say things to say things and to get a reaction and to tell their friends but they said i mean you know they can play off whatever and unless they were you know 

Recording: (8544/ 9621) 
umhum i do not know that they would use the information  i i do not know 

Recording: (8545/ 9621) 
i mean no crash or anything but was rather scared  kind of shaken up by it but um no they are very very serious about does not need of drivers 

Recording: (8546/ 9621) 
well most people think it is something they rely on like well the money getting from the lottery to the people or lottery to the schools on that issue then yeah i i agree with the gambling thing you know just as long as it is like social drinking  in a sense because if you have people just go out like today i bought a one dollar a lot of ticket one two bucks off of it so i kept them on one dollar and uh got them on one dollar i do not know and got a one dollar i did not own and then then they and then they and then they and then they and then they cards one of them is called battle ship that i have won lot of money off of 

Recording: (8547/ 9621) 
sitting air about that 

Recording: (8548/ 9621) 
and work later than which will find my name or he would call me and say said okay if i were not calling late tonight would you care if i stayed here a couple more hours which i think is really nice they are a lot of men that 

Recording: (8549/ 9621) 
oh gosh hey that is really going around a lot 

Recording: (8550/ 9621) 
 you always said 

Recording: (8551/ 9621) 
they set different rules up fine give me to my men to play 

Recording: (8552/ 9621) 
but it is a little farther 

Recording: (8553/ 9621) 
yeah true yes yes oh no actually my roommate is in colorado right now and he is going he he is going to be there 

Recording: (8554/ 9621)

Recording: (8555/ 9621) 
yeah i know 

Recording: (8556/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8557/ 9621) 
um actually it is more it is almost like starting to like self business um like i said it started out with my dad and uh people would ask me what i was doing i tell him they would call him they have some things around the house that need to be done then so i go there then they tell people and 

Recording: (8558/ 9621) 
teacher a couple teachers so i take a bunch of every couple years i go to different country 

Recording: (8559/ 9621) 
that would probably change my decision a little bit 

Recording: (8560/ 9621) 
well yeah 

Recording: (8561/ 9621) 
i know 

Recording: (8562/ 9621) 
and they fly checks like if you run a check today and you deposit it at the bank well that check has to go from your bank to clearing house and that is all they do all night long 

Recording: (8563/ 9621) 
your ground it um yeah 

Recording: (8564/ 9621) 
yeah so basically i learned with him the whole habit i would do this do that 

Recording: (8565/ 9621) 
oh geographyy would not hurt 

Recording: (8566/ 9621) 
that is that is our job is to spoil them so the poor things out of like you know they have the belly hanging on the ground yep 

Recording: (8567/ 9621) 
oh yeah and you know i cook meat for my husband i really do not cook red meat because he is on the road with his job and i know he stopsbs at fast food places um but i cook him chicken and pork and i make soups lot of good soups for him with meat and it really does not allow me to cook it you know i am not going to sit home and make it roast every night 

Recording: (8568/ 9621) 
i have not heard any learning them meant to the amount looking at your real thing okay so buildgum is uh 

Recording: (8569/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8570/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8571/ 9621) 
yeah she just likes the right stories and she is real creative that way 

Recording: (8572/ 9621) 
yeah it would be good though because they could take care of the books and everything and do all that kind of thing so 

Recording: (8573/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8574/ 9621) 
no painting was needed uh well then then as a result they they went through and decided since i broke the lease to uh you know get some more money out of me and go ahead andaint it anyway and they uh stretched out the first rating and changed it to a lower rating um and even though that evidence was in front of the magic rate 

Recording: (8575/ 9621) 
oh that is unfortunate she she 

Recording: (8576/ 9621) 
oh they do in ninth grade and by tenth grade in the last they are a little more focused on the fact that they better get their act together because they are going to have to go to college and this is like the only life they are going to get you know they kind of get that realization they start getting serious the kids at middle school think everything is just a big joke you know oh i am going to play in a rock band uh you know they all think they are going to be rock stars and drumberss and and you know they all think they are going to be rock stars and drummer and and you know they could carry around about anything it has not head them yet this is my real life uh this is my one real life better not throw it away they waste time you know they lose uh 

Recording: (8577/ 9621) 
yeah and and everybody is going to say she with the people that did feel comfortable with so you know and fortunately as that guy this guy fortunately was as centered for the football team as he drew up older you know uh he realized that he was not as big as important as a uh a blue out of his knee for uh oh you you know by which because i went to school with larry hatter who is the uh basketball coach for uh ou now and uh and he had the same thing happened and he had he has a scholarship road you and both of his knee are shot and everything but uh and he was a good ballpawper probably one of the best ones that i ever seen and uh drive them like a large bird you know back in that day and everything and uh but one heck of a nice car you know never let it get to it 

Recording: (8578/ 9621) 
yeah and it was like i do not know that that states go to a taurus for killing people i think they killed someone last night 

Recording: (8579/ 9621) 
i think um the people who are ready to graduate they like to the doctors and the the dentist and all the people who went here have a really good reputation like among adults it is just that the kids want to go it it is just thought of it is a somewhat party school 

Recording: (8580/ 9621) 
but i do believe if you know when you are in love and you love somebody you will not you will not too on that 

Recording: (8581/ 9621) 
oh umhum 

Recording: (8582/ 9621) 
that i wanted them to fall charges on him and they said well no uh he is not met the criteria i said well he does not get to school sometimes to lunch time uh they said well he gets here just in time to not be counted um party or not party but 

Recording: (8583/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (8584/ 9621) 
do not realize that 

Recording: (8585/ 9621) 
yeah that is why i asked that was your question are we going to have dune we are going to have a catastrophes we are going to get this thing turned around before we have yes uh i think we will uh but i do not think we are ready to turn around yet i think we are still this mass communication that she has alluted to three or four five times i it it is coming up on a so rapid they i strongly predict that in just twenty years and possibly ten each in every one of us in the world are going to be interconne get with one another but once again it is an imperson uh interconnext year i could i will be able to contact you when you are over in paris and i will be over in in high on out to our own farm and i am probably watching the geese flimming up and down to the little lake and you are sitting over there in paris having uh uh coffee something something yeah i have done 

Recording: (8586/ 9621) 
fastest that sucker on those races 

Recording: (8587/ 9621) 
i have been here all my life um i uh right now i do not do anything uh i had a head injury in ninety three where i had with a hockey and a head and a chill hockey game

uhhuh uhhuh yeah they they were all right um other columbus holly it was from columbus i do not know if you know who she is uh  

Recording: (8590/ 9621)

Recording: (8591/ 9621) 
yeah it is not like there is a face behind like the music but not so much too you know it is not like 

Recording: (8592/ 9621) 
umhum yeah 

Recording: (8593/ 9621) 
some of them transfer from up north and the out east and indiana and just different from walk of life you know 

Recording: (8594/ 9621) 
and i just can not imagine i had dogs and cats we did and i loved it and i just think kids need that and it is just a different kind of love i think you know they learn from it and 

Recording: (8595/ 9621) 
um probably would have been about six years ago i mean in six or seventh grade 

Recording: (8596/ 9621) 
i did have a a part time job i loved it it was just four hours a day but they wanted me to go full time and i just did not feel like i wanted to go full time so i was working as a receptionist and uh answering the phone doing some light filing just a variety of task office type task and i really liked it i liked the hours but i did not want to go eight hours compared to four so i left 

Recording: (8597/ 9621) 
and it is it is one color tax no pictures so you always ask you what things look like and then you do not can not tell them and too it is like the computers are all screwed up like you type in you know like typing computers and they will say we do not have them but we obviously do in life and you will look at it in a different way and you will be able to find them like it is uh it is really weird i do not understand 

Recording: (8598/ 9621) 
are you sure i 

Recording: (8599/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (8600/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (8601/ 9621) 
i think there is a heck of a lot more to it than what we have probably ever know uh you know they they really have not checked into the background of the parents you know as to what their beliefs were and everything uh you know i think that is a shame because you know you mentioned it before about something actually happening anymore of some kids shoots another kid you know and then the parents are are responsible for it and everything you know these two kids deliberately one in two kill and they wanted to kill more than what they killed uh then they kill themselves so we have never know from they are important why they did it but i think there is got to be something that we could find out from you know uh from their parents as to how they live you know they could have been in anything you know they could have been down there they could have been making him make an even do it you know 

Recording: (8602/ 9621) 
i am from here columbus ohio yeah 

Recording: (8603/ 9621)

Recording: (8604/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8605/ 9621) 
right  

Recording: (8606/ 9621) 
i think it should be the parents responsibility but i have no objection to them teaching it somewhat in the schools i guess 

Recording: (8607/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8608/ 9621) 
well i mean 

Recording: (8609/ 9621)

Recording: (8613/ 9621) 
i uh his wife is a teacher and i understand an excellent teacher so i think he has real good information uh that he works with well i think she maybe uh retired last year but she had a a top gone this for twenty years or something like that and so i think its information is good but i guess the way he handles things sometimes it is giving to people  

Recording: (8614/ 9621) 
potable certain things but they they want everything the same they can not be they can not be the same it is just a natural thing but the thing is let them do what they that is a god get them town what you had there kind of nurse and how many refuse of nurse voluntarily do they have children why talking to a women folk why do you have why i do not want to you have the natural ability to give all the all the natural protein the am usedization things all that maternal milk white cans instead of getting off the shelf

umhum 

Recording: (8628/ 9621) 
it is so dirty i wish they would clean it up more umi really really hate it one way of streets and once you get the hang of it they are a blessing because you are in downtown and all of a sudden dinged in you need any you see like twelve green lights in a row and you are just like you go fast as you can and try and get them all at the same time you know mind you if you are doing that anytime during the day that will not happen because you have got cars all around you but at night it is pretty fun and you just floor it and fly right to the middle of the downtown um improvements i would just say i would just say the name this place is thirty 

Recording: (8629/ 9621) 
something that know baseball 

Recording: (8630/ 9621)

it was we had a low gallery um we were in clentonville for a year or so and then we moved to grand view and it was just fine art we call it fine art crafts and it was hand made stuff from local people and we had a lot of jewelry and pottery and paintings that kind of stuff 

Recording: (8635/ 9621) 
you know he says it eagles mc squareed i say it is eagles mcc used because the world is three dimension it is not too dimension uh two dimension limits and everything but you look at history of a relatively all of our mathematicalical 

Recording: (8636/ 9621) 
no i think we are only friends inside the class i mean a lot of them i have known from from middle school in fall on the top and you know they just all go to their different areas like the one girl i was friends with had little park they means she was a great lower than me but one that we seen at each other in the hall say hey was something and we talk and you know what is going on and we are doing this after school and that and my school i did not know anything i i knew she was bad  and that was it  

Recording: (8637/ 9621) 
i know that is okay i i just do not want to touch it 

Recording: (8638/ 9621) 
it was just like that i am telling you it was and we would see you know they would put things on the on the screen for us to watch i i mean i learned a lot of stuff it was very a very good experience i went through very good 

Recording: (8639/ 9621) 
well i do not really like the i do not i do not i really do not like that job but uh you know i like the people there but it is like uh way to busy i think 

Recording: (8640/ 9621) 
and the baby is due may thirtieth and graduation is june second 

Recording: (8641/ 9621) 
a two girls he is a little cross the street from him today they are still we have good friends of mine they live down the circle guy across the street is gate i worked in game r one time i was the only straight person in there every girl walkinger she come right to me they will 

Recording: (8642/ 9621) 
that would be good 

Recording: (8643/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (8644/ 9621) 
oh i do not really think so i think of myself as kind of an inpatient person but i guess i do not i guess i do not i do not get as shocked by some of the things they do as some people do and i do not yell and scream at them and i mean i made realize they did not ask to have a learning disability i mean and then they can not they are not some teachers think they will just being religious and stuff they wanna straighten up they could and when i tried to tell those teachers this they can not change their learning disability anymore and you can change your brown eyes you know they were born with it it is genetic someone else in their family has it they can learn they just do not learn the same way everybody else does you have to break it down in the pieces or teach the different ways like teaching them math problem and two different ways you get the same answer but one way works better for you well that is how they are you know maybe they do not learn well by listening maybe they do not learn by well by looking at a chart or something maybe they only learn well when they are up moving around doing something you know you just have to understand that their avenues of learning are like different than yours and totally some of them might be totally screwed up like they might hear half of what you say or they might jump up what you say you say turn the page three ninety three or and they turn to three thirty nine in their book you know and they think they did what you said it is just like something is mixed up between the actual eye in the ear and then where it gets interpreted into the brain it gets all scramled somehow and i always tell teachers if you could just walk uh for one day in their shoes you would probably have a lot of apathy for them 

Recording: (8645/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8646/ 9621) 
hm 

Recording: (8647/ 9621)

Recording: (8650/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (8651/ 9621)

Recording: (8652/ 9621) 
well i know uh it was not supposed about twelve or something like that uh twelve thirteen fourteen range you know she even came and real van with her mom 

Recording: (8653/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8654/ 9621)

about once a week my wife sees are usually more than 

Recording: (8722/ 9621) 
right that is right yeah so that that was interesting and when we went to church up hamilton and over to uh and on more so up new albany road to more so than over to high street none of that commercial stuff was out there on more sl road i do not know if you know more road very well but there is it out out by carl there is shopping center after shopping center after shopping center  after housing development after but when we did this in the mid sixties when we drove up that way in the early sixties there was they were fields they were farms they were  uh they were forest you know none of that stuff out there and it is just it is just amazing the urban spring all that is taken over out there 

Recording: (8723/ 9621) 
humum 

Recording: (8724/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (8725/ 9621) 
umhum right there 

Recording: (8726/ 9621) 
you know to get a a four or five dollar a year tax cut 

Recording: (8727/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8728/ 9621) 
it should be able but they are neat the students that are at the other end need to help too a lot of people think if you have a child that is gifted did all your problems or solved it is not it is a different set of problems there is a personality of crooks that go with anymore issues 

Recording: (8729/ 9621) 
i raise them the best way i can 

Recording: (8730/ 9621) 
during the depression my grandfather uh moved over here and then asked her 

Recording: (8731/ 9621) 
right willing to do that again 

Recording: (8732/ 9621) 
right right  

Recording: (8733/ 9621) 
yeah it is like the uh the woman that used to live in the apartment where we live before us see she had a husband she is married to for quite some time he got on oh i have number one d e i list with eighteen d e i is oh man can you imagine how much money he is put into that i mean you think your first do i offense will be about thousand dollars fine in weekend in jail or something but eight feet them and you are racking up all that money and all those legal bills and all that time i think he is in jail now 

Recording: (8734/ 9621) 
civil rights um i i take the extreme position that civil rights are an allusion um yeah they are on paper which is a good thing because it was a terrible thing when uh there were laws that restricted someone because of their ethnic background or because of their is the but i think in many ways it has had little effect on creating an equal unfair society uh i believe maybe somebody leftist positions will come out right now uh people have the freedom but i believe that based upon where we are in the social strategy you were born in the united states uh you have a a limited ability to move up with and that the these class i mean i i do not want to say class lines because that has so many like historical connotations because it is not the exact same it is a class was in the marxist sense but class lines still today very much um fellow race lines and what good is like knowing that you have the freedom to vote when you know painfully well that you are not going to be able to get a job that is going to buy a house for your family and let them live in relative comfort i mean in in real terms in things i think are valuable to the individual 

Recording: (8735/ 9621) 
yeah for everybody so it is kind of a really big deal and my parents are the oldest from from their families too so it is a first great grandchild and and with um my husband he and it is his he he is the oldest so for everybody 

Recording: (8736/ 9621) 
i do not know where i am going to find to honestly i am thinking it was good to be doing a career for they 

Recording: (8737/ 9621) 
so yeah 

Recording: (8738/ 9621) 
or limited very limited 

Recording: (8739/ 9621) 
it is an island put it plant together i liked it there i kind of like and i figure they will probably hook up but i do not like how this show this show and this happened with deep space and i do and even with next generation for a little bit how the shows become soap opera like um i mean the romantic aspect of the stories do not really appeal to me very much um i am more interested in the social things and you know good old special effects um but uh i i think i like that how it is kept with a sort of a tension and it is not like you know they are not completely thrown together like uh bal on and tom which i do not like that at all 

Recording: (8740/ 9621) 
biddle is not that much dirt  so uh whenever they we heard any firing like that was coming to our door does by we would in for that whole 

Recording: (8741/ 9621) 
i have uh five hour of course the first term of summer quarter 

Recording: (8742/ 9621) 
yeah yes you might make millions you could retire your own  really 

Recording: (8743/ 9621) 
is that right 

Recording: (8744/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8745/ 9621) 
i did not know that 

Recording: (8746/ 9621) 
totally left that part out no one is something to me in about no throwing up or anything that that really made any sense 

Recording: (8747/ 9621) 
i used think it is a different time now i do not think uh i think everybody is living more for a day to talk about the future you know hoping it the future is there i think there is uh quote unquote uh in time aspect of life you know 

Recording: (8748/ 9621) 
you know now 

Recording: (8749/ 9621) 
okay good 

Recording: (8750/ 9621) 
i am trying to create organic in my head and 

Recording: (8751/ 9621) 
well did you spend much to utah doing it besides stocking 

Recording: (8752/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8753/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (8754/ 9621) 
but you understand what i am saying it is you are going to have to make make it so the guns that you got are harder to concealed 

Recording: (8755/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8756/ 9621) 
right right and that yeah and again if it is criminal activity you want some you want somebody to stop it and know about it but if it is i i am not doing anything i want anybody to know about so you know i am am am ever less to prevent them from going to the same idea i want some companies doing what research they that is a that is a threat on the web too is that you can connect into somebody is system and they do not know you are there and you can see what they are doing if they are doing research uh you know developing a new product or something you can you know it is that is going on and i have heard cases of ityeah well and the thing is people are real sharp no matter what you do they will find a way or what you know they have found a way to prevent people from getting in and people are real good about finding new ways to do it 

Recording: (8757/ 9621) 
but it it teaching him discipline responsibility you can not do these things at this time you know i 

Recording: (8758/ 9621) 
i i am sure it makes it easier but i think that a person can establish a relationship you just have to put the effort into it and decide to have that relationship and so i think that even if i were working you know as my oldest daughter i worked by range my life around her so that even i had that degree i waited tables because when she was little before she started school i could go to work at five in the evening and she went to bed at seven thirty so i had her with with her all day now when she started school i switched over to lunches and so i have always arranged my life around my children so i have an opportunity to be with that 

Recording: (8759/ 9621) 
well they were none of my friends that were pregnant and i am not sure they you know i just remember a couple girls that were pregnant i do not i were not was not friends with them and i am not sure about who their boyfriend is war or anything like that 

Recording: (8760/ 9621) 
a building or some car gets what we get see 

Recording: (8761/ 9621) 
um we are both i have gotten kind of bad uh but my husband is a mary is on train or i try to run with her at least two to three times a week because she is he is too fast for her um but we go to like hoffman farms up in off of cause grain i am not sure if it is in hoosiers but uh we take it under the saota park 

Recording: (8762/ 9621) 
my father moved here yes 

Recording: (8763/ 9621) 
hum but the third trouble is we do not fit the horse with the proper carryage load and we need to do that in our society we need to work as a team there is no sense having having five yards in the basketball team if you do not have this in it can tip it off in rebound 

Recording: (8764/ 9621) 
yeah yeah they do 

Recording: (8765/ 9621) 
well i i starts with with allowing uh here there are two mommy is 

Recording: (8766/ 9621) 
yeah i think basically normal hours would be like eight to twelve and then you go home during lunch times that is a big meal a day you go home and eat with your family that is really important 

Recording: (8767/ 9621) 
it is just a rule 

Recording: (8768/ 9621) 
that was this one guy and uh so i do not know how many several words of sheep need to hire uh i think they were mexicans 

Recording: (8769/ 9621) 
so it is very part time and i am full time student so i was working somewhere else before but it was i needed somewhere on campus 

Recording: (8770/ 9621) 
where she works and this is just something that she was breast cancer play so 

Recording: (8771/ 9621) 
he he is going to that is part of life you pick up something to learn it and you can not go on 

Recording: (8772/ 9621) 
eating away 

Recording: (8773/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (8774/ 9621) 
does not have any words in it like exhausted bait or run doubtly i will tell you that  

Recording: (8775/ 9621) 
um yeah across the street to dental and hospital so people were really allowed down there 

Recording: (8776/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8777/ 9621) 
basically they did not legally adopt them or anything but they are the ones that he considerations his family really and i mean he still keeps in contact with his mom instead but it is always kind of a challenge 

Recording: (8778/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8779/ 9621) 
why are you doing it now but and then my my by youngest one she likes to dress totally different she is sort of like a little bit of a preppie but she uh does not understand why people want to have like eyes on on their shirt or you know a name on their pants and she says i just think that is stupid she says you can buy nice clothes without that so she is neither one of impression me and uh the one thing that was really odd when they were little is we would go like to toys around and up and down the road and i see kids it is like you know and they would walk over and pick something up and go and then put it back down and keep walking and it is like you know i told choices you know i feel like i am in over because are they terrified to even ask for this stuff and she goes no she says they do not want it she says they just want to see what it is like you know because their favorite storm when they were little is i would go to um what do you call it lazy boy and get five or six of them killer boxes from the sofa and the chairs and take a nice then cut doors in it and they would play with that for weeks you know until somebody one of their friends would come over and have a little accident in and we would go well we have to build a new house but you know they just reading and playing with stuff like that they they enjoy it you know so 

Recording: (8780/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (8781/ 9621) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (8782/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8783/ 9621) 
so i was like in shape very well  i was in very good shape 

Recording: (8784/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8785/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8786/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (8787/ 9621) 
um so i mean basically my opinion on that is just leave it up to them i mean if they want to take the risks obviously they know  

Recording: (8788/ 9621) 
no they should talk about i think they should talk about that too um i never i never did it and i you know i wish i could have waited so i was married but i you know you are going through that whatever you go see when you are a teenager so you are like so what well most kids i am not you know some people some kids still do that but i think i guess i do think they should put that in it also that 

Recording: (8789/ 9621) 
i work at uh company company plus i help out at the bba noby and on by their association 

Recording: (8790/ 9621) 
yes and no i mean in high school there is a bunch of little things here it is not so much a lot of things 

Recording: (8791/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (8792/ 9621) 
everybody needs to know about information just for credit card 

Recording: (8793/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (8794/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (8795/ 9621) 
now this is most of my painting is were completed uh before uh like nineteen ninety five nineteen ninety six before it came back out it was more of a thing like image from my childhood coming back out and now it suddenly uh you hear about it more often so that is not a little funny about used to be probably like i am paying star wars 

Recording: (8796/ 9621) 
high on their horse yeah  some of them are too 

Recording: (8797/ 9621) 
yeah by i could my could imagine 

Recording: (8798/ 9621) 
i know exactly 

Recording: (8799/ 9621) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (8800/ 9621) 
yeah see they adjusted that but then they did not have anyway to um enforce that so 

Recording: (8801/ 9621) 
hopefully 

Recording: (8802/ 9621) 
 yeah i know i am definitely in favor of that i mean yes it is the parents it is the parent is supposed to do it and one would hope that the parent would get there before before the health class did but if the parent is not going to get there just the only way they are ever going to find out 

Recording: (8803/ 9621) 
that is what we figure in a few years they will be fine it is just getting there it is been very difficult i mean as kind of as we did not know where he was for a week or a week at a time he i just drive in the lane avenue once and so i am bagging money on the street and that is it is it is pretty heavy load to go through it really is 

Recording: (8804/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (8805/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (8806/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (8807/ 9621) 
in the meantime you know  you have got to pay the bills so i you know i am not sure which he wants to do he is had so many different kinds of jobs parttime jobs though um yeah i when she was younger like ten years ago she wanted to have her own talk show 

Recording: (8808/ 9621) 
been you know with people coming back later and saying that uh they they change their mind and stuff is the adoptive parents i would be concerned about that but that is not going to happen in this case i do not think and it because of for asianist now since to me the state law says that she has to have custody of child for seventy two hours before she can give it up for adoption uh because of her age and it does not make any sense to me but so they you know they are talking to a social worker now to find out they do not want to take the baby home because they are afraid of being too attached to it then and they do not think it is a good atmosphere for it because her mother is smokes constantly her mother is alcoholic uh they 

Recording: (8809/ 9621) 
because you do have to have the higher education most of the time to do anything these days so they definitely have to have their 

Recording: (8810/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8811/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (8812/ 9621) 
actually you can have well they usually go together some kids have learn disabilities without the a phd and some have a phd without the learning disability and some have both and you can have he without having the higheractive part you can have the tension deficit in this order with what they call high pro activity and that is the student that is kind of spacey and kind of dreamy and they never cause any trouble but they are kind of like out of touch with the oldity and they are always looking out the window and like the other one that says i did not hear one what was the question and uh they are they are ad and they can not quite focus and they can not screen out the extractions but because they are not hyper they are not always doing this and they are not bothering people they are kind of the they are the ones that usually get lost in the shuttle these are the kids that are real cooperative and they are always smiling they are kind of spaced out and daydream and and takes a long time to realize and this kid can not focus but with the kid that is all over the place and doing the to happen to this kid is chair and the kid goes make him stop in my chair you know  you you can see right away that he can not focus because when he asked you for help you can over to explain something to him he is like all over the place while your explaining is not listening he is trying to show him something he will not look at it you know it is like people often say edd kids can not focus or can not attend to anything but what is really happening is they attend everything 

Recording: (8813/ 9621) 
by stars what is your major need of pointing finger paints journalism and uh medicine okay cross words okay i gives our uh younger people some mentorors look after does not it and where are your scores and those uh oh i am uh gee i am just barely getting by in by i am just barely you know but that is a problem we have lack of standards no that is they are right keep a private but no i wish those guys would just spell hey i am a majoring in accounting i am majoring in i am majoring in business and i got three point five i got two point six oh and whatever the criteria is to play on the team why are not you playing this week well i am practicing i am still required to practice even though i can not play this week why can not you play this is it is a rule what rule well if i do not make certain things during the week which is academic i still have to perform uh sports wise make that commitment but if i do not fall if i fall through that then i will not have the same period but those are things that need need to be uh publicized more i understand they say well hey we brought this much ticket gate this month and he got this of course and this percentages that we need to expand more on that so that the younger people have better old models to look at and not just playing round ball or the the spiral we need to get them out there and say how you got perform in school you know i am sure michael reds got some mentorsors out there you see guys where number the way the number is eight and the way it was okay they get there is a reason for it but what is what is let us see other part of it we do not do it because why we do not want to bring them up though we do not want to bring them from the embarrassment possibly or but that is part of life when they get out in the real world i am talking about these guys some will be successful in terms of whoever and some will be successful in other people is eyes but the thing is show the kids they are watching them hey there is more than just sports sports is a backpack here to the high state 

Recording: (8814/ 9621)

Recording: (8815/ 9621)

Recording: (8816/ 9621) 
know nothing at all it it was known that he was the father but like i said i mean he he was kind of uh some of those kids and i mean he did not listen to anyone or anything and he ended up like running away from home basically and like i said going out to colorado and like i will just drive down there his car broke down his parents like wire to money for him to to get a plane ticket to come back they ended up just taking the money fixing this car with it and kept on going

Recording: (8869/ 9621) 
almost many mission film of the families living with the animals in the same house and you try to understand and and you will never they will never get away from poverty in the classes in our society that is just life or that is going to be that but thing is try to have understanding compassion for them not do it because they do not know they because they give it they do not do it so i i really i really think uh um i would always say traveling uh people are all the same world of mine they just give them different colors different face of different accents to so i can give them unique characters so they can call him his own he knows each of all of us but uh we are all the same way he said down talk about the emotions and the drive and she said they keep you asking you keep it one thing they can ask yourself and ask the business person what would you be doing today if you were born more than third world country how thankful are you that you are here and how to show that thankfulness 

Recording: (8870/ 9621) 
no they were from all over the world i had um one companion who was from russia but she was on a temporary mission i mostly all over america but there was a girl from mongol yeah uh there was girls there who i never was companions with them but they were from russia different there was a girl from moscow um my mission president was actually from saint peter isburg and his wife they they did not speak english at all 

Recording: (8871/ 9621) 
and they have on our classes which are separate and they are supposed to be with a better faculty and um smaller class size and a little more challenging 

Recording: (8872/ 9621)

Recording: (8874/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (8875/ 9621)

Recording: (8876/ 9621) 
so much of them more old have it valley still had a all of the men is and stuff they got you know the places where kids could go so 

Recording: (8877/ 9621) 
i um i have three brothers and sisters my parents are in the last eight i live with my mom and there is the three over there and then my dad is families i have a brother and a sister over there 

Recording: (8878/ 9621) 
now that kids are carrying knives and guns and things to school you never know if you are going to walk into the building and maybe not go home that day 

Recording: (8879/ 9621) 
uhknowledge puts everything i need at my fingertips uh i mean uh i think that something that would not have happened had there not been a uh of a highly the highly populous generation suddenly that was competing them within itself 

Recording: (8880/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (8881/ 9621) 
i disagree with society there it should be something you work with it is just like hey well let us let me go ahead this year well brian uh we are going to have a losing season uh i do not care 

Recording: (8882/ 9621) 
just can not go on i thought if they are going to stop it totally 

Recording: (8883/ 9621) 
uh we would ride uh the bus downtown all the major uh stores were down there um uh there was a restaurant called mills restaurant uh you know it was all you know glass you could see through there and they were different uh levels uh white table cloth

Recording: (8885/ 9621) 
you get lost in mathematics almost i think you could of course now they probably have 

Recording: (8886/ 9621) 
yeah poor jobs of macaroni cheese 

Recording: (8887/ 9621) 
by the minor league hockey kind of columbus jail whenever they are they do not have it now but uh because of blue jackers that can be out but but i think it would be good if it goes but i am just not sure that columbus is going to support something like that colbathist going to support something like that and it is basically the high state you know and they do not even support the uh hocky came we got for the high state you know and yet they are good 

Recording: (8888/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (8889/ 9621) 
and i think that is probably why i feel the way i do now 

Recording: (8890/ 9621) 
yeah  

Recording: (8891/ 9621) 
i do not know but if everybody is ever gone i am gonna i will i will find some i am sure

no 

Recording: (8894/ 9621)

Recording: (8901/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8902/ 9621) 
put my hand here to keep it out of the line of the wire 

Recording: (8903/ 9621) 
well i mean most of it was me going over at with them and just you know i talked to some people and they recommended this and recommended that and then i looked at it and you know just doing the things that worked for him as an individual 

Recording: (8904/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (8905/ 9621) 
um well just even like the parks 

Recording: (8906/ 9621) 
umhum ten thousand dollars fine  oh man talk about cutting the coupon there i mean 

Recording: (8907/ 9621) 
and make them do their webbing and get their rough draft started and then they can go to the computer because they i find they they are a little more creative when they get the think about adding pictures and we call it publishing it when you get to the publishing stage 

Recording: (8908/ 9621) 
difficult to fine 

Recording: (8909/ 9621) 
okay someone come in and say well off with your head 

Recording: (8910/ 9621) 
my dad was cripp uh for nine months he was in the classroom just neck down to his ankles 

Recording: (8911/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8912/ 9621) 
have you ever heard him speak 

Recording: (8913/ 9621) 
is that right 

Recording: (8914/ 9621) 
you know i did not realize because i used to love peanut butter you know on coast and crackers i go home you know and because there was a lot of coaching for me not eating meat and it you know it kind of satisfied me but uh the doctor took a couple tests and uh he realized it was the peanutsance which i would have never thought of that because i ate it for so long all my life 

Recording: (8915/ 9621) 
two years or senior is in high school i mean it was not anything too serious it was just more i guess it test asked for on trip or something 

Recording: (8916/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8917/ 9621) 
yes it is to democrat  

Recording: (8918/ 9621) 
yeah by then it was junior year when we were wrestling and everyone just figured it was two more years left they could just struggle through it 

Recording: (8919/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8920/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8921/ 9621) 
because they would not let them one while i was there 

Recording: (8922/ 9621) 
yeah talking about all these under age kids thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen even up to eighteen years old uh column mind shooting i mean all those just relate in one category that you know it is getting out of control here but they will do something  

Recording: (8923/ 9621) 
and fired him 

Recording: (8924/ 9621) 
umhum yes and old and old eyesore that they should have got rid of years again but 

Recording: (8925/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8926/ 9621) 
so the the original father did not live in around for the kid 

Recording: (8927/ 9621) 
umhum right 

Recording: (8928/ 9621) 
yeah it is a good idea 

Recording: (8929/ 9621) 
the court 

Recording: (8930/ 9621) 
but then again i feel like sometimes i am so naive i mean a lot of that was not introduced and it was just like well should i have known that 

Recording: (8931/ 9621) 
yes they do 

Recording: (8932/ 9621) 
and i do not know whether or not he is never said anything if he is but uh i think money out of it could be uh they the guys that you know uh the the guys that come out very boondly in favor of uh publicizing it and all that i do not think that they do gain anything by it 

Recording: (8933/ 9621) 
yeah but my new grandma  

Recording: (8934/ 9621) 
i think one of the thing is that we when when your backtides is that you are really supposed to help other people to like if if you somebody gives you a gift you want to give it to someone else but it is easy a lot of times just to fall into the you know like mold of not letting anyone know what you believe and just so they think oh what are those weird oves you know they do not wear makeup or whatever but we we can wear makeup if we want  but so i think for a lot of times people do fall in just sort of but i i was not raised at mormon so i have a lot of my family and friends who are still not members of the church and also because it is so new to me that i am just you know i will talk about it with anybody and and and and so and i am also not afraid of people who are not mormon is because i think if you go up like a member of the church and you might be more afraid of people that do not believe like you have been taught uh i think a lot of the you know we do not drink alcohol we do not there is a lot of restrictions i guess you call them restrictions but they are out i feel like they are more just house codes to keep you healthy and so um it might be it is like if we if america you know we are we used to being raised one way if we went to another country just kind of like you might want to get to know the chinese people but you might not quite be a little timid about you know it is the same kind of thing but i i am not i do not have any of those bearings 

Recording: (8935/ 9621) 
wow i mean 

Recording: (8936/ 9621) 
pedly but uh 

Recording: (8937/ 9621) 
uh couple that are talking to the baby we get counseling for her 

Recording: (8938/ 9621) 
one year fifty five or or is it sixty two whatever age is an age limitation age or you base point age or disability or being out of town uh you are allowed so routinely we have done done the out of i mean done the uh absentee over the years no going back to basic politicians i i i think we have uh i think the last majority uh are truly good honest people they try to mean well i am i am concerned always that uh people who go into politics they are in fine shape when they start but that the tremendous influences are brought to bear that they never had had the opportunity to comprehend before they got there and they are just overwhelmed and and and i do not necessarily think it is a it is a a dishonesty it is like a title way they get caught up and they can not resist the direction it is being put or they are being pushed 

Recording: (8939/ 9621) 
and now it is our turn to deal with the issues we see our parents we see this generation that all these things they are still populous so we do not look down on the sixty i mean i think the sixty sounds like a pretty fun time to live i will get into politics in a second um but those things are popularized but no we can not do it any more because we have got these problems 

Recording: (8940/ 9621) 
well i will come back i mean you need me to 

Recording: (8941/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (8942/ 9621) 
and just sort of like whenever it comes on i roll my eyes that episode where they were stuck out in space and uh just if the tape can catch me rolling my eyes and so 

Recording: (8943/ 9621) 
and then i am probably going to be working on my poor fully of the second term 

Recording: (8944/ 9621) 
oh northland 

Recording: (8945/ 9621) 
and uh so i got some of the inside dope on the area from him but uh they had they have uh i do not know whether it had been a large greenery or something that had a concrete floor and some industrial ti had chipped the hole about so big around than that 

Recording: (8946/ 9621) 
yeah i am okay yeah it is only it is still ten to seven yeah 

Recording: (8947/ 9621) 
well uh yeah but what would you send it if you could send it to one of the tv rooms that have like uh oprah one fairer is that one thing that can get it all over the world you know all over the united states or something so people really hear it maybe if they might do some good up people would begin to speak up you know why do not they start some type of a television program with questions like this and what to people really think it would help to do instead of having things like oh poor in fence who is those other other couple guys that get on to ask the most stupid questions and 

Recording: (8948/ 9621) 
but i have never done i do not want to but to me some drugs should be legal some drugs should be illegal but to me alcohol should be more illegal than half your drugs 

Recording: (8949/ 9621) 
hom uh sexuality i guess 

Recording: (8950/ 9621) 
no i mean 

Recording: (8951/ 9621) 
but at the same time i do not think i would really hold it against him 

Recording: (8952/ 9621) 
oh my gosh one of those that do not like you know falling down the trees  

Recording: (8953/ 9621) 
and we would uh i just the guns called down shift so they could come within reasonable close to that 

Recording: (8954/ 9621) 
ah because she has been known to help herself to bread  and she actually jumped up on the table and looked around and took a piece of bread and i am like oh my gosh 

Recording: (8955/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8956/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (8957/ 9621) 
yeah and i i got to argue about stuff there here i am just kind of sitting around  

Recording: (8958/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (8959/ 9621) 
you like the university level 

Recording: (8960/ 9621) 
actually being able to to recent the funding but still i mean it is a it is we do not like to think about these things happening 

Recording: (8961/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (8962/ 9621) 
and i do not know whether i am not i do not think the second sister ever went to school out there but uh things were so tough that and mom had taught school in iowa where she grew up and uh got her teacher is certificate so i guess in they would agree that if they could find someone to they would ask answer to the day she could teach 

Recording: (8963/ 9621) 
no not really i do not know what even is to eat down here awfullys 

Recording: (8964/ 9621) 
well uh let us see i got divorced when i oldest was three and my youngest was about six months almost a year so i have i have raised them basically myself yeah so i did go back to work 

Recording: (8965/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (8966/ 9621) 
it is just like being good numbers 

Recording: (8967/ 9621) 
um it is kind of funny you are allowed to drink before you are allowed to drive 

Recording: (8968/ 9621) 
i was a baby you know under one  

Recording: (8969/ 9621) 
there is too much information and too much change uh library is that this is against probably what the image of the library is uh they are very very eager to increase change uh internet came out and you know when it and when it got out of the area of it was being used by universities or whatever for research that sort of was at first my brains were right there and they went in more and more and they want to figure out what they can do with it uh with pcs we just you know it was revolution i mean we announced if it could use ibm pcs to access to the system if we would provide you software you can do some of the work that you used to doing but without in your computer and it is like it was incredible the uh we had trouble with the demand it was you know they triple what we expected my brian is were ready for it 

Recording: (8970/ 9621) 
and uh it it is great we have been re engineered the last eight years oh downizing and trying to fit the uh uh fit the i guess the what the person brings at work as opposed to one of the problems that i see as an as an employer or as a supervisor manager in a lot of times we have to promote because well the bureaucracy says you have to do this and we are going up there they do not quite consider getting the attibutes that person has and so now we are saying okay if you bring this attitude to the table and you can help the team out then might not reward you instead of putting you over here in let us say a man is jury jury position which you we do not have any call for but you are there because of money only okay so we are trying to fit the attitude to the person and compensate them accordingly which uh hey i think we did that we would probably have more teachers 

Recording: (8971/ 9621) 
and why do not people use their time you know and it is free you know rather they get all fenced up and mad because they less five minutes late and expect everybody to get out of their way because they got to get there you know 

Recording: (8972/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (8973/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (8974/ 9621) 
and the house smells wonderful you know it is like cakes uh birthday cakes you know i think but my i think my wife was with the last one i i make her one and you know we we trade off and i bought a uh uh what is it betty crockercker at odd lots it was twenty two cents the iceing was twenty two cents i made it and everybody goes this is really good it is like a sour cream iceing and again they go boy this is really good and they go did you buy this and i go no i made it and they go really and i go yeah it costs me forty four cents 

Recording: (8975/ 9621) 
there is no need to attack students over it and i read some article in the luncheon i do not know why read that um um i hate that paper anyway um i read some articles that the guy said he is not trying to attack students he just wants them to get enough so they will go fine to their parents about how the university does it and then they can all fight the establishment and 

Recording: (8976/ 9621) 
but like if you said i while i am a bus service will go and pick you guys up you know and then then you can not use the excuse my car broke down or something and then like if you even to give them like they are not going to have to be hot you know i would think for breakfast or anything you know if you run three shifts you can just you know here is a box of dough or something you know and that does not cost the company that much can 

Recording: (8977/ 9621) 
uh uh just a player you know i mean they lost a four or five different uh top notch players that went to the pros and most of them are starting or you know so uh oh cooperous thing is we do not rebuild we unload you know well sometimes it takes a couple years to unload you know but i have never been to ab i have not seen a cooperated soi was listening to a or not corby uh some show on wtv and i listen to talk shows and everything and uh he supposedly has said something to uh he had got ready to assistant coach they supposedly said something to him one assistant coach that did you know i would like to hard you and everything but you are not the right color you know i mean that is not something that you would think the head coach of the high state would say you know 

Recording: (8978/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (8979/ 9621) 
tubes and all that i remember seeing that like in eighth grade and looking at that thinking that is neat you know 

Recording: (8980/ 9621) 
uhhuh i learned about them from uh somebody i was working with who liked them and listened to a lot of their music and he loaned me some and i taped it and i saw their video their wall street career video i do not know if you have ever seen that it is fun  it was fun 

Recording: (8981/ 9621) 
um i helped them set up different things helped them you know clean them up after words prep patients all kinds of different things there was a lot of blood and stuff but i do not know when when it is not you it seems a little easier to observe i guess yeah when you see somebody you know it is a little more concerning to you i do not know but you see a lot of different stuff and you hope that the majority of it is helping this person out now my wife you know she works she works in intensive care open arts arts surgery different patients like that and that is a lot different than where she is now with the cancer because there is so many different factors there here you know and she says it is so hard to see somebody thirty years old and they come in and they have uh express cancer or something like that and you have to go in and tell them these things she says you know two or three times a week you know your your heart just drops out because you see that they have their little kids and now you are going to be going for came upys and all that stuff you know and it is unbelievable how many it is just hard to believe how many people go through there they are talking fifty sixty patients that 

Recording: (8982/ 9621) 
you know and i mean it do not matter to me whether your black or white it matters to me whether you are white you treat me like when i first got out of services when they really started off our back i was gonna get a job in the truck in the industry and they could not hire me because uh that was one that first come down to the manate to they going to hire black 

Recording: (8983/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (8984/ 9621) 
the risk again what goes into it and like i said i mean it does not really hurt anyone that high part of it 

Recording: (8985/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8986/ 9621) 
and it is interesting that they advertise that when you go there though if you get that room that is what you get 

Recording: (8987/ 9621) 
so and they and they they they they could tend to they all they will eat all day  cats  yeah you just you just you just that you just you just put them put them in jail yeah that is all that that that is that that is that is our whole life you know 

Recording: (8988/ 9621) 
i that went that went there for class center in high school and that was something that was exciting for me but that is totally all the question for me now because i have a kid and there is no way i would do that 

Recording: (8989/ 9621) 
so like thirty of them will go out at one time and thirty will come back well that is not too bad but they are mixed in with everybody else that is normally flying like all the airlines and stuff so and they want to get their aarp so you know i i just do not feel comfortable doing that much at one time i mean not that i wish you was not a was not a uh dead place you know it was very busy it is like the third business in ohio but uh yeah it is amazing and they are only open sixteen hours a day 

Recording: (8990/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (8991/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8992/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (8993/ 9621) 
um actually i guess it is something that is always sort of been there have always been real big on just building things i mean been real big hands on and last summer i hope my dad uh put a garage under his house um make him mean literally i mean we have poured the foundation and everything and i built everything up from there and it turned out really well and i mean it is really fun to do i mean it is i like it a lot better than being stuck inside all the time 

Recording: (8994/ 9621) 
gun control i am not really too interested in i mean you look at israel people are carrying guns on the street big huge guns and they are one of the safest nations in the country then you look at england they have no guns at all and they are relatively safe so i mean 

Recording: (8995/ 9621) 
yeah get my loan share control  

Recording: (8996/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (8997/ 9621)

Recording: (9006/ 9621) 
like i am not i am not really sure like how they how the interview works to become a teacher um i do not know i think it is like a lot of times they are really desperate to find people and so they really just take whoever i mean they are lucky enough to even have a body to fill this this place and they are doing well enough i mean the kids are they material i mean sort of i mean i i mean i it is working well enough i guess i mean it is just that like people are learning things and they come wanting to go into college and stuff

that would be like you know going to the hell they they putting on some kind of gay raise to make a gayumhum yeah 

Recording: (9010/ 9621) 
yeah yeah we probably eventually we will do that but i am like so up in the air about what i want to do and there is so many things to do out there that i need to take time to think about it 

Recording: (9011/ 9621) 
it is like dealing with this adoption of the baby we know that that is best but dealing with the emotions of it this is it this is great we are very family oriented and this this is a grand child will never see 

Recording: (9012/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (9013/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (9014/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9015/ 9621) 
it 

Recording: (9016/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9017/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (9018/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9019/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (9020/ 9621) 
yeah i can not what you i can fit it in i was easy major  why did you become a psych major oh okay yeah that basically is just great to get out  you knowyou know the psychology class and i do not think i i do not know it can be it is like major it is just a little a little too a little too intimidating to me it is like lots of like all that fordian stuff it is just it is just i it just it says wow this is this is blow my mind and so i said okay spanish looks good  so i just said degree so i can just get out and go and travel  like you say a lot of these companies a lot of these like you say well you know i do not i do not know what their requirements are for for some of these jobs over in europe they maybe it is like as long as you have a any sort of like degree you know they will take you clerical or whatever  because i am from limit  because i am from limit yeah uh no i did not live at honda but it was like i did not want to pay out of state out of state residence at least as i could like if i went to indiana and got got away from that thing god  uh actually i lived that lake uh river watch tower is on lane avenue and it is much nicer than the dorms  oh and it is like right across the  oh yeah it is like i i guess it is kind of like a hospital if i you know hospital is i use a okay hospital environment so the buyments i can they just get to the next they buy the pay mentioned apartment and the whole you know floor you know you have come friends with everybody going through that so i am hoping that is the same deal when i travel it is like it is easy to make friends and hook up and you know say oh you can a job you know it was like you know hook me up 

Recording: (9021/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (9022/ 9621) 
i mean come on who was not picked on you know 

Recording: (9023/ 9621) 
she got divorced when i was three 

Recording: (9024/ 9621) 
you do not you do not use coupons 

Recording: (9025/ 9621) 
which is not really not a lot 

Recording: (9026/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (9027/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9028/ 9621) 
then you can go visit what the upires that the big thing like the stature liberty 

Recording: (9029/ 9621) 
it is yeah because pediatricians are able to just spend state and um um i just you know felt like trying to avoid it as much as possible you know growing up 

Recording: (9030/ 9621) 
but when you look at coming he they things there was a point where they they asked a yes or no question 

Recording: (9031/ 9621) 
um this is sherry 

Recording: (9032/ 9621) 
i i been impressed them like okay i tried to build a car and it did not look like anything 

Recording: (9033/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (9034/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9035/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (9036/ 9621) 
yeah i think so i think so and they they just you know the candidates really seem like they have that much integrity to me you know so 

Recording: (9037/ 9621) 
that is probably family by family i means that we  that is why i was a little bit late leaving work the way it was there there we have got two coworkers one um has her child at the same day care as as myself she is about a year now and i am listening to her and i mean she is there you know sixty seventy hours a week i mean she is jobed off at six am and not picked up till six thirty p m and she is fine with that me personally there is no way because somebody is totally in my opinion raising that child you are not getting to put your values your traditions what is important to you onto that child now the other girls she just has a four month old in has been in day care now for three weeks and she is going to go she she is going to quit her job and go to um um night working nights three days a week because it is important to her to be at home with him 

Recording: (9038/ 9621) 
so she so i probably did learn a little bit because i i she still that she lives with the man now and he does all the cooking still so i have i have learned everything on my own upon cooking and stuff like that which i did love to cook 

Recording: (9039/ 9621) 
i think society of today of today is less tolerant of uh a lot of things that they see where people getting along with this stuff you know and they are more vocal about it as opposed to being behind it back in the sixties and stuff you know uh not here but you down south there people still getting hung and stuff you know for being a black or something and uh you know there are bad blacks and there are bad whites too you know so but not all them are uh you know are that white 

Recording: (9040/ 9621) 
um plus if they shoot somebody accidently number one it is really hard to and secondly it probably will kill them like a gun can um and you have to use your brain so i did not come from hunting background um but my husband does work for the state air patrols obviously we know a lot of people that have to carry guns but none of them hardly any of them hunt um you know a lot of them they respect them if you know what i mean they realize they can kill people well is the problem it is the people that are teaching 

Recording: (9041/ 9621) 
um so i am sure that probably increases the rate of public schools for them 

Recording: (9042/ 9621) 
um i do more summer sports but uh he is just beginning on the computer um i am pretty computer literally i have really never had a job yet and it is always been working with his or plan 

Recording: (9043/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (9044/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (9045/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (9046/ 9621) 
and you register them and then you just keep after them you keep giving them information and then you just run a good get out the vote campaign uh in ohio i think it is easier to do that because there is a law that i do not think it is in primaries but in general elections at eleven oclock in the morning and four oclock in the afternoon they have to list those who have voted they have to put up a list of uh registered voters and cross out those who who voted so what i used to do was i took my list that i had gotten from the board of elections earlier and compared it with my list of who had shown support or was undecided on the election and i would cross off those that had voted and then i had a list of those that had not and i had people waiting at a phone bank and i would call them at work or at home and and i would offer to take them to the polls if you do not have a ride uh we will take you to the polls if you are worried about it says someone watching your kids we have sort of five teachers who will sit in the car with your kid or will sit in your home and will babysit for you while you go to vote because i have also read studies that say people who are rounded from their home or their office you know to remind it to go vote will also vote for whatever issue or candidate has reminded them to do that because what i did was it is a very low key thing i would call people on election day and say hi this is roberto i am calling to remind you that today is election day and we hope that you will remember to exercise your most important freedom which is to go vote and oh by the way uh when you go to vote we hope that you will vote for us that is in such a school levy and if you need a right let me know we have got them set up for you and but you know that is very i mean and and that is not getting people to vote and encourage them to vote because they should that is a a special campaign for a particular issue or a candidate i do not know how you get people to vote i do not know why they do not think it is important maybe because we have had it too easy my my grandfather did not my grandfather did not i mean there was a king and queen and you know he had no right to vote so when he came here and he could that was the most important thing in the world to him you know in that he he just passed it on to you know his daughter my mother my father i do not know how he it was important to him but it was always important to him and we talked about politics at the dinner table sometimes we talked about issues and he said you know it is important to to be heard so i do not know if it was that it got passed on parentwise or what it was 

Recording: (9047/ 9621) 
um about fifteen minutes my mom and i do not go too far from each other so but jayson is going to take the week off and everything so i think that we will we will be able to do that 

Recording: (9048/ 9621) 
that is not right so i have always gotten two percent raises even though uh basically i have been cross trained or however you want to say it i can work in three or four areas where most people can not but i have seen people get ten percent raise i have seen me get two percent raise when i am doing three jobs and they are doing one 

Recording: (9049/ 9621) 
i do not want to get to it like the way we walk but i do not know what to do is find 

Recording: (9050/ 9621) 
yeah i think mostly they did uh i was kind of surprised uh which classes is i think this was in the pattern production to the arts class i was kind of surprised that one of the students in my class thought it was very hard  and i did not think it was that hard at all but she wrote me some kind of nasty note at the last class or before the last class that she had a straight a average at this school before that my class and i was giving her a b and she was her average was gonna be ruined and she felt i felt guilty about it  not really  not really i mean i had was grading on it pretty much of a curb i mean i was trying really not to flunk anybody that was that was attempting to do the work and i think i flunked one person that was really goofing off and uh but in terms of the curb i had a is i had bees i had a few seeves  yeah so yep i well  

Recording: (9051/ 9621) 
wow when you get into the black population you sometimes see some 

Recording: (9052/ 9621) 
whether they ever play a video game where they are shooting people i can not say see there is been something that affects them 

Recording: (9053/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (9054/ 9621) 
huh 

Recording: (9055/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (9056/ 9621)

just getting a couple of shirts or something you know she is always bought my clothes anyway so she is getting a couple of she is getting whatever you think i need you know i will be here drinking beer or what you know sports you know 

Recording: (9058/ 9621) 
little girl i i always think you should name a kid and i have opinions about everything see i think you should name a kid something that will fit him at eighty three and eight in in between like we named our son robert so when he was little he was robby now he is eighteen he is robb when he becomes an attorney or whatever he wants to do he can be robert paul you know and in kindergarten now i had learned to write with r o b or r o b b y so that it you know i have a hard time fixing an eighty three year old woman as ag 

Recording: (9059/ 9621) 
in actually not that difficult but 

Recording: (9060/ 9621) 
so i will the only one of them i a whole block 

Recording: (9061/ 9621) 
yeah but it is not a good way for me to make money because if you are farming out people or if you are better still drop it down a little if you are exchangeing hours for money or time for money then you have a fine amount of time and it is 

Recording: (9062/ 9621) 
uh well i think only because i went abroad i had basically one extra quarter beyond four years 

Recording: (9063/ 9621) 
so that i guess i do have some family  by marriage but they live near bloomington 

Recording: (9064/ 9621) 
in option 

Recording: (9065/ 9621) 
than 

Recording: (9066/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9067/ 9621) 
that is how i feel that is that is what i believe in i just believe that 

Recording: (9068/ 9621) 
so i you know i i just think the more you are open about things i just think that is the best why you know when you put things and do not talk about it that is when the problem starts 

Recording: (9069/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (9070/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (9071/ 9621)

Recording: (9112/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9113/ 9621) 
uh i did when i worked at possibly i worked at the hospital here over here where i am at i do not but i am in a big room like as big as a gym in the age you know and i am in there by myself 

Recording: (9114/ 9621) 
just one two three four five five four three two one 

Recording: (9115/ 9621) 
and i think some of my feelings about that sort of thing is uh is is colored by the fact that i collected data for twenty years from employers uh i am a lot more sympathetic to that sort of thing um 

Recording: (9116/ 9621) 
and my own civilian insurance i said you know why would you want to get up on the original you know why would you want to get up on the original and have a copy because all these others want to be it was not well in other words you felt christianity 

Recording: (9117/ 9621) 
the people who who really like my work happen to be the people who are vacationing from columbus though 

Recording: (9118/ 9621) 
the way those coming in is they wear like a like a it is a like a weight railroad 

Recording: (9119/ 9621)

Recording: (9120/ 9621) 
no the away fromps are only given out that day even the teachers do not know what they are going to be and it might be something as general as tell about your neighborhood or it might be something as specific as when you were little what toy was your most favorite and you would have to write five paragraphs on it so uh  

Recording: (9121/ 9621) 
i do not know what he pays he has but i know they park clear out over off the fulls and teansie river road and have to take like a bus in 

Recording: (9122/ 9621)

Recording: (9126/ 9621) 
to studying music for a while and then studying chemistry  yeah no i i i did not think of any projects where i can use those  

Recording: (9127/ 9621) 
pretty well they 

Recording: (9128/ 9621) 
it is it is amazing and that is something i know my husband we always joke about he talk tells this guys at work you know like um you know to take flowers for no reason you know well like like one guy was telling me he was saying some of their average and the other said well i can take flowers something and the guy goes oh i do not know and he said trust me take some flowers 

Recording: (9129/ 9621) 
well they are supposed to do more too but by the time they get the fourth grade they are so busy trying to be the class class they decide it is a lot more important to impress your friends than it is to fill your mind with knowledge 

Recording: (9130/ 9621) 
it it would be interesting to see how much of your generation is saving first of all how much are they earning how much they expect to pay for a house and all these other things you know they they say to you i i will say ten percent church then you got oh gee five dollars here or made twenty cents a twenty six hour here and get this you figure all those uh all these campaigns you hear during of course of the year i offer a hundred degrees from working take all those figures and add up see it adds up to a hundred percent if it does then where are your goals see when i bought a house the finance here came in i went to his office and he said uh i am interested no problem no problem you can get that house i said i can yeah you are professional and you are white professional i said that is how you evaluate it on both of us i said i do not want to do business with you why i am going to get you along i said i do not want to do business with you because you did not ask me about my goals my goals was not to have my wife work because nowadays it takes too many work i am just wondering when the child labor law agree with that because two men working i am wondering how many more hours a day you can squeeze of a couple personal life so they will have sanity at sometime in their life to enjoy life when these people start realizing hey if which is not our working than those two that that couple got wives that said hey we are going to do with less and we are going to go for quality what in that when that couple reaches that mentality mister do not officer you are going to have a greater society to work with and you will not have as many haphations i am sorry it goes against your goal but goes against it it is more positive for our society and that is been it my wife is been working part time all her to the same in is fine keep her license up she was nice but thing is i do not want i did not want her i wanted her to be home with the kids i did not want some else of your our kids and i do not know if our kids realize this or not but i do know my my my brotherinlaw mentioned to his uh parents that gosh what a sacrifice you guys did for us and he is just turned fifty and they only have any kids and he says well how you did it and for one thing they probably did a lot of sacrificing and and when you sacrifice you becomes you more horrible 

Recording: (9131/ 9621) 
no did you it is probably because you are it was in the paper in the summer when we were doing it and they did not want us  

Recording: (9132/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9133/ 9621) 
 got bears 

Recording: (9134/ 9621)

Recording: (9137/ 9621) 
but it is not 

Recording: (9138/ 9621) 
uh but the dispthe only reason they get thed is the suspension they do one of the ones going around locally 

Recording: (9139/ 9621) 
i think the ladder i do not think will make any difference the kids that i know in junior high and in in you know college uh it just does not make any difference to them and they do not like those classes they think they are boring they think it has no relevant to their life 

Recording: (9140/ 9621)

Recording: (9145/ 9621) 
yeah it is ridiculous i mean plus it is a national recognized school so a degree from a house state i mean you could go anywhere in the nation someone is at least going to recognize because the big the big big name actually it would be more of a sell i would be like okay we it is small it is private it is credited but so 

Recording: (9146/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9147/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (9148/ 9621)

Recording: (9178/ 9621) 
have you really have you kind of seen all of those shows and 

Recording: (9179/ 9621) 
and then we go do what we wanted to do 

Recording: (9180/ 9621) 
and you know i just really think they need to make that and uh an option for a young girl i really do because there is just you know there is just too many in one of children there just is and that really bothers me that we do not have another option like in other countries uh we are a lot more right wing here in america but i just feel that is got to be an option you know for these young girls it is just really done 

Recording: (9181/ 9621)

Recording: (9186/ 9621) 
and they leave and then you get either another ass or somebody good you just waiting till you get somebody good 

Recording: (9187/ 9621) 
that and the people that enjoy you think why are you why are we hiring these guys you know what are they what are they thinking  

Recording: (9188/ 9621) 
i blame it on that yeah because you know there is been a lot more kids that have died in school than you know just recently i guess it was not in the big numbers at one time but there is been random violence in schools you know where kids of his died even more than you know seven or whatever and i think that the media is just made into something that they have glamorousized it and some of the kids i think they are screwed up anyway and they are just like well hey you know i can do that and i will be on the yeah i do i think that is a big part of that because they will not their name known and they do not care if they die anyway umhum 

Recording: (9189/ 9621) 
actually they are they are working on it i am sorry to mention to them to you um they have if you are below the poverty level and you go back to work you get a certain like extra bonus beyond yes so there is a bonus for back to work you mentioned earlier about like how this would affect the children with the two year welfare thing i mean at least i know a lot more about the systems there for for whatever reason than i do about the system here which is kind of an fortunate but uh there i mean i do not really think in a lot of situations of course i am sure there are people who follow it as it should be and who who really need it and who really you know taking care of their children but unfortunately you do not really see that side very much you see that people who like their kids see none of that money you know they are left at home by themselves if if they can even you know get them to school if they even go to school if they are even bothered you know and you know those you know a lot of they are they are documentariesaries on all the time there so you really sort of it is more in your face than it is here that i ever noticed um but i do think and and with that they have specific programs for the children and um i think one of the problems too with the schools is the fact that you know if a if a kid has bad behavior or you know bad is not that you send them home i mean i think that is the most ridiculous thing like surely that is not a punishment for a lot of these kids and you know at least in england on these things i have seen you know they send them home and these kids are just doing whatever going around the neighborhood shoplifting you know uh hot wiring cars at the age of you know ten or something and i do not know i think i do have some of these strong opinions about people you know who are having all these kids and do not take care of them at all 

Recording: (9190/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9191/ 9621)

Recording: (9207/ 9621) 
as a result of the one trying to force myself back into what they do so i mean it is yeah i mean when they when you come down to these things there is uh people with mental illness and with disability disability are trying to panhandle responsibility onto everybody but themselves you know well the medical doctors if they would have seen this guy in given him medication he would not have went out there and killed somebody you know should have would have put him in if the guy stopped taking his medication of his own free will that was his responsibility to take the medicine every day just so i get is mine take mine every day and when i stopped taking mine that was my responsibility which is why i do not want to go to the legal system to try and make an excuse even though there is uh there is a some law that protects people that if they were drunk or on the influence of the medication or or off the influence of medication um in case they bought a house or signed into some kind of contract that they would not be liable 

Recording: (9208/ 9621)

yeah yeah good teachers do that i i i still get upset when i was teaching school i did activity base teaching um and i was doing some volunteer work at double in schools we were supposed to be one of the better schools in the area and i thought there would be all sorts of creative things going on and there was not it was still reading a chapter right the answers to the questions at the end of the book and i thought how boring i mean there are different ways to get kids turned on to things um i am not sure there is so much influence from the media uh and i say media broad base you would be it print media or tv um it has this culture today of um stars and you know media of uh a phenomenalous and and they do not see the relevant and i do not think they hear from their parents like i did the importance of voting and that is where it comes from their parents do not vote so if their parents do not vote they are not you know again i do not know what the the answer is um but it is very scary what is going to happen in the next couple of generations the only good thought for me is i think about this is an issue i think kids would get if there were kids in college that were being drafted and being sent to die in a war that people did not think was important or had no real relevant to their lives i mean i think the kids would food alley immediatelythe issue right now is that there is nothing there 

Recording: (9224/ 9621)

Recording: (9235/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9236/ 9621)

one of the bathrooms right now is that jacuzzi um that is not really too hard but the hardest thing to do is electrical work i guess just because it is more intimidating 

Recording: (9250/ 9621) 
or they made after that they had to lottering number and that was not up to your high you know if you got your number was picked i mean i do not know what is it would be worth knowing that you are going to get a notice of some reason to prepare it in order uh because if that friend is that got numbers and everything you know and getting a high number and sitting over the whole lot of my god so 

Recording: (9251/ 9621) 
right right but during the rest of the year a lot of times they will play really really uh challenging and interesting band music and you do not always get the opportunity to do that in in uh musical groups yeah sometimes they just sort of cater to the those common denominated what they expect the audience to want to hear  

Recording: (9252/ 9621) 
you know because i just think it looks so often when you can not you can not even admit to what you what your opinion is 

Recording: (9253/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (9254/ 9621) 
 columbus it seems to be  i mean it is just like whoa

Recording: (9260/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (9261/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (9262/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9263/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (9264/ 9621) 
the people coming from other cities like chicago new york you know and places like that where they were treated poorly by once you know they um they tended uh act differently towards you and everything until they realized that you were not like that you know uh we only had one racial once in it when i was in the service uh where it was we were predominately white uh platoon and uh because we worked in this was and stuff you know so uh then the security counts were uh us and they were predominately black you know and i do not know what happened so i am happened one time and there is on like twenty people in our the whole uh platoon and it was all in the same in there  and uh some guy said something off color to one of them or something like that you know and uh got kind of out of hand for a while but you know thank god nothing really happened 

Recording: (9265/ 9621) 
for fun we have been playing a lot of pool 

Recording: (9266/ 9621) 
yeah they do not pay it for any of that stuff  

Recording: (9267/ 9621) 
right wow 

Recording: (9268/ 9621) 
that was too young 

Recording: (9269/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (9270/ 9621) 
or that are having kids and i mean we talk about that is all we do is sit in there and talk about our kids and what they are doing and how our parents and then react and like there is this girl that just got in there today and and her parents really flipping out because she is pregnant and um we were telling them we were all telling her about how you know um it it is always starts out that way and they will eat she uh later on 

Recording: (9271/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (9272/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (9273/ 9621) 
i know 

Recording: (9274/ 9621) 
at that time in the uh thirties 

Recording: (9275/ 9621) 
do you want this do not only this this and that some people some people say that i feel sorry for those people i pray for those people because persum as a wonderful thing you can have going to get you through nothing else i do not care what challenge you have in front of you you put it in his hands and you know enough faith to practice it they will come through it may come through this way you think it is you want it to but somewhere on the line you are going to say uh for some reason i am i am supposed to do this i can not explain it but you are always looking for reasons you are asking me i do not look at the reason that but a lot of times you can not give a reason it just happens why did you married your husband why did you how did you meet your husband how did you come about how the passing of two explain it to your spring someday 

Recording: (9276/ 9621) 
they help him 

Recording: (9277/ 9621) 
those are i i think you were implying those are needs to those people but they are not uh they will how old we have correct some of this you have got to i think we have got to cut out a lot of this luxury we have got to slowly bring quote their family back home uh and i do not necessarily say it has to be the woman versus the man who cares in today is work uh we are we are far less agricultural far less related uh we are poor more in service or in service or in station and manufacturing or in station uh so uh a man uh uh or a woman in free to phrase a woman can do most of the work is being done outside of the home today versus what they could have done is agricultural people uh and once once again though that would bring people back to this central family make up just has to be communications communications as it is going uh it is it is a little reverse uh i i think it can be redistreed in much in the manner of your speaking uh and and where does this start i think it has start back here in first grade i think parents must participate with teachers uh as we used to uh with this common you could walk in and sit down and uh watch the students or participate with participate and or assist uh well today they have these assistants but they are hired directed assistants they are not in their poor train or passing their own their values of the community to the students uh so i think that is i i guess i come i will continue to come back to family to family almost everything has got to be come back to family bring that family back together and get them to communicate on that personal basis not that impersonal basis 

Recording: (9278/ 9621) 
because they are they are they are saying you are still a kid but yet 

Recording: (9279/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (9280/ 9621) 
but maybe if it if it would have stayed small maybe maybe i could notice some kind of difference that way but but i i never i have not noticed anything 

Recording: (9281/ 9621)

Recording: (9298/ 9621)

she there is our wonder left right there she travels all the time 

Recording: (9304/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (9305/ 9621) 
i do it so i think that would probably be about the biggest difference is just really the amount of education you get 

Recording: (9306/ 9621) 
you can not especially with kids just to overwhelming 

Recording: (9307/ 9621) 
really why this guy is close to japan 

Recording: (9308/ 9621) 
it was more comfortable here than in high school the big click see like the big click like the popular aburb crumby wearing people or like all the art students hanging out together it is a big mix of people and everyone is doing their own thing 

Recording: (9309/ 9621) 
you know i am very much in favor of gun control very strong gun control uhright and it they just seem to be too available uh of then some of the things that schools are doing about it you know the kid that comes to school with a paper gun gets suspended that a little much but 

Recording: (9310/ 9621) 
i think that is great you know i think obviously there is always a down side and but i think that too many people abuse the system and you know unfortunately it is very hard when you know then it ruins it for the people who really do need it and but you know as long as they have you know created a system whereby you know it will not be obviously as good for those people as it has been the ones who are genuinely unemployed but you know i think depending on how um sort of focused they are on the individuals in their area or whatever however it divided up i do not know hopefully not special treatment but obviously you would try to tear them more in whichever direction they are most seeded for you know as far as far as maybe like the volunteer work because i mean you know there is so much volunteering to be done everywhere and even if you do not have you know if you are lacking in whatever way you would think that you can you know there is something you know hopefully that i do not know 

Recording: (9311/ 9621)

i do not even i know they add so many beachies i mean in i know they add a good reputation you know for for like just just you know just having a great vacation time because nobody ever skied my from those areas oh yeah places terrible you know whether it was bad you know that that people are people are rude everybody is up there it is just going oh you get it kind of get it go you know it is on long fly but it is well what the time 

Recording: (9340/ 9621) 
where 

Recording: (9341/ 9621) 
acumcumbils or whatever you know and uh you know he is pretty much pissed off the rest of the way up there because uh i was right 

Recording: (9342/ 9621) 
my answer to you your question is how is this eroded i am going to answer with the we are using the word respect uh yes i feel that uh this has eroded over time uh there is not the respect for our elders i do not necessarily mean elders in terms of the uh chronald age but i am talking in terms of generations uh uh there is less respect for the father less respect for the mother less respect for the grandparents and the right grandparents uh not only give you a first hand example uh i just had a uh conversation with one of my granda daughter is who is now twenty uh she will come over to my house grandma is house and she will come in and she will flop down in a chair uh and she will do nothing in that household even if you suggest it uh i do not ever tell her uh to to do things and i have pointed it out too that whenever we went to visit grandma or greatgrandfather uh if the if we sold weeds out in the garden we went out and we hope to garden if we if it was chicken house need to be cleaned uh and they had not gotten to it that day we went out and cleaned chicken house and we would say grand paul they said okay if we go out and clean your checking out well of course you knew very well it was gonna be okay but a matter of respect though you ask god is it okay for us to do it and uh now with her uh i can have dishes out there in the sink uh that are developed there for from breakfast and maybe lunch and uh she she will walk out there i do not say well grab a whole company of dishes are not done and then she turns around and walks away a a that is right uhhuh and and she may then go ahead and she was on sometimes she will ask me sometimes and she does but let us assume she did she asked is it all right if i have some of these she goes ahead and gets the dishes out and she puts them right down that sink uh with those other dishes makes it a way for us to clean them and and i i i have seen this in many many many incum but i am going to be going to this is very first hand i know this and i strongly suspect that this is a typical typical thing in our society today so yes in my opinion definitely it is eroding i know you are talking a little different approach in answering a question uh from over the time that that this kind of thing is eroding in the base upon the word respectyeahno you are not even paying for it in virginia you are right over here or you know the y in the line the year or the line of the line you are not over the line so i can not uh i have heard some they just you know can not do it in age they might stand at another age from the light on the day of the river they are going and i am going to be doing it on the boy of the way backoh oh ohah but i mean i never uh and i just well i do not want to give you any that but anyway it it might not only be they could not do a i would try very very hard and i got twelve one and i had a watch little one of yours every so me to know and then little girl i would wait and i would do college you know they can be able to drive you would be able to drive you would be on the bus but i do not think you would but you are not going to the road but you need to be driving you are going to catch it and the engine is starting getting downyeah umhumyes so i know my husband is talking to my husband is talking to the theater to take it this time and my wife is just going to the malls huh well i have i had the whole thing because that is about very few reasons that whole thing was getting did  i do not knowyou get into yeah uhhuhyeah but it also the parents at that the these days and there is too many overdoers and there is too many overdooroc right now i do not think before the two people that have worked by the them will be getting on the right or right that is that and the man is that and the people they uh it has lots of different death conditions each individual has uh mental picture of what the word penalty means based upon their own experiences and i i want to take just an you say penalty in a very general sort of way whatever your extreme is to the right or to the left let us come back to about the middle i am concerned that we are getting away from penalties completely and i feel it is absolutely essential that we have penalties we have for everyone for everyone really across the board uh we we are getting away from penalty we are getting away from penalty uh uh so many people i would just to give you an example uh to talk about the i just read a a statistic the other day right here the because of the city of columbus where uh it was an extremely high percent i can not quote the percentages of people who uh ignore uh yellow lights and and of consequently they are in they have going through red lights and there are many many many accidents in there taking place uh all right and we it used to be that you could place uh uh on the law enforcement officer at the corner if it happened to him immediately would uh penalize you by getting your ticket in your face they of course as opposed may be well now we have passed so many little orders and laws and changed the enforcement policies and this kinds of thing where they poor police officer he can not even do that any longer he is got it is somebody it runs through red light you almost have to hit somebody and then be accused for going through the red light he can not just are butarily beat it because that is cold oh i think we are harassment pleased apart you are harassmenting an individual because you are standing there waiting for him to commit this problem without let us just get it away from that example you can talk about whether you you were carrying uh i do not want to get into the guns and knives and stuff in the school with enough 

Recording: (9343/ 9621) 
you know i think a lot of times you know people are not real rational as far as as who they they go for 

Recording: (9344/ 9621) 
it was okay to put up with my trying to learn how to be a parent in exchange for having me all through itself 

Recording: (9345/ 9621) 
not at all 

Recording: (9346/ 9621) 
their ideas and they mean the guys are trying to look older the girls are trying to look younger 

Recording: (9347/ 9621) 
i think because of the movies and i think of the nintendo and all those games that they have on there i think that really does spark things in little children is minds and even you know like in junior high than oh yeah we could do that you know and there is just so much violence in when we were growing up there was not any violence on tv we were allowed to watch it but you know i mean i mean the comics for it violent uh now which is too open for kids the parents you know they say the parents should monitor it down 

Recording: (9348/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (9349/ 9621) 
and uh from downstairs we broke into my computer 

Recording: (9350/ 9621) 
they do not i am not sure really what they do 

Recording: (9351/ 9621) 
i do not know 

Recording: (9352/ 9621) 
yeah my kids were supposed to two weeks late so i know how that is  

Recording: (9353/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (9354/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (9355/ 9621) 
it is kind of a neat place is not it 

Recording: (9356/ 9621) 
i guess so i hope that they can keep the schools somehow for kids and but it will not be him running it  

Recording: (9357/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9358/ 9621) 
umhum yeah 

Recording: (9359/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9360/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9361/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (9362/ 9621) 
somebody must have been watching over me 

Recording: (9363/ 9621) 
any books do you like 

Recording: (9364/ 9621) 
exactly 

Recording: (9365/ 9621) 
there is a lot of uh i do not know how how the training is done with some of these animals you know some of them are treated very cruelly 

Recording: (9366/ 9621) 
i have not seen any fights i have not seen anyone get shot i mean when you read about it in the land but the only thing that i was really shocked about was the people begging on high street 

Recording: (9367/ 9621) 
no uh just the usual things and she touched my things  yeah because they were far aparted about they had their own social groups they had their own friends you know so that in interests so it there was not much of that but they are not the usual you know she is breathing on me in the car he is something too loud  i do not know if you have got brothers and sisters but yeah you have i have you have throw it on yeah uh there were five of us and a a lot of that 

Recording: (9368/ 9621) 
but you know i mean one he was about nine years old but he is known me all my life so you know and i mean it was not a big shock 

Recording: (9369/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (9370/ 9621) 
that they fired him like that the night before the michigan game see then the next day he came down on the field with a black suit and a fadorour of you know a hat he looks so cool you know because he will put turn he always wears a tie i do not know he just he he is a great coat 

Recording: (9371/ 9621) 
yeah um and this is something i have thought about a lot because if i had stayed in cincinnati say where it is very uh conservative you know not real open to new things or if i had stayed on the east coast where of course it would be really competitive i i probably would not be working at the free answer today i came to columbus there was not you know there was not much going on when i came here 

Recording: (9372/ 9621) 
oh really 

Recording: (9373/ 9621) 
yeah it it is she does not even drive to work you know 

Recording: (9374/ 9621) 
we are stopped at one of their defensive lines 

Recording: (9375/ 9621) 
but then you do not have that people running the machinery and checking the machinery 

Recording: (9376/ 9621) 
you know we will go places you know 

Recording: (9377/ 9621) 
oh not that old yet i might look at 

Recording: (9378/ 9621) 
they do not have babies 

Recording: (9379/ 9621) 
yeah yeah yeah i it surpriseses neat to hear to find that that columbus is in so out of shape um but i am in the uh well you know in the circle that i move in uh everybody is for middle age and they all quit smoking and they all of the sudden trying to beat off the beep and um so you know i mean well and of course they were always hippies and it spouts and twigs and leaves anyway you know so that you know that is the sort of circle i move in but i know because i take have these part time jobs from time to time i see a whole different group of people and i could say it is probably true 

Recording: (9380/ 9621) 
humum 

Recording: (9381/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (9382/ 9621) 
just 

Recording: (9383/ 9621) 
so once you can then to people there is nothing to be scared of here and there is nothing to be scared of there nothing to and then they start to play and once you start playing you start learning 

Recording: (9384/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9385/ 9621) 
and and much and much other things you know that i am coming to understand 

Recording: (9386/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (9387/ 9621) 
we did not know you know anything about what he did or we found out more um after he died 

Recording: (9388/ 9621) 
yeah and 

Recording: (9389/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (9390/ 9621) 
yeah yeah that is another thing i hear about that 

Recording: (9391/ 9621) 
you know they never asked for extra money and uh they had to cut back on everything and they i think it just set people back now we are trying real hard to catch up and at some point we are going to uh you know have to put levy on again and and uh who knows what is happened we are keeping rose of smith right now because she is so good pr with uh with the business community but the business community in columbus does not really support the schools and they do not i mean we have got two new uh stadiums and we have not got any increase in school funny 

Recording: (9392/ 9621) 
yeah but my oldest she is the oldest uh she is got three kids one her oldest is by a different guy and her new husband adopted her because they she never sees them uh and then they got two other girls and they live together they go to the house you know their own they are going through marriage they have been together for like five years and they are not going they are not doing very well right now but hopefully you know they will get over that and then i got a older brother who um am in his girlfriend moved in together and they just had a baby 

Recording: (9393/ 9621) 
so they i have always used insurance but i had no doctor at the time and he went and met me they were going to make me wait two months before they did anything and what i did i had my wife drive to i would be down to the hospital and i crawled out in the car and crawled in the hospital until the other met me or i crawled out the door 

Recording: (9394/ 9621) 
yeah and it is been five years this year that we have been married and uh close to seven that i have known him so and it is still just exciting it still just is good and he am he am am amazinges me every day because i am i am one of these will not last forever but you know  and he goes like well we are ninety you know you will know  so 

Recording: (9395/ 9621) 
so uh he finally decided uh you know after oh well i went him to catholic school they kept his kept his desk in the hallway you know 

Recording: (9396/ 9621) 
why i mean it is part of the script that you say you believe and a hundred percent then why do not you why do not you talk about it and the problem is that they do not they do not know the answer and if they do not know the answer if they can not give a firm this is the answer then they avoid it um i try and find i try and find for me what has become the best answer you know if i do not if i do not if i do not believe something or i do not know what to believe about something i will go and i will find an answer for myself i am not going to take somebody else is answer and if i do take someone else is answer they better be able to back it up you know yeah yeah yeah yeahyeah yeah i know a lot of people who do but i know a lot of people that do not umhum umhum umhum umhumum did not see a logical discussion no no unless unless you are seeking that out i mean i go to the vineyard church it is up in it is up in uh uh west ofville and there is about there is about probably six thousand of us it is one of the biggest churches in ohio and uh if you want to find something in that church you can find it you can find a discussion group about anything it is just a matter of finding it and within any within any denominationation or within any religion you go as deep as you want to go you know there are people who just go on sunday mornings there are people who just go on sunday mornings there are people just going east or there are people who go monday wednesday tuesday and then sunday nights and saturday nights and are very very very into that and i mean i am not the monday tuesday once day thursday type but i am pretty involved i am pretty involvedumhum the community the community um the church is designed as a community of other christians it is not necessarily designed as um i heard this in a term and this is really good um it is not designed as a congress station comes in and says way to go past this you go do it we are going to cheer you on the job of a christian is to go out and spread the gospel of jesus christ that is the job of a christian and there are a lot of churches who have totally forgotten that that is what their original you know that is what that is what christian supposed to do and that is what our church does 

Recording: (9397/ 9621) 
wow 

Recording: (9398/ 9621) 
and that is actually a really interesting thing too because especially coming back you know and moving on my stuff out of storage i have just been on this you know i am getting rid of half of everything i own because over there it is you know it just feels so weird to come back and i feel so loaded down especially when i have spent so much time just living out of the suitcase you know i just really realize i have so much stuff that i do not need because there you know everyone has just sort of like a little closet with clothes you know there is not stuff all around everything is not more expensive so everyone has a lot less and here it is like everything is so relatively inexpensive that it is like you know picture frame or something there it might be you know twenty five dollars for one so you buy one here oh you know they are five dollars a piece let us buy five you know 

Recording: (9399/ 9621) 
and that is what i am saying it toning for thin quite a bureaucracy when you get a church telling you that you need to ask for forgiveous one what they did i mean in the church in things over i went and buried my grandparents and went to all my life over the door the church was a picture of christian or climas with a missionary apreast and all his men with his sore drawn a dead native american in his feet and three more at the side looking on in fair now i ask the priest whole hard question 

Recording: (9400/ 9621) 
i get weak but it is not  

Recording: (9401/ 9621) 
so uh they had some family responsibilities we were always i brother and i and my sisters were active in the four h club as 

Recording: (9402/ 9621) 
huh 

Recording: (9403/ 9621) 
oh that is that is a lot of stuff to do down there if you like outdoors  i bet 

Recording: (9404/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (9405/ 9621) 
the university never has money that is like me when i first came here the university was not paying me nothing i worked two years or two jobs for ten years while i was here at the first ten years just to make a living 

Recording: (9406/ 9621) 
and he did that too uh 

Recording: (9407/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (9408/ 9621) 
simply because it is not too much of a change from the status quo 

Recording: (9409/ 9621) 
um and like even the people the maybe their apartments did not look at them front of but they were making money 

Recording: (9410/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (9411/ 9621) 
thing you know collecting but it is hard well it is my sister is cats because she has a little girl and now she does not go home back every very day you know but um 

Recording: (9412/ 9621) 
in the light 

Recording: (9413/ 9621) 
yeah and i think it could work but i do not think people are ready to accept it and if the people feel it to give the information are not ready to accept it then 

Recording: (9414/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (9415/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (9416/ 9621) 
well you are in a high tech society most people you said you are from new york right your family is where 

Recording: (9417/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (9418/ 9621) 
i mean i 

Recording: (9419/ 9621) 
i think so 

Recording: (9420/ 9621) 
well they only keep them there like for you know a day or so and then they uh try to intervene with their family put them back with their family or uh maybe calling children services and i and i just really do not think you want your children is services so 

Recording: (9421/ 9621) 
 yeah i do not know where they are going now but

my thesis is on the sedate in germans those are the germans who lived in czechoslovak uh uh before the second world war and uh specifically i am looking at how they perceive their conditioning from being part of the astro hungarian upour uh and the germans being sort of the the majority uh even though they were not the majority but sort of the the uh the master nation within the astrohongarian ump to becoming uh a minority within czechahosia 

Recording: (9429/ 9621)

my mom teaches there so it is free tuition i get a tuition waver 

Recording: (9438/ 9621) 
you know that is a possibility you do not you you are not supposed to carry that much money around and it is as much to protect the people after you as it is to protect you on because you know the the word has to get out that we do not have that much money  it does not pay yeah 

Recording: (9439/ 9621) 
you know always something going on 

Recording: (9440/ 9621) 
personally i think it is too late because they can get things on the internet uh you know there is just so many things so many avenues for them to find violence and for not a few things that we you know when i was growing up we just there was no way i could see any of that stuff i had good parents but i i was into you know lousy and tom and jerry i mean you know these but you know they were not violent and they made you feel good after you watched them but i just think i do not think it can turn back right now i do not know 

Recording: (9441/ 9621) 
no the life style was you know very easy to sit into and i have always been you know interested in you know sort of like to the whole european culture um before i went there but i think the most difficult was actually because i was studying english when i went there and you know studying english here is as i am at other than and studying english in america and england is you know sort of i do not know more sort of elitist which i did not realize before i got there so i was in all these courses i was the only american the classes were really small and it was you know you i definitely got a feeling and it there were a few classes that really stood out where you know there was sort of you know you i would have to say something or i would have to give a presentation or something and it was sort of like oh you know what what this this american now and you know it was that was the hardest thing is the way i was treated by some of my uh peers and classes i mean not directly they would never say anything terrible to you or anything but it was just sort of you know that feeling of 

Recording: (9442/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (9443/ 9621) 
so they get more brian brian pounds together okay 

Recording: (9444/ 9621)

he does and he is love he he his music is extremely good he talked himself he by you know sixteen he is playing eight instruments very well uh he just and he can not do that now where he lives now he lives with this another thing that bothers my mind his uh girlfriend is mother she he is afraid of a girlfriend this girlfriend that her daughter was to run away so she let us them sleep together in their house when she her daughter was fourteen 

Recording: (9450/ 9621) 
he was one just for one minute my mother taught me that um i do not stay i do not stand them in the corner 

Recording: (9451/ 9621) 
it is huge 

Recording: (9452/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (9453/ 9621) 
but i want them to do that to me and i think if you could teach your kids that and get back to teaching the same thing on those radio programs and tv programs instead of what they are showing right now i think the world would be a lot of place the lot better place and along with the politicians they stopped saying now what is really best for the general public is that what we think to make ourselves look great 

Recording: (9454/ 9621) 
there is lots of of uh theater and the third thing would be we got restaurants  

Recording: (9455/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9456/ 9621) 
well i can tell you some community bands that could use you  yeah 

Recording: (9457/ 9621) 
i am retired 

Recording: (9458/ 9621) 
yeah i mean it is like it is known but it is in a different way it is like a different type of fame than like traditional style so it is like more of like our respect is opposed to like an adveration type thing like like it is more of like uh it is not like an mtv type thing you know 

Recording: (9459/ 9621) 
and he was the assistant manager of a video game store i worked at an high school 

Recording: (9460/ 9621) 
she is he is wonderful but even at the back of the back they were they was just sixties and they were hippies and you know my mom is got long and yet black hair in their we had their army outstates and they are whatever you know we have got bell bottoms and we got it long here down to here and everything so they lived like seventy fifth avenue for a while and we lived um like i said on some it until i was about three years old and then they split up for a little bit and got back together and my mom and i lived some place on campus in just a little one room apartment and it was just she and i and i would go see my dad on the weekends which was which was which great for me i mean everybody my dad and i would do fun stuff my mom would do fun stuff and it and and i do not i never remember them being negative 

Recording: (9461/ 9621) 
um and i definitely i mean i have i think i went to like kindergarten in a public school so i do not really know too much about like the kind of curriculums and things that they had to do but i know i mean as far as going to a lot of the stuff like in math and things like that that i am doing now is stuff already covered in high school so already have a basis for it 

Recording: (9462/ 9621) 
yeah that is what it seems i mean i i know it is like i mean it is the same proportion i mean there are more old people there but it just seems more apparent just because of how you can not like go outside all the time yeah i mean there is never like three or four months where you just want to sit in your house and 

Recording: (9463/ 9621) 
you know it is like look you always think i could you know look i am doing really well look how wonderful everything is 

Recording: (9464/ 9621) 
i think the news media have typed it up too much really i mean we have an accord with cuba that says anyone that is trying to escape from cuba united states has found it see is immediately returned to cuba whether you agree with it or not that is the accord and that is what that is what castro is uh that is the premise is operating on uh you know in the news media they have not really been up it they just have not been real objective about it i mean uh you know like they are two  people in that sea you never hear about the one because uh this was on one just briefly i heard on the news because he thinks he should get back to his father but you do not hear about him there is three cousins two of them think he should stay the my amy the other one thinks he should get back with this father you do not hear about him is reading about him newsweek or some place uh so i think the news media is not being totally objective about this 

Recording: (9465/ 9621) 
um you know it is stuff like that it is like it is kind of neat because you do not have to pay well you have to pay for it but like magazines 

Recording: (9466/ 9621) 
but we still need to have property management records that is very essential you know a lot of times when you are talking to engineers they do not realize that part of it uh they do not like the detail at least that aspect of it uh but we need to have a lot of that because you need to know how uh your uh facilities are structured uh the time history any type of uh activity on that whether it is been uh installed or removed relocated where my be but we need to know that how the head impact upon the design of a particular uh facility voice and data 

Recording: (9467/ 9621) 
yeah i mean like it just it provides an a window of opportunity for those who really do work like 

Recording: (9468/ 9621) 
three years i have them usually have them sixth seventh and eighth for those language art subjects unless they get some iraq less cure and they get phased out like right now i am phasing the kid in the eighth grader out and into the regular english but he worked really really hard and he is very bright and he still a terrible spell but he is not lazy and he does his assignments and as long as you clearly explain to him what he is supposed to do and he is a good writer and usually when he misspelled something you can figure out what it says from the context you know so we are in the process of phasing him out so that he will not have to he is had health i think since he was in kindergarten that is the other thing that is really in the stigma about these kids ninety percent of the time they are i use like a hundred and fifteen to a hundred and thirty and i mean they are very bright but yet something is not 

Recording: (9469/ 9621) 
i know the way we you know the way we dressed and everything you know it was kind of appalling to to the parents and everything i guess maybe this were i am coming from them and uh the way some of the uh case dress you know retro back too and with the bell bottoms and everything to us and the uh the piercing i just can not get into that you know and then some of the girls i mean know then some of the girls i mean they you know i mean my god they that fourteen to sixteen years older they look like they are twenty some years old you know and that is what they want to look like plus you watch some of these stupid shows on tv you know you set there and go my daughter do not do that you know which is around me now which is away from me i do not know what the house she does 

Recording: (9470/ 9621) 
he was only fifty six 

Recording: (9471/ 9621)

because i am becoming back to the point to the right if i have like any time away from my girlfriend 

Recording: (9473/ 9621) 
there is uh you know just uh i had three spiritual leaders tell me that a great gift came with that that there was it was no accident it was supposed to happen and uh there is a word called sink of curiosity 

Recording: (9474/ 9621) 
well in especially in my situation you know uh i would think about it quite a bit you know that i would have had a more of an opportunity to have a oneonone relationship with her i would probably uh uh being a girl you know could have probably help her out and uh i do not know a social social things social things you know about and because i i kind of get the impression that she you know really she is doing it very interested in men you know so which is the third thing you know so 

Recording: (9475/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (9476/ 9621) 
just you know let people make their own mistakes and then but do not make me pay for it you know 

Recording: (9477/ 9621) 
 like like what is the that is the bad time but if you had time and money and you would be able to you know do the do the taurus things 

Recording: (9478/ 9621) 
oh yeah i was never going to get married again i had my house with my kids you know had already done that i was financially secure and i did not i was not even looking one of my best friends though at the time uh she saw this guy she he was the roommate of a guy she was seeing and i talked to this girl everyday and she said oh you have to meet him you have to be i was like oh you know coming tomorrow i do dont want to meet anybody so it took a long time for us to be introduced but then as soon as we were he was right i mean and we were likeika from probably a two weeks after we met we just i have have not been without him so

yeah he is got energy yeah 

Recording: (9481/ 9621) 
exactly right yeah yeah and you know a lot of people i work with do not see that and you know they think i am a real cheapskate you know because you know i well i spend money you know and well i i am very selective i mean like uh i love to go to disney there are people at work that would not go to disney world just because of what it costs to get in you know now i drive there i do not fly because i am really that cheap but you know i would love to fly but i just go oh my gosh you know but you know i will do that but you know like uh like at uh thanksgiving time we do not buy butter balter and we buy amire and it is like it is just as good you know and you know we make do you know

yeah well we did not we did not find out we had a um i do not know we figured they would just wait and be surprised is that what you guys did 

Recording: (9485/ 9621) 
i think so i mean there is enough open minded people in the country 

Recording: (9486/ 9621)

i just have it in georgia right yeah before then i was fine if i still if i i made a mistake by planning for that one job i just wanted to get something different because i did not want to go back where i was so i would have been better off back where i was i would have been better at the job for one thing and i knew knew kind of insanity i would be dealing with there 

Recording: (9495/ 9621) 
that is fine 

Recording: (9496/ 9621) 
i do not get on it but i mean it is there 

Recording: (9497/ 9621)

umhum 

Recording: (9505/ 9621) 
which they have to 

Recording: (9506/ 9621)

Recording: (9507/ 9621) 
i tried calling them up picking them up picking them upgo pick these kids up because i thought they are doing something to help but you know you know and helping them 

Recording: (9508/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9509/ 9621) 
a one of i just go back and copy cat something she said uh picking up at picking up that child and cutting it and and having having that baby touch your skin uh and uh uh teaching uh what love is uh it you do not necessarily teach love by words but it is just by the feel that child will begin to love you as the father or the mother or the brother the little brother and the little sister all of those and you say teach that well my god did not they know that when they first came into this classroom no not today not today i i would rather say that uh the vast majority and i mean above fifty well above fifty percent when i say that i am not being a areokay probably have not had their mother or their father truly hold them and hug them rather than just saying hi johnny bye 

Recording: (9510/ 9621) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (9511/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (9512/ 9621) 
you are talking to people all over the country and i mean you are becoming more diversified because you get thoughts and opinions from people from all across the world and 

Recording: (9513/ 9621) 
the lawyers the judges everybody that works in that system okay who they are there is not an honest one in it okay there is not an honest one they might think they are but once you expose yourself the corruption  you take down with you 

Recording: (9514/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (9515/ 9621) 
so i just what that terrible thing that happened in montana 

Recording: (9516/ 9621) 
yeah they certain two that and three 

Recording: (9517/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (9518/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (9519/ 9621) 
i mean i i i mean that probably can be proven i do not know if anybody would do any decent studies on it i would just vacuum a million dollars that you know it would it is it is a it is the tv you know the and then and another thing that well tv is in uh where it comes from but like the kids are all into put them on right now 

Recording: (9520/ 9621) 
uh yeah i have because everybody pretty much around where we used to live just you know it gets worse and worse 

Recording: (9521/ 9621) 
yeah go in there and find out you know as a kid being abused if the kids being abused you know take them out you know forget the parents right you know or um yeah you know if they are using drugs put them somewhere you know and get them you know get them in rehab you know and keep them there you know just do not throw them there for three days and then throw them out to the lot of money being wasted on these kids being placed in these foster homes where nothing is getting accomplished 

Recording: (9522/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (9523/ 9621) 
does not father me at all 

Recording: (9524/ 9621) 
sure  um doing this is for myself i need something to sell and selling my own time does not actually seem to be worth while in the summer i have done it i have already done independent consulting uh we are in i saw the contract and said hi your pay me i will do this and i go do that thing and you make a lot of money like that problem is you get taxed up seemly like that because you are having a employer paying you up your taxes for you and um there is other bunches of overhead involved and there is the constant flow of marketing on self and it all depends on how much you want to market yourself marketing yourself easier for some people than for others and it is more fun for some people than for others so so far i do not know if i 

Recording: (9525/ 9621) 
that whole thing 

Recording: (9526/ 9621) 
yeah i guess they do i do not know what right where where it is or how many they have 

Recording: (9527/ 9621) 
i mean it is too late i do i 

Recording: (9528/ 9621) 
and color toammy one she is little 

Recording: (9529/ 9621) 
back there black so it is right near like a lot of those student housing 

Recording: (9530/ 9621) 
no they always have a way to get you out of the car and you know it is like the order of pizza for some place that is dark and they will be waiting there for you yeah yeah so that is yeah 

Recording: (9531/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (9532/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (9533/ 9621) 
oh no i do not feel that at all they you know we do not hesitate our to get together with other friends and take our kids places i do not remember my dad doing that stuff you know two or three dads get together and take six kids to the park or you know i do not remember things like that and they could have been there maybe but 

Recording: (9534/ 9621) 
right that is good 

Recording: (9535/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (9536/ 9621) 
i am gonna let him choose i really am i think as long i mean i really do not care what religion he is i mean with my husband i really did not care if he turned catholic or not i do think religion is important and whatever that religion is to him and he has a place to go to pray to be with his family and other people i think that is important if he wants to be catholic great if he does not that is okay too 

Recording: (9537/ 9621) 
but i mean that is just sort of the curious nature of the kids i mean they obviously they are going to get into stuff and things like that and i mean it is not always the parents fault i mean i there are a lot of people i mean i just in the news a few weeks ago they had a shooting cabin a couple of years ago and they just came diverted on it and the parent like left it in the top drawer of a toold that was locked in the can where the key was he climbed up on the ladder unlocked and he ended up shooting himself with it i mean as far as that because i mean there is really nothing more he can do i mean 

Recording: (9538/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (9539/ 9621) 
oh projects that right from fancy were i was designing the projects first of all we had to find out what we had with the best sure and uh as everybody should know even as a residential user you have to know what you have in your house the talking company does not provide it service to you anymore um well we had no we had throughout the save a mile in some eighty eight counties and uh wherever else the of facilities we had and so we went on a sca dohunt 

Recording: (9540/ 9621) 
the way i could discipline at the home 

Recording: (9541/ 9621) 
umhum 

Recording: (9542/ 9621) 
right well that is something i have noticed in the local news particularly lately they say up to uh an uploosively on our channel and stuff and it is usually not that big of a deal what they are talking about uh but they are making a big point that you heard this year first and i mean if you hear it five minutes over here on one station then what differences it makes 

Recording: (9543/ 9621) 
um but yeah i do not know i think yeah i think it is like there is like a real like either it is it is old people are there retiring or or whatever and or it is more of like a younger people there i know you do not see a lot i do not know there is middle age people there but it is not so apparent like this year i guess 

Recording: (9544/ 9621) 
um and i mean it was a pretty good place i mean looking back on it i remembered a lot better than when i was actually there 

Recording: (9545/ 9621) 
yeah but fifty years ago if you had apple up see they would lock you in the closet and throw it to key we would let you out most of the parents i have seen uh to me i would rather see the kids of the stepparent 

Recording: (9546/ 9621) 
i worked for a company called highlights for children 

Recording: (9547/ 9621) 
and it is 

Recording: (9548/ 9621) 
yeah no oh oh man i 

Recording: (9549/ 9621) 
um the one uh 

Recording: (9550/ 9621) 
 

Recording: (9551/ 9621) 
they were supposed to do it one time and then she was supposed to give him one day and they were giving him three dishes 

Recording: (9552/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9553/ 9621) 
right right 

Recording: (9554/ 9621) 
yeah my aunts do 

Recording: (9555/ 9621) 
have no idea  

Recording: (9556/ 9621) 
right well 

Recording: (9557/ 9621) 
right and and you are not as close to your family and the traditions and uh and i think you lose all of that and then you get so wrapped up in work and moving that i do not think kids have the center based of the family that they used to have and i do not know the the culture is just so fast paced that i do not think people are maybe it is not honesty maybe it is just they do not have as much time to get attacked and they are ready to move on again you just do not get as close to people as you used go 

Recording: (9558/ 9621) 
and you know people do not have big families like they used to you know so 

Recording: (9559/ 9621) 
help them yeah 

Recording: (9560/ 9621) 
that is just ridiculous too though but yeah to me that is really weird i do not like i said i do not know what they are what they are thinking it or what their thought process was but i am thinking maybe it is just social because a lot to me our high school is real social 

Recording: (9561/ 9621) 
well that gets back to what you are saying almost in the family life hey what is the you do not need a husband no he needs a burn bank that is what you are saying are not you are not you 

Recording: (9562/ 9621) 
well uh that i do not know it how to explain that especially if anybody is going to listen to this uh i had a friend that talk classes human potential classes it is very interested and i am participated very in depth in the human potential movement so uh uh a gentleman by the name of all him is under everett uh who really is the father of their human potential movement moved out there and he was going to have a group of people work out there and uh and he said that you know i was qualified well when we got out there just fell through you know we all just lived our lives but i was glad that you know that he got me out there because i adored it i i just loved it out there 

Recording: (9563/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9564/ 9621) 
i think  

Recording: (9565/ 9621) 
in the case of tie it should be used but you know like if there is a black woman who is very well qualified for a job and my male is equally qualified for the job the black woman should get it 

Recording: (9566/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9567/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9568/ 9621) 
and and the data they collect is just i mean by i mean there are some of those long forms that go into a lot of detail but the basic data essentially how many people live in the household one of their ages in race and that is it and that is not a i do not think that is a big secret myself but
