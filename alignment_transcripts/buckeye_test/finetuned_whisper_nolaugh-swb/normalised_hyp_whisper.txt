Recording: (19/ 2140) 
but i want them to do that to me i think if you could teach your kids that and get back to teaching them the same thing on those radio programs and tv programs instead of what they are showing right now yeah i think the world would be a lot of place a lot better place and along with the politicians they stopped saying now what is really best for the general public and that what we think to make our ourselves look great 

Recording: (20/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (21/ 2140)

Recording: (24/ 2140) 
which i think george w is trying to do um uh whenever anybody tells me that i go tell him i tell him yes and i am an uh an different and liberal 

Recording: (25/ 2140) 
i have just the same opinion i think most people have us as tv 

Recording: (26/ 2140)

Recording: (27/ 2140) 
you should be real attentive to what is happening in his school situation his or her

um 

Recording: (29/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (30/ 2140) 
what you did 

Recording: (31/ 2140) 
i mean well that guy who could change for them that and in the movie they were about to kiss and i i do not like it when they get that close i i like the oh their their relationship is still professional and they interact with each other on that level first and they are very good friends and they have that attention but they do not to it and i really like it i just dislike it a little less 

Recording: (32/ 2140)

i would like to be you know but she lives i keep telling her we she would move down here but i am not moving to toledo i do not like toledo yeah 

Recording: (34/ 2140) 
um i do not i mean there definitely is that image of you know dallas and dallas to you i think it is it is worse i think for the the image of the tourists like basically they think anyone who can afford to be over there must be absolutely loaded you know and that was sort of another thing when you know i went to school there is you know i had a scholarship that is how i went there you know and i worked 

Recording: (35/ 2140)

Recording: (37/ 2140) 
really 

Recording: (38/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (39/ 2140) 
uh yeah well um i think the teachers are every bit as good as but i think there seems to be uh the whole administration up through the board and just it it is not as gist you know i do not know how it is great it is like the teachers are so sort of it seems like they almost have the feeling they are on their own what 

Recording: (40/ 2140) 
so and it was it was neat though because pete was my mom was twenty nine and pete was eighteen and so pete was just like some kids who liked to play you know we would go and buy kites and and do all that is fun stuff and 

Recording: (41/ 2140) 
so 

Recording: (42/ 2140)

Recording: (46/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (47/ 2140) 
i mean i i had parents that everything i did was negative i mean they just told me i could not do this could not do that and and so what i try to do is when anything comes up i was thinking of how my parents would handle it and i do a hundred and eighty degrees so you know because you know they just i do not know how i got i sort of feel i am mentally okay now but i do not know how i got here because i have been the um-hum 

Recording: (48/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (49/ 2140) 
it was uh part of the time 

Recording: (50/ 2140) 
but people coming from other cities like chicago new york and you know and places like that where they were treated poorly by whites you know they um they tended to act differently towards you and everything until they realized that you were not liked at it you know uh we only had one racial incident when i was in the service uh where it was we were predominantly white uh platoon and uh because we worked in missiles and stuff you know so 

Recording: (51/ 2140) 
you know my daughter you know there is just a lot of stuff when she was in high school and i would call up to the school and you know the principal would like you you say you know i am i am her last chance you know my daughter was going to summer school every summer and he is like mrs you know she is like you know the average student uh uh 

Recording: (52/ 2140)

Recording: (57/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (58/ 2140) 
what is good now uh well the way i began has changed that there is computers have made a big difference uh it is more exciting now for people who are in the that area uh who are interested in it is more emphasis on information than not books and things going to the library it is getting the 

Recording: (59/ 2140) 
and so you know even though it turns out to be the real traditional breakdown it is not it is not because i have to it is not because he you know he would not do something that that something else it is just suits me fine

Recording: (66/ 2140) 
then see our paper so when you write on the white copy it comes to onto the yellow copy and at the end of the period the student just rips off the back copy and hands it to his friend so he he did not have to write you know if he was not getting the notes

um the parenting staff they gave us a video to watch at home which was things like how to die for your baby um a thing about whether you should leave them crying hang in there in their bass and that are crab which of course i think is horrible and they think it is good that they have come out with all these new studies and tell people do not do that um let us see what i feating your baby i mean the just 

Recording: (79/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (80/ 2140)

oh 

Recording: (83/ 2140) 
come to offer me that or or tell i mean she is the first i never even heard of it and uh there is another there is all kinds of programs that you know like there is this warrant that um where like say i i live with my mom my mom can be getting paid from the government for me to be living there you know because she kind of helps me out you know and i do not know what that was called i mean i am just now out finding this stuff out you know 

Recording: (84/ 2140) 
and not that that changed my opinion of her uh but back then and nobody would talk about it and you know i just think in today is world we need to bring the subjects like that out no one because there is so many people who are shrew about things and they should not be a shame because it is a lifestyle anymore you know i just it needs to be brought up more 

Recording: (85/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (86/ 2140) 
mother he used to be a principal of mine in elementary school so uh he is like i i think we should talk i was like okay great kids always like oh boy you are way too serious okay that is what we knew ahead of time those all were coming in androar so i i um at this point in the store i should point out the paper that i went downstairs for i do not know where that is i never found it never saw it never it it is anyway not real even in all of the story but it bugs me every time i know of a story because it does not exist anyway 

Recording: (87/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (88/ 2140) 
lived in the dorms my freshman year and then i moved into a house with a bunch of guys i met yeah so what was different um one of the the things i really enjoyed that was different as the traffic and that really no that really that really became really became uh interesting and different for me when i started working for a career s service winter quarter i took off i took all classes off winter quarter and worked for a career service because i needed some money and i loved driving and let me tell you it is really really different 

Recording: (89/ 2140) 
and there is some people that deserve to be fired and there is no way that you can reallyifferent you just because they are in a union they 

Recording: (90/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (91/ 2140) 
there i do not there was nothing there that really i can remember that did anything good for me i mean i think middle school taught me a lot more or than high school 

Recording: (92/ 2140) 
for the the slick image bothers me uh he has the potential of of trampling gore i think that gore will be the the normanee no matter what bradley does gore has it sewn up because he is the insiders um at 

Recording: (93/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (94/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (95/ 2140) 
right that is right yeah so that that was an interesting and when we went to church up hamilton and over to uh and on more so up new albany road to morrison over to high street none of that commercial stuff was out there on more road i do not know if you know more road very well but there is uh out out by carl there is shopping center after shopping center after shopping center after housing development after but when we did 

Recording: (96/ 2140) 
to the other side 

Recording: (97/ 2140) 
terrible murderers get away with murder now by that plea bargain that plea bargain i think is the most thing that ever was passed i do not think they there should be any plea bargains and then the well but there are people who would get murdered uh instead of electric chair electric chair i still believe in it because if someone is and i do not believe that they should have ten years of uh what do they call that legal process where they can putting appeals thank you that is it 

Recording: (98/ 2140) 
yeah because i mean five years went by like 

Recording: (99/ 2140) 
so 

Recording: (100/ 2140) 
oh that was the monica lewis 

Recording: (101/ 2140) 
multatoryers the way i was raised um are you planning on staying home after you uh 

Recording: (102/ 2140) 
honey is cloth is challenging and organic chemistry is very challenging but 

Recording: (103/ 2140) 
she has trouble driving even at night and stuff like that 

Recording: (104/ 2140) 
before i found out actually so so we could stop we could stop the story here we can go out because the story it is a fun story but 

Recording: (105/ 2140) 
and i did a lot of music interviewing and writing there and then i moved up to editor and it was sort of through that job that i got my first job with phony wow i was as a as a sort of ohio representative so i was concentrated in ohio state and then you know basically it is just some i am not doing this as a there is just sort of something i am doing in the meantime until i decide whether i am going back to school or 

Recording: (106/ 2140) 
she is granted she uh she is expanded her horizon if you will and 

Recording: (107/ 2140) 
i do not have any evidence to uh to support it i just know that i have a i feel that i have a distinct uh uh a very clear distinction between what is uh in what is fiction what is true and what is imaginary and uh so for me i do not think that television has affected me in that way um i mean one way that like television has affected me is i am full of media references 

Recording: (108/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (109/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (110/ 2140) 
green bay packers 

Recording: (111/ 2140)

Recording: (113/ 2140) 
um 

Recording: (114/ 2140)

Recording: (118/ 2140) 
you know 

Recording: (119/ 2140) 
and then when it became cold enough in september october maybe even as far as november this year would have been november we would take those shoes out and depending upon who is put in those shoes those would be the person it would not be the the one who had worn them in the spring because he is growing and in the meantime and uh and it may go to another another and i can remember we pay our shoes down as many as four we children now my dad also repaired shoes 

Recording: (120/ 2140) 
oh 

Recording: (121/ 2140) 
hm 

Recording: (122/ 2140) 
well you have to uh try some different things like put on head phones with music that does not have any words and try to read somewhere like 

Recording: (123/ 2140) 
um yeah that is what they suggest doing is two years of med school get your phd and then do your last two years of med school 

Recording: (124/ 2140) 
oh there always has been there always has been i think a lot of people feel that kids a lot of kids are on medication today that should not be but um i think that is the fault of the school or the parents or some doctor that like for example when we refer kids and for a doctor we have a list of three doctors that we work with and we know that they will not just give this kid a pill if he does not have eight out of the twelve symptoms or 

Recording: (125/ 2140) 
i am sure i am sure it is you know it is just the circles i move in 

Recording: (126/ 2140) 
i see 

Recording: (127/ 2140) 
ten years no question about it that is it you are in jail for ten years eighteen years old if you have got anything on ten years that is it you know and you look at some of these other people like sports people and 

Recording: (128/ 2140) 
oh they just uh 

Recording: (129/ 2140) 
four four years ago i do not know it is been a while four and a half years ago something like that 

Recording: (130/ 2140) 
yeah i am a democrat i have never voted for a republican in my life even when i lived in oregon and i always the dored mark half filled i did not vote for him though i think that was the worst thing because i thought he was a great republican and well but i think personally my coleman was good i i have met uh well 

Recording: (131/ 2140) 
needs for that budget they bought things on a cash basis as they needed it they did not go out and spend on credit i mean i am trying to have myself here but business said hey let us produce these lines little later you are a refrigerator we can make it for you and we can make it cheap for you because we can mass produce it 

Recording: (132/ 2140) 
uh 

Recording: (133/ 2140) 
i mean i did not have the greatest chance to talk to my kid the way so these people were talked to her eight maybe six or something like that and she wanted to sit here at mommy so she made her sit with her which is cool and mommy just goes to sleep and little kids trying to study her home or you know 

Recording: (134/ 2140) 
discipline i would be screamed at made get jumped on the floor to do push ups i mean it was it was 

Recording: (135/ 2140) 
um 

Recording: (136/ 2140) 
his mother died um the week after we got married she had diabetes um uh juvenile without diabetes her dynasty age eleven and just over the years uh um ended up having open heart surgery and and make it through the surgery my grandmother also died during open heart surgery so my perception of open heart surgery even though i am a nurse it is not very good just because of the two 

Recording: (137/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (138/ 2140) 
deep space nine in that uh they address the issue of different people living and working to yeah different people with different i mean these were aliens rather than different ethnic denomination of humans but it it approached that from a less um uh from a more realistic standpoint instead of having like an old star trek you know everyone gets along then we come 

Recording: (139/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (140/ 2140) 
my son now i saw him one let us see it was fifteen maybe he would run across the street when martha the eighty six year old lady across the street was trying to and bring her garbage down he would seen me do that i go oh let me get that for you marza she is got arthritis she looks like she is going to fall she takes steps about this big and and i have seen him do that 

Recording: (141/ 2140) 
then you are really going to get out of it what you need to 

Recording: (142/ 2140) 
the door to um buy his home suit my sophomore year and he was a cashier there 

Recording: (143/ 2140) 
in adequate but that was even through nursing school i mean those were not things that were discussed you get a special conference is to get information on that 

Recording: (144/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (145/ 2140) 
uh-huh yeah 

Recording: (146/ 2140) 
uh 

Recording: (147/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (148/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (149/ 2140) 
yeah i like that 

Recording: (150/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (151/ 2140) 
yeah but i have got more influence i think maybe i am not sure i am hoping i have got more influence over him than his father does 

Recording: (152/ 2140) 
yeah i mean i want to see how the season ends out it is just a lot of the ones this season to me have just been disappointing the the i mean i think every show sort of has a peek some shows peek towards the end some at the beginning and sort of level off the the simpsons had a stretch from like their third year to like their seventh where things were just like unbelievable funny and then they had some writing changes i think and this this season is just 

Recording: (153/ 2140) 
and we started talking again and it was just like we had missed any time and started dating 

Recording: (154/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (155/ 2140) 
whereas i do not know lutheran is a little bit more open to 

Recording: (156/ 2140) 
so we have really never had a lot of use for the union but recently we just figured out that you know if they decide to strike we have no choice to and you can not work because they will take all the money you make crossing that line so you can out work anybody that came back to work will lose all the money that they made they will take them to court and they will be it is against yeah it is against the union contract so you had this 

Recording: (157/ 2140) 
yeah i 

Recording: (158/ 2140) 
i think that i do not think the divorce is a bad thing i think that it it is if you are married and you we will that you get to a point where you and this other person are are not in a positive relationship for each other where for anybody else in your family that it is better to just say this is not working we both deserve to be happy and we and and and go your own separate ways um i 

Recording: (159/ 2140) 
it kind of yeah well i have seen worse so um so and they are doing this i think it is called sitting reach where he is got to sit on the floor and he is got to raise his feet up just so and and he is got to take his hands and reach towards his toes and they do that for you know like five minutes first time and they increase it and he really hates it 

Recording: (160/ 2140) 
but then that hurts the the the administrators in the sense that they are there to provide an education so it would be rough and like my high school they they put up cameras and they had like they locked bathrooms like at certain times you could not go in them and it was getting and they had like we were on the front page the american journal because they had a lock down where no one was allowed to leave their classroom and then they brought this the dogs through and they found i 

Recording: (161/ 2140) 
you can not you can not be mad at somebody for choosing a lifestyle you just can not life is too short you know i mean you can love them either way it does not make any difference 

Recording: (162/ 2140) 
that is why it is mainly appealing to people you they pay you to go to school 

Recording: (163/ 2140) 
i forget they have like way more than like they dwarf any other state i think so that to me is not that is not bearable and then i i so that that is one reason i would not vote for boy um 

Recording: (164/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (165/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (166/ 2140) 
um i am signed up for architecture right now which i like architecture but i think there is probably more time into it than i am ready to actually commit into it 

Recording: (167/ 2140) 
yeah harvard uh 

Recording: (168/ 2140) 
you do not have too many options you know 

Recording: (169/ 2140) 
this 

Recording: (170/ 2140) 
um-hum

Recording: (192/ 2140) 
not really national system it is already been put to national if they rate them state to state and city to city but on on the level of the actual needs of the student you know you can not just put down you know a book and say i want you to put five hundred words on this page while you like this or dislike this book i mean one person can do it and another one i mean 

Recording: (193/ 2140) 
gets was recognized he was nothing 

Recording: (194/ 2140) 
well in the lower grades i believe that they are because i think they should have some male role models 

Recording: (195/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (196/ 2140) 
and whenever you have a heart attack anymore they always suspect coke is the first thing 

Recording: (197/ 2140) 
yeah yeah ever authority figures it all you know she is she is really strong about that though because um she does not look at anybody being uh you know maybe more wise or experienced in things but you know certainly she does not trust anybody 

Recording: (198/ 2140) 
do they have like these big lecture halls over there too 

Recording: (199/ 2140) 
i did have a a parttime job i loved it it was just four hours a day but they wanted me to go fulltime and i just did not feel like i wanted to go fulltime so i i was working as a receptionist and uh answering the phone doing some light filing just a variety of task office type task and i really liked it and liked the hours but i did not want to go eight hours compared to four so i left 

Recording: (200/ 2140) 
during the depression my grandfather um moved over here and then asked her 

Recording: (201/ 2140) 
but that is my plan 

Recording: (202/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (203/ 2140) 
that is a good way 

Recording: (204/ 2140) 
and uh and that i say we went to church fairly regularly but to tell you the truth i can not remember too much that i was talking to them but uh but i was exposed to it in any way and i i am sure that some of it rubbed off on me 

Recording: (205/ 2140) 
right no 

Recording: (206/ 2140) 
period and it is that is a long process i mean this has been going on for two hundred years this way uh and people are suspicious of government asking questions 

Recording: (207/ 2140) 
i think that influences how everybody becomes not only the kids the adults too 

Recording: (208/ 2140) 
they are all boys there so when i pick him up from there he is out of hand a little bit and i have got to get him back you know you are mom now you have got to be safe settle down 

Recording: (209/ 2140)

Recording: (213/ 2140) 
um

Recording: (219/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (220/ 2140) 
kind 

Recording: (221/ 2140) 
well the daughters already taking golf lessons 

Recording: (222/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (223/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (224/ 2140) 
yeah so i get a lot of you know what from my sisters 

Recording: (225/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (226/ 2140) 
you know you know argentina wire and by wire and all those like a big big uh brick wall and whatever you could actually you know still see it unless they tore it down okay just like to pursue the history of it okay right yeah so you actually it is like it was like because you were like a part of that history at least when you were over there 

Recording: (227/ 2140) 
we are going to do and if boy if they say that and they really make it so and ask them two or three times on tape that they understand this before they sign this even well then how could they say they they have got to come up with new rules and they got to make the penalty stick 

Recording: (228/ 2140) 
well unfortunately i do not think it is fair but i think in the long run it does not have to be a college education because most of those people probably would not want a college education uh but like a trade or a skill or something that will give them a little bit of hope if they do want to choose to get a job instead of probably in a bank or selling drugs or whatever they did they have that choice it is it is it is up in their head okay i can either go become a welder or 

Recording: (229/ 2140) 
in the business world in other words i used to work uh during uh high school days for a furniture company and those days it was ninety days cash and we would sell to people and there is a and there is a well gee we just and talk to men that oh they they do not have the they do not have the money that is financed at the bank well why are we selling it to them though well we will get our money back and the bank bank it do not mind we will get we will repossess it and we sold the same darn thing over three or four times 

Recording: (230/ 2140) 
he is finding things for his family things you know what i found one of them way back and what was it sixteen seventy or something this boat load of people come over from england and they were the ones that had been deported from england because they had done something against the government or something like you know stolen or were the thief or something and i said would you be the only person i could find in my family is nothing but but uh convict yeah you even got deported from the country i do not know why he was you know that that is a ship he was on 

Recording: (231/ 2140) 
to me that was very strange 

Recording: (232/ 2140) 
no no um my i was born in new york i was in plano um i then went through tennessee with my family and right it was six months 

Recording: (233/ 2140) 
i you know from my perspective which is skewed of course to me i think it just seems that way i mean it was we are only talking about ten cases that is not very many you know i mean you could by coincidence have them all be african american um if i were african american i think i would have a different perspective and i you know i do not do not live in a neighborhood where we see a lot of police so uh you know i just do not i am i am not in touch with it 

Recording: (234/ 2140) 
um sector and i think that is a good sign but i think there is a huge there is millions of children that do not have any health care and that is not right there is like there is a a lot of like between the lower in the upper there is a huge disparity but at least it is a step in the right direction we have a a nice solid middle income middle income in it middle income base i think because a lot of countries only have the like i visited mexico and seems like they only had the distinction between the opera and lower i mean their middle class is very small and that uh 

Recording: (235/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (236/ 2140) 
well 

Recording: (237/ 2140) 
yeah well my little family all graduated megan was first in her class joe is rank first my brother phillips rink iowa was not he would have but they are all they are all straight four point 

Recording: (238/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (239/ 2140) 
um well actually it is sort of all happening in a certain area you know with you know very high unemployment like council council states um you know just sort of stereotype you know kind of bad family environment you know parents have loads of boyfriends and girlfriends drugs everything else and you know a lot of these girls that have been interviewed they had three 

Recording: (240/ 2140) 
i am like oh english people your accents so neat and all that kind of thing and then when i went there you know i and this was actually one of my friends but i remember you know she was german and she was sort of asking me how you say different words and things and then she sort of looked at me and she thought like oh actually i should not be asking you i do not want to learn the american way to say those like i want to learn the and people would say things all the time and it was you know they would ask you what your background was and if you would say well i am american they said well you know like where your 

Recording: (241/ 2140) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (242/ 2140) 
as far as i was concerned for what they were doing um you know one one principal that from my uh daughter is high school he was out pretty and all the time they you know they he was he was right around in a corvette and uh he tried to take me out 

Recording: (243/ 2140) 
yeah exactly pass through it random jobs for 

Recording: (244/ 2140) 
they went they went to private schools they went to private schools i certainly did not want them to go to public schools and even when going to the high state um compared to miami university i saw i see a difference as in the standards of the of the students um but i believe and i have seen it with my son going out of state that his more uh he is gained through his uh pre college years are staying with him uh and i am very grateful that there is 

Recording: (245/ 2140) 
or to do anything extreme to their bodies 

Recording: (246/ 2140) 
and everything that uh they will tend to talk to maybe you are talking to somebody else then uh like in a tortage figure not believe it to them what they say 

Recording: (247/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (248/ 2140) 
fifty percent of everyone who married has divorced within a matter of about five years as i understand the statistics today and uh uh unfortunately it is still increasing but there is a strong feeling that maybe this going to slowly reverse or at least decrease not reverse probably uh once again we are talking about communications too and the communications can be ill and they can be great uh as she is touched 

Recording: (249/ 2140) 
a crystal clarity and they will just run with it and that is what my mom came out of um her her denomination this year that she came out of it is not part of it anymore the nomination she came out of it um some of the more devout churches within the apollo christian we are talking men sit on one side women sit on the other women wear little thingies on their heads no jewelry the german is read in three different languages yeah 

Recording: (250/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (251/ 2140) 
uh-huh well you you had a good reason to be bothered 

Recording: (252/ 2140) 
because then you know what if something major happens then it is the fourth time then what but i think at least for children especially because they have no means to to help them and like the parents obviously even if they are working a lot of times can not get health care for their children so i think at least for children because how many accidents happen to children like two years breaking arms and stuff 

Recording: (253/ 2140) 
saying that they wanted to save this nice white girl because i had so much potential and uh they were not going to let me throw my life away like this well it was you know it was bizarre and so i was always from that time on i decided these these people are all crazy i am never going to i am never going to be like that and so i have a whole lot of different values from my family and it is real hard for them because all my other siblings who are younger are willing to 

Recording: (254/ 2140) 
yeah yeah i think so yeah 

Recording: (255/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (256/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (257/ 2140) 
probably 

Recording: (258/ 2140) 
i never learned math we had in our fifth grade we had the principal realized that nobody knew their times tables you know big pizza party plans uh 

Recording: (259/ 2140) 
it is a lot of money 

Recording: (260/ 2140) 
yeah probably because we have some public systems most of them are for the librarian but there is some for public too 

Recording: (261/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (262/ 2140) 
just 

Recording: (263/ 2140) 
oh i would say family values custom is traditions um divorce moving just looking at my sister like my sister i mean she is very happily married but my god i mean they they lived here in columbus he is from they met here they moved to indianapolis they moved back here they moved up north they moved back now they are in london england they 

Recording: (264/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (265/ 2140) 
you know so unfortunately you know i guess i never thought of it a lot more pressures put on schools and education now 

Recording: (266/ 2140) 
well 

Recording: (267/ 2140) 
his last name 

Recording: (268/ 2140) 
yeah and and it just it is moving there the whole you know the strip malls and i was in i spent my first christmas there and bell just a friend and i mean we would drive behind you like oh this is because of you know your country these people are moving in and buying whatever and so conversionally i see it moving in the other direction unfortunately rather than 

Recording: (269/ 2140) 
i mean i i mean that probably can be proven i do not know if anybody would do any decent studies on it i would just bet you a million dollars a you know it was it was it is a tv you know the and then and another thing that well tv is in uh where it comes from but like kids are all into poke them on right now 

Recording: (270/ 2140) 
less fortunate out there and that there is little things we can do 

Recording: (271/ 2140) 
and my sister was here like i said and then moved out and just come came back a couple months ago um my grandfather just passed away but he was here and then her husband home for about a year 

Recording: (272/ 2140) 
it is like if we if america you know we are we are used to being raised one way if we went to another country it is just kind of like you might want to get to know the chinese people but you might not quite be a little timid about you know seeing kind of thing but i i am not i do not have any of those barriers 

Recording: (273/ 2140) 
yeah uh i i think that he is he is right to my generation what more uh oh i do not do not want to say spiritual but more morally uh well directed and 

Recording: (274/ 2140) 
um probably would have been about six years ago i ran in sixth or seventh grade 

Recording: (275/ 2140) 
usually clinton bell my mom she um she does not she is not a big fan of driving she does not really drive very much which is good i have ridden in a car with her one time and and because she just would prefer not to and we that is okay with us because she she is got a driver is license for ida those types of things but for the most part so she kind of stays like the clintonville area yeah 

Recording: (276/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (277/ 2140) 
money is not everything it is too bad sports have ended up this way 

Recording: (278/ 2140) 
because heck you know it is it is it is sitting here i mean i it is it is that is like a that is like a tourist place 

Recording: (279/ 2140) 
i do think there is some and i do not think they probably get exposed to like the different walks of life i do not think they will probably be exposed to you know the gay lesbian i i think that would probably just be blown over and they did not go very much in depth you know about sex and your sex classes were pretty but on the other for me that was fine i do not know our friends that have a eleven year old that is going to public school i mean he had a parenting class already where he had to carry 

Recording: (280/ 2140) 
yeah i have heard that too different it is different and it you know i keep trying to figure out now was it worse when they were this age or is this worst you know and i then you can talk to some other people that are oh you have not seen anything yet wait till they just do not even want to be in sight with you and do not wait till they and i am not going on vacation with you 

Recording: (281/ 2140) 
and then you just have to treat children like they are just just you have to respect them and you have to not not talk down to them and and that whole thing about you know why can not i do this well because i told you so 

Recording: (282/ 2140) 
they are dare 

Recording: (283/ 2140) 
humum 

Recording: (284/ 2140) 
at each other is through for this that and the other and and you know devonism my daughter is one i really get put in the middle of it you know and probably i could have been more uh problems legal problems you know as far as uh going back and forth to court putting her on a witness stand for stupid stuff you know so uh you know i decided it was kind of a blessing that they moved there 

Recording: (285/ 2140) 
they are normal people and i have got some really cool people who are who are homosexuals and that we where that was going is um we went to access which is uh one of the home it is one of the gay um uh dance clubs in columbus it is um it is on high street it is down in uh it is down no it is not 

Recording: (286/ 2140) 
first grade the first grade teacher was aware of what he needed but the principal would not let her give it to her to give him had to do what everything anybody else in the class was doing he was even tutoring some of the kids in first grade and it the last grading period she would give them just everyday she would give them a math paper to work on he said i showed you know and i i do this i am not doing it 

Recording: (287/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (288/ 2140) 
huh 

Recording: (289/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (290/ 2140) 
oh it is most of it is horribly liberal and they have always find some way to misrep present like uh kurdish 

Recording: (291/ 2140) 
oh here yeah they gave us ten thousand here is a dollar that is fun 

Recording: (292/ 2140) 
and there is like nothing in it and uh you know it is like go down the list that is what i do he just thinks i automatically know him a mind reader that is what it is

Recording: (301/ 2140) 
yeah i think i i just think that typically you see a lot of lot of places that are that are under construction and not very many people work either 

Recording: (302/ 2140) 
not usually fifty two car deck cards but other interesting types of cards 

Recording: (303/ 2140) 
i know well you get you get to take advantage of it for layoffs and stuff

right with the human rights 

Recording: (307/ 2140) 
that was all i knew 

Recording: (308/ 2140) 
but when you look at home and he things there was a point where they they asked a yes or no question 

Recording: (309/ 2140) 
that is they are doing different things like different people in the program but i kind of decided to take the easier 

Recording: (310/ 2140) 
three weeks and they go that is right so they take there is no excuses you know and it is it is very hard i know my youngest daughter who is just as smart as my oldest would do horrible there because you know basically they say uh we are talking about china this week and uh on december the fifteenth we want to report on why chinese people do what they do you know it is like in every week they do not come by and go have you started have you started have you started do you have the out line 

Recording: (311/ 2140)

Recording: (312/ 2140) 
go out and have fun person 

Recording: (313/ 2140) 
concern that we are getting away from penalties completely and i feel it is absolutely essential that we have penalties we yeah for everyone for everyone really across the board uh we we are getting away from panel who we are getting away from panels uh uh so many people i just to give an example uh talking about adults i just read uh a statistic 

Recording: (314/ 2140) 
yeah well if it does not if it does not work then i can well that is nice that is fine and he says i will get married and hell if it does not work i will just get divorced that is a great attitude to have him that i mean 

Recording: (315/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (316/ 2140) 
not quite there not really 

Recording: (317/ 2140)

Recording: (318/ 2140) 
yeah blue that that is right frank sinatra is the one who is saying no i will do it i did it my way and that is really i think the biggest problem in the world today i want to do it my way and you can not oh you have got to cooperate with the other person 

Recording: (319/ 2140) 
and it it is kind of weird because you when i went from middle school to high school it was like a big growing up period and i see them like what are you doing that for 

Recording: (320/ 2140) 
sounds a lot like our dog 

Recording: (321/ 2140) 
and the um that was part of the process there to how to work work and work up there too with people but if we could just share more 

Recording: (322/ 2140) 
um have those apollo and to have the the church set up like it was and it must have been really strong because it is still lasted all the same and catholic and or all the orthodontics church is still carried all these beliefs 

Recording: (323/ 2140) 
they are normal people just outside of their sexual well majority of the people prefer head or uh sexual 

Recording: (324/ 2140) 
um 

Recording: (325/ 2140) 
well this is about given opinions and my opinion about the columbus public school system really is not good 

Recording: (326/ 2140) 
um but there are if they do not let the animals sleep with you know that and with the cat and they crawl up with you it is hard to say no but you know i i do not think eventually well it is been probably a year 

Recording: (327/ 2140)

really and it is a fun job it really is i i have only ever known one male that taught first grade and i knew one guy that taught third most of the time if they go in elementary ed they go for the upper grades like four five or six but um i really think that if we let the always be more exposed to men earlier than they would be more motivated to learn because they would see that it is not just a girlie thing 

Recording: (329/ 2140) 
oh 

Recording: (330/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (331/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (332/ 2140) 
if it were possible i think that a lot of parents are trying to raise them what they think is the best right now and that is another problem it seems like the way the financial world world has come up and everything else the way the cost of living has increased it almost takes two parents in that home if you want to really live a halfway decent life and be able to do some of the extra things no one wants to live and only have to be able to just use like you said well i the necessities 

Recording: (333/ 2140) 
yeah and they they need it right 

Recording: (334/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (335/ 2140) 
you know he says that he equals nancy square and i say it is the equal nancy cubed because the world is three dimension it is not two dimension uh two imagine limits everything but you look at his stereo relatively all of our mathematical theor physicals on physics and things of that nature they have been based off that

Recording: (338/ 2140)

Recording: (339/ 2140) 
it is like being that with this adoption of the baby we know that that is best but dealing with the emotions of it this is uh it is great we are very family oriented and it is this is a grandchild we will never see 

Recording: (340/ 2140) 
and just totally bombarded and i mean here it is so forced but as well i mean i i came um just before halloween and you know i i walked into the grocery and i mean just like right there we are just like cakes cop cakes because you like everything just right in front of you with like all this halloween stuff on and i mean all the holidays in here are so pushed at you and it is such a money making you know and it is so over the top where there it is sort of like there is a little bit of that and there are decorations and 

Recording: (341/ 2140) 
if you just look at the nature of what they are doing it is just 

Recording: (342/ 2140) 
uh yeah well it was like i kind of just like stopped going to class and and like and i just like ended up with wrong because i would have like failed everything anyway so it um and i was living with my friend for a while um but and then like no i no me and her and my other friend live in don may and her 

Recording: (343/ 2140) 
and then they are going to say they want to nail their parents you know their parents are sitting at home they have no idea what that kid is doing 

Recording: (344/ 2140) 
right we are kind of like just because everybody else is doing it this way does not mean it is the right way and um yeah i you know i really really struggle with that because i come more from i think the families should teach it but let us be realistic how many families are going to do that or out of the mentality to do that it seems like um sounds like my dad these days these days most of the people a lot of people that are having kids yeah 

Recording: (345/ 2140) 
which was i do not see what those guns are of art with weird within ten ten yards was a hit was a talk and because if you had one of those things thirty seven pounds of t n t golf within ten yards of it 

Recording: (346/ 2140) 
i just renewed my certificate last year so i may get back into it part of the reason i renewed my certificate was i did some home instruction with the columbus public schools last year and that is kind of like a tutoring job where you can go you can range hours with a student that is at home for some reason uh i had one that just had a baby and uh they it is an interesting job because they look for somebody that can cover 

Recording: (347/ 2140) 
put plastic oh i do not know it seemed like it is a tough call because it is very unusual situation here at a high state where they have a union and they have so many different gills in a union you think of unions you think of auto workers you think of type fitters you think of you do not think of such a wide variety of 

Recording: (348/ 2140) 
the one that is eighteen now i thought he was going to be left handed up until he was like four because his dad is left handed my sister is left handed i have one left handed parent well when i was in one day he picked up the thing with the right hand and he is been wrote with his right hand ever since so you really can not tell because they they are pretty much either or until they are about five 

Recording: (349/ 2140) 
um-hum i mean columbus publics they they got some work to do too like the other night i was watching tv and uh and elementary school overdosed a kid and uh like some uh i think it was a drug to calm him down so he is not so hyper and they like overdosed stay him like twice in a day and then when he goes home his mom even overdos a name because he they are overdos a name 

Recording: (350/ 2140) 
i do not know i would like to think i would like to say no sitting here but you never know because i guess that is because that is what happens to a lot of them you know they they come out of school all i dealistic and then they go into industry and then they are molded and assuming they make upper management you there is you want the tax break you want the thing you know what i mean and then they like i have an uncle he is a vice president of wall street from maryland she said you know he he got out of school is very idealistic but now he 

Recording: (351/ 2140) 
sure you know you do something with them but this group the the middle thirties i called them you had them a zoge of them and that is what clinton did so well and that is what dole could have done i am not sure if george ww is going to be able to uh because to get the the nomination eventually he is going to come out and have to make his hard statements to those people which is i am anti abortion i and pro gun he is already said the pro gun and that is going against what most americans are saying dull i think represented were most americans 

Recording: (352/ 2140) 
oh yeah yeah 

Recording: (353/ 2140) 
quarter 

Recording: (354/ 2140) 
and i think some of my feelings about that sort of thing is uh is is colored by the fact that i collected data for twenty years from employers uh i am a lot more sympathetic to that sort of thing um yeah i just am a lot more sympathetic to people collecting data 

Recording: (355/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (356/ 2140) 
well um 

Recording: (357/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (358/ 2140) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (359/ 2140) 
so she so i probably did learn a little bit because i i she is still that she lives with the man now and he does all the cooking still so i have i have learned everything on my own upon cooking and stuff like that which i did love to cook 

Recording: (360/ 2140) 
well i know people that sleep outside and uh but not all of them are veterans and everything but they they are again they do not want to be a part of the quote unquote sheltered system you know uh staying in an open shoulder or going away or something like that 

Recording: (361/ 2140)

Recording: (363/ 2140) 
oh yeah it is so much better to have it in an alley or sit down on your deck and look in your house the neighbors right behind you you are staring at them sitting on their deck we got all woods and a creek and then in the gulf course uh so that is hard to find in the city limits because we are inside two seventies still so 

Recording: (364/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (365/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (366/ 2140) 
you always had 

Recording: (367/ 2140)

well the charge was cutting class yeah and what it was i was supposed to meet my mom outside i told my teacher i brought it guy is shoes slip and all that i went down to my locker before and the teacher we caught her as a general because she would always be out there watching you not a teacher but a minister excuse me and she was out there and she saw me in my locker and what are you doing down here in the whole thirty minute 

Recording: (369/ 2140) 
yeah i would be at least thirty maybe like getting up towards forty before i have the experience really necessary to get in a good job but i do not wanna be i mean like my uh venturing crew advisors is thirty eight and retired i mean i am i am going more for their 

Recording: (370/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (371/ 2140) 
a couple movies here and there but we see what they rent or you know take out compared to uh you know the cartoon network and all these it is just cartoons it just seems so worthless now days but actually you will watch some of the older cartoons that we watched and they seem more violent than some of the new ones you know daffy duck and the road runner and these times they all it was was killed the fox you know and so we are just like wow we we do not i do not know if we want to watch let them watch that either so yeah there 

Recording: (372/ 2140)

um i am sort of in upper clintonville um 

Recording: (375/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (376/ 2140) 
well i do not know if it is minneapolis county or 

Recording: (377/ 2140) 
and that is i think that is really a major problem and i think there is a lot of problem with young kids today do it my way or uh they all um hit them or 

Recording: (378/ 2140) 
as i was teasing 

Recording: (379/ 2140) 
i know 

Recording: (380/ 2140) 
heard that the more conservative unitary churches are in new england around boston where it was started and they are some that are relatively conservative there but um for the most part it is it is what you would call liberal religion yeah are you 

Recording: (381/ 2140) 
the room and she has a two year old child and now another little girl um i said eric you know it is it is nice to go in there and see that but i just have no 

Recording: (382/ 2140) 
because the priest they had there would not let him take community and all the other kids were taking community and and that is pretty much the priest decides that and he and he felt singled out when he was i mean he was the only one and he was uncomfortable with it uh but it has some kind of problem uh i am not a a just person myself but i am not against it and if i and maybe i have justified it to myself by saying well the teaching values 

Recording: (383/ 2140) 
it is a no it is a uh clinical study where we are seeing how treadmill training affects the stimulation and people with a lot of quite injury 

Recording: (384/ 2140) 
on the spur of the moment i would have to think about that i really would 

Recording: (385/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (386/ 2140) 
it is just like your people you see go to church or walk out to church to see somebody sitting there at homeless 

Recording: (387/ 2140) 
yeah and then uh one day my two sisters older than i we areness and princess and i were outside playing and pardon i do not know whether they were nice or me but one of them i said well now let us go down and weed in the lake 

Recording: (388/ 2140)

Recording: (389/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (390/ 2140) 
no 

Recording: (391/ 2140) 
and just started picking a fight with them 

Recording: (392/ 2140) 
in the 

Recording: (393/ 2140) 
i think it has changed drastically and i think it is changing and i think it will also be changing in the future uh going all the way back uh finances uh were were not a consideration in the in oh i would say probably my first thirty maybe forty years there was some there was yeah influence but i think the influence was not financial it was influence from the person who could get up here and talk with a group of people and sway them with 

Recording: (394/ 2140) 
is that right 

Recording: (395/ 2140) 
sure 

Recording: (396/ 2140) 
exactly 

Recording: (397/ 2140) 
yeah gotten to a situation where you really there is a no one situation from the get go and uh uh i think that had we been able to do uh we you went over there to do initially it would have worked out okay but we were not so so it became a political war or something like that 

Recording: (398/ 2140) 
got a ways to go it is getting better 

Recording: (399/ 2140) 
it is it is 

Recording: (400/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (401/ 2140) 
yeah that was after i got kicked out and i just decided how i will go to work work for a couple months make something out of it i learned to trade 

Recording: (402/ 2140) 
acceptable so 

Recording: (403/ 2140) 
well the uh worth family and uh the criminals have been around forever you know uh we are just in industries and and the worth family is almost as much uh uh the you got uh i think it is for his duty uh who is like it was a construction guy so uh uh they have been around forever and everything and uh they can get their ways through uh political arena and everything but i think most of the money was uh was private money but they were given like tax 

Recording: (404/ 2140) 
and my but now my daughter is my daughter has twin sons who just are a year out of college and uh i think that they are one of them particularly is i think in good moral good sort of guy and the other one i do not feel like i know as well but 

Recording: (405/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (406/ 2140) 
oh 

Recording: (407/ 2140) 
yeah there is a lot we need to do a lot of the volving we definitely do 

Recording: (408/ 2140) 
i think it was a a nice thing about what we had uh we had uh grandparents that were not necessarily they were out of state in some cases we did not see them that much we made a part that uh we communicate with the grandparents regularly and when we did it was a special time we um emphasize the fact that uh uh you know kids want to do certain things okay they saw their mother go out and maybe do some additional things to 

Recording: (409/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (410/ 2140) 
forced to take this class like i think that if i i mean it is good to be enforced to take a like a liberal arts thing because like you do not know what you want to do so it is like if like you hate math and you do not take a at all but then you decide you want to do something in the bathroom you are like screwed like can not go back 

Recording: (411/ 2140) 
like the continent 

Recording: (412/ 2140) 
oh really 

Recording: (413/ 2140) 
um well as far as my mom goes she is real into the catholic faith and i mean she made me always go to church and things like that 

Recording: (414/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (415/ 2140) 
but it and it is it is parents that fight for the society and within your community you know the parents for each individual child they have to all for them to yeah there is a group and almost be all parents to all these kids as a group you know it is not you can be the best parent in the world at home and then your kid goes to school and it accesses the computer or they get in a group of kids where their parents they do not even know where they are you know it is the kids responsibility to get and go to school you know maybe the mom and 

Recording: (416/ 2140) 
home we interact the school is great you have people that are on the clock who trying to quit they are gone those people do not know the meaning of life they will never know the meaning of life but if they stay around try to extend themselves a little more with somebody at home problems at work and are willing to work with that person i would say willing to work not knowing they are going to be compensated because they will be compensated 

Recording: (417/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (418/ 2140) 
you know like there are two fisherman that found him and see you never hear about the other one because that this was on one just briefly i heard on the news because he thinks he should go back to his father but you do not hear about him there is three cousins two of them think he should stay the the miami the other one thinks he should get back with his father you do not hear about him as reading about a newsweek or someplace uh so i think the news media is not been totally objective about this 

Recording: (419/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (420/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (421/ 2140) 
they are covered but it was real tricky because she sort of had some she was a us citizen she found a love through email over the internet back in the early like in nineteen ninety it was real early i went over there and married the guy uh and so she had some of the medical problems and she emigrated and uh it was just it took years to get that straightened up but she is covered now 

Recording: (422/ 2140) 
how many times you been in ireland 

Recording: (423/ 2140) 
if they had a way to cure it then fine but leave that up to the people 

Recording: (424/ 2140) 
that is how i feel that is that is what i believe i just believe 

Recording: (425/ 2140) 
well it is like that i 

Recording: (426/ 2140) 
just you just can not go on not that they are going to stop at totally 

Recording: (427/ 2140) 
going to be a really busy day and i would the same thing at poor columbus you know i i would see all these cars but it would be just about the same traffic and i am like and i imagine somebody go where are the extra and they go they can not add extra airplanes it is they have certain routes they can do they just have to put bigger airplanes on but they said you know you will see larger airplanes when it is all day time so they can put more people on so 

Recording: (428/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (429/ 2140) 
oh 

Recording: (430/ 2140) 
yeah excuse me to pay the rent and that is yeah 

Recording: (431/ 2140) 
there was snow or something 

Recording: (432/ 2140) 
yeah so she said she is going to be catching the disability bus out here you know after third round time she is going to ride that bus 

Recording: (433/ 2140) 
or more accurately i think she took it but yeah it is a fine line um and so she wears that around and i replaced it so i have my own again i wear those on around so we have competition to see who can get the most well traveled around you get two points of every country and you get one point for every state or violence within that country 

Recording: (434/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (435/ 2140) 
um-hum um-hum 

Recording: (436/ 2140) 
i i like to talk about columbus 

Recording: (437/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (438/ 2140) 
okay that is good 

Recording: (439/ 2140) 
what we should buy yeah the retail what we should buy and that is the problem we listen to business too much if business reemphasized their goals to help society out and not themselves 

Recording: (440/ 2140) 
and i think um of course we would all hope that abortion would not be that that nobody would have an abortion that would be the perfect world there is nobody would ever be in a situation where they would need one um but i also think you know i mean i mean yeah there should not be there should not um should not spend six weeks on abortion or six weeks on what to do if you are pregnant um but but i think the subject has to be mentioned just just in passing 

Recording: (441/ 2140) 
i think for the most part of people can handle it um obviously i think probably more the older generations would be the ones that have the bigger problem with it the ones that grew up like during the whole black rights movements and things like that um i could see them having a problem with it but i mean more white like more the generations of today or whatever like basically anyone not at the age of about forty or fifty or so i think that they could probably deal with it i mean i do not think it 

Recording: (442/ 2140) 
you know i mean i liked earl bruce and i uh waited on him a couple times at a restaurant i worked at he was a nice is man and when they did that i do not know if you know about that one they fired him the day the for the michigan game for having a nine to three season three years in a row they fired him the day before that game 

Recording: (443/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (444/ 2140) 
i do not know trial stuff i also would not mind doing um since i have a business degree i would not mind doing uh um some sort of financial laws stuff you know like being a a lawyer for somebody who wants to sue the crap out of another corporation oh plenty of money in that i do not want to be in the amulation i do not want to be an ambulance chase i just want to be i just want to be somebody to help screw all the big giants oh yeah yeah one giant will not be 

Recording: (445/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (446/ 2140) 
yeah we do have a mutual thing and young people they are you know there is so many different infatuations to start with that they get blinded and they get you know you know off course and everything else and and then it does not stay the same i mean it is all exciting and and all that and then you know i think it is kind of 

Recording: (447/ 2140) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (448/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (449/ 2140)

Recording: (453/ 2140) 
yeah it is my daughter yeah um-hum 

Recording: (454/ 2140) 
so and we had like to listen to a native speaker so you got really good really quick 

Recording: (455/ 2140)

um-hum 

Recording: (461/ 2140) 
and um so basically they decided to build a new building adjacent to the church tacked on and we they ask the choir for input 

Recording: (462/ 2140) 
um i i think it fills it is niche you know i mean i mean wexner has a niche and the and the museum has a and um i think it fills it very well

Recording: (467/ 2140) 
if uh you know you come from a situation like that that does not mean you have to be like that do you know what i mean kind of 

Recording: (468/ 2140) 
i think so i think so if you are willing you know anybody who is willing to put out the effort i mean you do have to you know you have to sell yourself there is you know you are not going to just sit around and wait to be discovered but uh if you put out the effort i really do not i do not think there is that kind of that kind of discrimination anymore 

Recording: (469/ 2140) 
yeah that and i think i i am a firm believer that uh little subtleies like that to yourself are much better than looking the mirror and going look at them whoops and you go well this way when you go i am getting a gut and you know it is like that is so negative to your would you tell your mom that you know 

Recording: (470/ 2140)

and that is what we did and so he is just like my own too now i go and volunteer he is in kindergarten i go and volunteer in his classroom too so it is kind of like i hope i get to do this forever 

Recording: (484/ 2140) 
and they do everything they possibly can to make me happy and it is like um my my oldest girl she we are expecting our first grandchild here within a couple weeks and and she and i see each other all the time my daughter who goes chose to live at home because she just said it was just a better situation for her and um it is not that these girls are not independent and can not do it on their they are megan could my second daughter could have lived on her own from the time she was twelve i mean she is just very very 

Recording: (485/ 2140) 
short uh essay for for a test and uh but the way that i would grade those would be pretty scientific i think you know it would come up with a rubbock and i would say you you need to have you need to mention certain things and i will give certain points for your mentioning certain things yeah i have i have never been a i have never been a teacher who is had to assign or grade creative writing i am not sure i would know how to do that yeah 

Recording: (486/ 2140) 
you know talk to her but uh people do not when i was fourteen i did not care what anybody told me i was gonna do it no matter what 

Recording: (487/ 2140) 
yeah i think i got really good um i would actually been thinking about it like what departments in the school were good and which ones were not um the foreign language is really they have a version classes from like at second level 

Recording: (488/ 2140) 
i will raise them the best way i can 

Recording: (489/ 2140) 
uh it counts if you are touching the ground or something that you are sitting on is touching 

Recording: (490/ 2140) 
um actually i was over there when all of that happened but of course it was all over the papers and you know i think i mean i i do not know what it was like really here i can imagine but i mean there especially they really focused on um not colin bine but the one with the the younger kids in arkansas was it do you before i was there for both of those but you know in the first one you know they they put the picture of the little kid in combat gear holding the gun everywhere 

Recording: (491/ 2140) 
let us watch seven and nine 

Recording: (492/ 2140) 
yeah it was real fun real fun i just greatly got him kicked out of the dorm he still does not know what was me but yeah he still does not know it was me but he and i are still on speaking terms which is fascinating um but uh you know i mean our first day i walked in he said hey i am tom you ever smoke pot before i was like no he said hey we got a whole year together and and i am directly quoting that is the first thing he said to me that is the first thing 

Recording: (493/ 2140) 
and uh the second tornado it was not as bad i mean it was we was driving up after he uh ripped me off and he said well i am taking your sorry out to columbus and i said okay go for it and just sitting there smiling all the way up knowing all the way he did not know we get the tennis see and i you know weather is kind of bad there too i am like hey man slow down you know you do not have any wind chill wafers in the middle of this rain storm 

Recording: (494/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (495/ 2140) 
i hope so yeah 

Recording: (496/ 2140) 
and so i think it gets driven home i think the media does that in a lot of places they pick something that is sensational and keep they are making it even more sensational like when uh uh john kennedy died 

Recording: (497/ 2140) 
it is really beautiful out there we like we like mountains and you know walking around uh we got married to lake tahoe which is really beautiful 

Recording: (498/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (499/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (500/ 2140) 
he is a picky eater which he is yeah he he does not like everything 

Recording: (501/ 2140) 
it is everything pretty i mean like basic stuff that you it would be a like you know like a laz earth or something like that you know or i i bunch of places you know like electronics appliances uh uh 

Recording: (502/ 2140) 
if they are any germans in there i will bet they are scared 

Recording: (503/ 2140) 
and i would just hear things 

Recording: (504/ 2140) 
um-hum me too 

Recording: (505/ 2140) 
um i am a luther and and a lot of what he says about everyone going to hell 

Recording: (506/ 2140) 
as back into into high school 

Recording: (507/ 2140) 
uh neither one of them is married or had any kids uh my sister does have a boyfriend for probably like three years or so and there is talk about him like marriage and kids and stuff like that with them 

Recording: (508/ 2140) 
well it is you know the crime you can not really stop and other things that happen just you know too much partying around and i mean that is why let us off half a new because i could not you know but you know just everybody all the neighbors being allowed and everything my mom is older so she can not really put up with any of that and 

Recording: (509/ 2140) 
like i am not i am not really sure like how they how the interview works to become a teacher um i do not know i think it is like a lot of times they are really desperate to find people and so they really just take whoever i mean they are lucky enough to even have a i need to fill the place and they are doing well enough i mean the kids are learning material i mean sort of i mean i i mean it is working well enough i guess 

Recording: (510/ 2140) 
north 

Recording: (511/ 2140) 
oh my that is goes with the disorder they know they know when who is button to push and when not to push a button and how far they can go and you know where the line is and they push you always that is why teachers they uh they drive the teacher up the wall 

Recording: (512/ 2140) 
i think society uh today uh today is less tolerant of uh a lot of things that they see where people getting by with stuff you know and they are more vocal well uh as opposed to being environment but back in the sixties and stuff you know uh not here but you know down south there are people still getting hung and stuff you know for being a black or something and uh you know there are bad blacks and there are bad whites too you know so 

Recording: (513/ 2140) 
wow 

Recording: (514/ 2140) 
i 

Recording: (515/ 2140) 
you know so you can use all those opportunities to show your kid what not to do 

Recording: (516/ 2140) 
well i mean to me the whole thing is wrong regardless of if you are guilty or innocent there to me there is worse things worse things i would think than than dying you know you you like i know when real the guy who killed vietnamese he got locked up and he is not allowed to see it because um under jewish law you can not kill 

Recording: (517/ 2140) 
and now it is our turn to deal with the issues we see our parents we see this generation all these things that are still popular so we do not look down on the sixty i mean i think the sixties sound like a pretty fun time to live i will get into politics in a second um but those things are popularized but no we can not do it anymore because we have got these sounds 

Recording: (518/ 2140) 
because they would not let him when i was there 

Recording: (519/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (520/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (521/ 2140) 
yeah i do not really have any childhood recollctions of california yeah

yeah he is teaching us uh system five just funny 

Recording: (523/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (524/ 2140) 
uh i i think i like that how it is kept with a sort of a tension and it is not like you know i i mean they are not completely thrown together like uh bonana and tom which i do not like that at all 

Recording: (525/ 2140) 
and he could not have any kind of caffeine otherwise he would get the shakes and he took all kinds of pills 

Recording: (526/ 2140) 
i am fifty two yeah 

Recording: (527/ 2140) 
oh exactly i am planning on just staying in the house if i can or whatnot yeah oh yeah yeah i know i mean we are going to get some water and whatnot because you do not know people might turn things off like you said 

Recording: (528/ 2140) 
microsoft i do not know i think lennon is will be around forever just because it is such a stable system it is so good and yeah and macintosh will stay around forever just because macintosh is invincible um-hum um-hum after the big hype on the imac and it did not do as good as nearly as because they thought it was going to do if 

Recording: (529/ 2140) 
um i do not know do you know anything about unix 

Recording: (530/ 2140) 
and um i mean i know i did not think that much about it no well i am not doing anything else why not um and um uh i mean i mean i do not i just seems kind of silly to legally have two levels i mean either either you are going to go do it the hard way or you are not 

Recording: (531/ 2140) 
wow 

Recording: (532/ 2140) 
the problem is lack of commitment the lack of commitment and not saying hey there is a niche for you you can not be a male oh yeah you want to do the operation i can not be the yeah he wanted well why not be happy what you are god made you what you are why not make you the complete person you are and not strife for something you can not be 

Recording: (533/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (534/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (535/ 2140) 
i went to ou for about three months but i was just got out of school you know and i 

Recording: (536/ 2140)

Recording: (541/ 2140) 
oh 

Recording: (542/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (543/ 2140) 
i think there might be but i think most of them are dying breed they are the older citizens um many in my generation uh they there is probably be because i am i am the early baby boom i am i am the first of the baby boom uh and that is when the woman is movement started and many men they are still have not always accepted that so there there might be a problem there but where the the the generations even the later baby boom generations behind me when i talk to them i talk to uh high school students or even young college students 

Recording: (544/ 2140) 
no no they did not um they did not pay for grading or preparing your classes or or searching anything so right but but still even though it was real a very much underpaid job i i liked it when i did it uh i liked the in today is class because i had to develop my own curriculum for it right they had a when they told me i i 

Recording: (545/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (546/ 2140) 
they will be getting a van yep um grew up in upper arlington not far yeah really those five miles makes a it is a different stuff like because i yeah because i live on campus 

Recording: (547/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (548/ 2140) 
well it is not that there is been too much growth i mean growth is good but now they need to stop 

Recording: (549/ 2140) 
well it is not it is not how it is put into effect the law it is how it is enforced now you will just say well you know little johnny stuck is finger in the pie and you can not do that anymore and you know the more the more security you are going to have over that pie the more he is going to want it so and and going into the gun thing it is pretty much nobody is winning game i mean you make stricter laws 

Recording: (550/ 2140) 
and so you had to 

Recording: (551/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (552/ 2140) 
the direction is being put or they are being pushed 

Recording: (553/ 2140) 
um they just got different beliefs she believes all i mean like one thing she believes all men will cheat 

Recording: (554/ 2140) 
yeah much too fast for me you know my 

Recording: (555/ 2140) 
but it is not going to work i mean they if you are around people i mean number one they are around their parents and their siblings and that is socialization you go to church or to the library or wherever i mean you are around people and you are around children and they get to have socialization if you want to call it whatever and i think from everything that i have read and seen yeah well 

Recording: (556/ 2140) 
is apartment 

Recording: (557/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (558/ 2140) 
where from 

Recording: (559/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (560/ 2140) 
just carrying around a gun and shooting someone 

Recording: (561/ 2140) 
he has he has not questioned me like that but i see a lot of things coming out he is doing more in my he is been doing things a lot more differently than my daughter because my daughter was away at school and he he is with us every day so he is home and every kid does not wanna stay on campus and uh it is he does things voluntarily we do not have to coach hum he is working with a lot of other people i mean they what he is been reared with coached with and so forth it is somebody in bed it he sees that 

Recording: (562/ 2140) 
well i think a little bit safer idea than uh eliminating guns because you know there is always going to be weapons out there instead of eliminating the problem you know more centralized it make it a national law that you have to be a certain age get a certain time period for your background checks and whatever else kind of record finding they need make sure your 

Recording: (563/ 2140) 
um the commodore sixty four is they have heard of it but they really do not know what a brilliant system it was that it is and it is initial stage and it just got bulled over because you know something better came out something better will come out in windows microsoft will eventually go under she is just going to take a while oh yeah oh yeah i do not i give it probably about six or seven years before for before somebody comes out with a system that is just as good as 

Recording: (564/ 2140) 
and just to shows the ignorance and so many people you know and so that really still bothers me and there is there is still still so much of that going on you know so 

Recording: (565/ 2140) 
hum 

Recording: (566/ 2140) 
the factory there is uh not really there is all sorts of there is all sorts of of of um industry in the man isville area but there is a lot of it no actually most of it most of it stayed most of it stayed it is been it is been there for a while yeah we have got the man isville state reformatory where shoshank redemption was where shoshank redemption was recorded yeah yeah 

Recording: (567/ 2140) 
no no deterrent all the all the kids went into that just so intensive and they were supposed to be real good guys but i mean what uh the visual was pretty miserable in my opinion they wore these mess and hoods and 

Recording: (568/ 2140) 
yeah he uses a lot of different slurs towards gay people 

Recording: (569/ 2140) 
developed over time uh but it is far more socialistic uh but 

Recording: (570/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (571/ 2140) 
yes 

Recording: (572/ 2140) 
with people who want them 

Recording: (573/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (574/ 2140) 
yeah they do their trains are so cool i love those

Recording: (576/ 2140) 
well there that went you know why i mean you can not even have nice stuff in your car anymore 

Recording: (577/ 2140) 
and plus the mental health aspect of it the other thing 

Recording: (578/ 2140) 
no it is very much uh 

Recording: (579/ 2140) 
uh i do not think i would want my kid to go to day care crazy 

Recording: (580/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (581/ 2140) 
that he remembers he he remembers the stepfathers and and that kind of thing just not a good stuff 

Recording: (582/ 2140) 
for a long period of time 

Recording: (583/ 2140) 
that is 

Recording: (584/ 2140) 
and they are real hyper about like you know bad thing for people to do you know that that during getting the smoking there is not as strict about um-hum 

Recording: (585/ 2140) 
gets it 

Recording: (586/ 2140) 
that and the people that enjoy you think what are you why are we hiring these guys you know what do they what do they think 

Recording: (587/ 2140) 
you did i 

Recording: (588/ 2140) 
really 

Recording: (589/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (590/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (591/ 2140) 
i think it should be my way and i think i think you know i think the material should be there i think it is you know dealt with in a common reasonable way and i think it should be accessible to the kids they had three 

Recording: (592/ 2140) 
i guess so i hope that they can keep the school somehow for kids and but it will not be him ing it 

Recording: (593/ 2140) 
yeah i got a son he is a senior daughter by 

Recording: (594/ 2140) 
so 

Recording: (595/ 2140) 
so they got more by by him power if they got there okay 

Recording: (596/ 2140) 
uh i you had women that were working before you had women working before but selfdiscipline is a big thing on family that is part of it selfdiscipline make the things too easy for us oh we can not do without uh you ever you ever try to work for i mean you really struggle to achieve something did it mean more to you than something that was given to you tell me 

Recording: (597/ 2140) 
there is literally you know hundreds of library publications uh and it is a problem is their libraries are facing all the time they can not keep up 

Recording: (598/ 2140) 
i i moved into the dorms late september last fall 

Recording: (599/ 2140) 
no sunlight you know and they do not give him they keep it warm and he is not allowed to sheets or raises or you know other than an electric raiser so he can not kill himself so you just just stock you there is nothing you could do all day for forty years or however until he naturally dies and that to me would be like that to me is actually like that has to be worse like just a agony in the and i think you would have to go and say and like there is really so much you i am not for board games or something but like you can not does not even hear human voice 

Recording: (600/ 2140) 
oh 

Recording: (601/ 2140) 
i have got nothing against christianity but i got something against the way it was brought here 

Recording: (602/ 2140) 
there is uh you know just uh it was i had three spiritual leaders tell me that a great gift came with that that there was it was no accident it was supposed to happen and uh there is a word called sink christity

yeah 

Recording: (613/ 2140) 
the columbus ratioed that i mean he crossed general lines he crossed um party lines he crossed over into all of the city and w winning even dorphy peter is pre think which surprised me you know and and not by just a little small margin i think it was two hundred and some votes which is pretty substantial 

Recording: (614/ 2140) 
um-hum um-hum 

Recording: (615/ 2140) 
one of the hardest 

Recording: (616/ 2140) 
it is just been my experience uh unfortunately um i hope it gets better but uh like i said i have not been ever uh told them my degree matters by any employer or a country to what the news tells you and what people will tell you all go get that that college degree uh you know people told me soon as i got out of college then i needed a master is so 

Recording: (617/ 2140) 
so i pretty much um it is not stressfulful at all i i it is really easy it is not challenging 

Recording: (618/ 2140) 
we are getting more fun stuff all the time but predominantly it is still got way too much cow town personality 

Recording: (619/ 2140) 
i mean there are gays in congress there are gays in the military you know as long as people do not know that they do not feel threatened see and and i i i do not understand that mind set i really do not i do not know why a a man feels threatened by having a gay near them uh i have a couple of gay friends and then one of my friends always says um you know does every man like every woman he sees is he attracted every woman and you know want to go to bed with every woman you know what makes a man is think that just because 

Recording: (620/ 2140) 
really 

Recording: (621/ 2140) 
how about 

Recording: (622/ 2140)

Recording: (623/ 2140) 
they are confused i i do not know but staying home is for everyone and i do not think parenting is for everyone and it really makes me sad when they see somebody you know well we just want our 

Recording: (624/ 2140) 
yeah so that worked out uh so i really had not dated for a long time and then i started dating again and what is weird is you almost go right back and to the patterns because you are so scared you are going to be alone you see yourself going oh i can be with this person and you know in your head this person is not for you i am in luckily um indirectly i met my husband 

Recording: (625/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (626/ 2140) 
yeah eighty four 

Recording: (627/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (628/ 2140) 
they have honors classes which are separate and they are supposed to be better faculty and um smaller classes and a little more challenging 

Recording: (629/ 2140) 
right but how old is your kid 

Recording: (630/ 2140)

Recording: (631/ 2140) 
yeah i do not 

Recording: (632/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (633/ 2140) 
uh civil rights uh uh a a sense in our society that anyone can not you like the american dream in in my opinion is an absolute why 

Recording: (634/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (635/ 2140)

Recording: (636/ 2140) 
franklin park south is wonderful too or franklin park out east is beautiful too off of these broad streets now that is volunteer also their gardens are volunteer they are on a grand scale that is where the uh conservative is 

Recording: (637/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (638/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (639/ 2140) 
yeah why not take advantage of this yeah why not take advantage of that so 

Recording: (640/ 2140) 
because it is hard for us to deal with 

Recording: (641/ 2140) 
and just get out there and have fun and then like we left uh probably like four days a week i know i do not look like it but but i go with them and have a good time so 

Recording: (642/ 2140) 
my sisterinlaw is one of them she is just too stupid 

Recording: (643/ 2140) 
so you are not a kid 

Recording: (644/ 2140) 
just seems like a waste of legislation money 

Recording: (645/ 2140) 
well according to the government she would have 

Recording: (646/ 2140) 
that once you filter it through something it looks different but previous to it yeah there is a lot there there is way too much shared experience to to go off over effectively so when she said look if you are never listening to anything else that i say you will listen to this you need to go to europe it is like okay i will go to europe 

Recording: (647/ 2140) 
now she did she my exwife did uh i would prefer to her would have got continue going to school but she had some problems with some students and stuff 

Recording: (648/ 2140) 
um i i see it as a problem and if i if i if i were african american i would i would not like to see it simply because as uh you know it is it is it is a a child not being brought up in his you know in his tradition but on the other hand i hate i hate to see a child left in foster care or in an orph when he could have a home and um i think uh parents who were willing to 

Recording: (649/ 2140) 
you ask is it okay for us to do it and uh now with her uh i can have dishes out there and the i think uh that are left there for for breakfast and maybe at lunch and uh she she will walk out there i do not know say well grand paul how come you did you they are not done and then she turns right and walks away a and that is right uh-huh and and she made a 

Recording: (650/ 2140) 
and you are not being recorded now 

Recording: (651/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (652/ 2140) 
but why would you make stricter gun laws when you can not even force your traffic laws 

Recording: (653/ 2140) 
that is right and in other words there is so much me anymore instead of us and we 

Recording: (654/ 2140) 
my 

Recording: (655/ 2140) 
getting of some place stable 

Recording: (656/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (657/ 2140)

Recording: (742/ 2140) 
i am going to jump up and start hollering about my face um and and i will not i will not walk into a coffee shop like a lot of my friends will and sit down and start talking to people i do not feel i am ready to do that yet i think there are a i think there is a place in the time for doing certain things like um and this is this is one of the biggest um things that people use as as a reason for faith 

Recording: (743/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (744/ 2140)

Recording: (746/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (747/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (748/ 2140) 
so that is why she is trying to get it out of the way now because you know the the the but he makes you know fairly decent money so you know she does not have to work right now but in order for them to move up the way they want to move up you know after the baby comes she will need to work i have custody of another grandchild 

Recording: (749/ 2140) 
of uh all the off campus kids to like to the police and so like they would start driving around around ten thirty try and bust them for noise on the weekends so it is pretty hectic 

Recording: (750/ 2140) 
they are but it seems like they are going out yeah instead of having we do not do things in hotels and things because they have inhouse 

Recording: (751/ 2140)

Recording: (752/ 2140) 
right real war 

Recording: (753/ 2140) 
support her living conditions or whatever 

Recording: (754/ 2140) 
oh wow oh so you have it on the speed dial 

Recording: (755/ 2140) 
and then remember back on it 

Recording: (756/ 2140) 
and to learn anything it had to be the same thing over and over and over again until he got it right 

Recording: (757/ 2140) 
again they said the 

Recording: (758/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (759/ 2140) 
and then they said well since you are getting that well we will cut cut your pay back to what you would normally draw uh 

Recording: (760/ 2140) 
and that is pretty much the way i felt the whole day because i was just smiling on the inside 

Recording: (761/ 2140) 
exactly 

Recording: (762/ 2140) 
uh it is just there we go again who is right who is wrong i have no idea 

Recording: (763/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (764/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (765/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (766/ 2140) 
yeah yeah so that is pretty much what she likes to do 

Recording: (767/ 2140) 
uh yeah it would be just one more thing 

Recording: (768/ 2140) 
it was mostly caucasian and very few asian and other ethnic 

Recording: (769/ 2140) 
uh that is not true i mean uh some of the older men and older tribes and different tribes um 

Recording: (770/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (771/ 2140) 
yeah well yeah and but you know i mean that that is that is civilization wide 

Recording: (772/ 2140) 
yeah and yeah so i 

Recording: (773/ 2140) 
well i would i would sit down and talk to her like you know if you want to have sex if you really want to have sex you should get on some kind of birth control 

Recording: (774/ 2140) 
you know we my husband and i were just talking about this i was saying i am not in for the you know george straun nineteen eighty four and big brother syndrome and all um my ideal situation would be that somebody decides who should have kids and who is not but i do not think god is going to come down and do that so you know what i mean we can not really decide that but uh to be 

Recording: (775/ 2140) 
so it is still just sitting down on my computer so it is next to it um the only thing it is take it down you can only have half a dozen 

Recording: (776/ 2140) 
yeah it lives in my house in san 

Recording: (777/ 2140) 
just one school so that is how many there is there so 

Recording: (778/ 2140) 
yeah and i i get to argue about stuff there here i am just kind of sitting around 

Recording: (779/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (780/ 2140) 
and we will just watch okay come on it is got to be he made okay he made the three minutes three seconds to laugh he made we went does that make the game an interesting deal 

Recording: (781/ 2140) 
and i would definitely keep an eye out and you know figure out what is going on you know 

Recording: (782/ 2140) 
and i mean it is basically any time i have free i mean it is not like i have a set schedule of when i have to work and things like that it is just whenever i feel like i have to do it 

Recording: (783/ 2140) 
then then that was always her main focus 

Recording: (784/ 2140) 
yeah i went to columbia public schools and uh then yeah on the on always over on the west side the same area of town always lived there so they are now uh came up here to ohio uh got my bachelor is in uh english lit and then went to case western reserve for a mess there is a site i wanted to go somewhere else in the country which i got my library degree and the only job i could find was here in columbus 

Recording: (785/ 2140) 
you know and they some of them spoke out where they should speak out 

Recording: (786/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (787/ 2140) 
but she is doing fine uh she was dating somebody i do not know whether they really got married or not you know because i do not really have that much communication with her with some guy younger than her and i talked to him he seemed like pretty decent guy yeah 

Recording: (788/ 2140) 
but then you will have to have people running the machinery and checking the machinery 

Recording: (789/ 2140) 
ten to fifteen minutes so yeah we stay pretty close with each other a lot 

Recording: (790/ 2140) 
i goes do you hear me and i go yeah because you got a trip to be out at the airport at four thirty and i go oh he says you hear me and i go yeah yeah he goes get some sleep and he turns the lights off all the door shut and uh i am laying there and i am like i have been home like three hours and now i am just fumes and i thought i know a college education does not guarantee you financial security but i thought what am i doing working you know from dust i mean gone to way past uh six days a week and making 

Recording: (791/ 2140) 
the um i said i did not belong to any groups and that is not true i belong to ohio design or craftsman and um uh they in the in the shops they try to limit it to ohio artists but the membership is is national so uh it is not it is not really closed it is just hum 

Recording: (792/ 2140) 
oh 

Recording: (793/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (794/ 2140) 
well yes sir 

Recording: (795/ 2140) 
that is 

Recording: (796/ 2140) 
no and i uh yeah it is mixture between force dump and archie bunker 

Recording: (797/ 2140) 
whether it is over exaggerated or you know none of us grew up shooting people or this you know we do not own a fire arm but we played with guns and played cow to all these so i just wonder whether this is really you know but society is a lot different now 

Recording: (798/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (799/ 2140) 
i went shopping around for a new attorney and it took me about seven before uh pardon me seven attorneys before i found one that was adequate in terms of knowledge of head injury and brain injury because his father was a north surgeon and uh he had experience and expertise he is and uh bringing up the uh the differences uh in the reality of of a brain injury 

Recording: (800/ 2140) 
uh 

Recording: (801/ 2140) 
huh 

Recording: (802/ 2140) 
and uh where my mom was a a young high school student just graduating from high school and so they got together there moved to california 

Recording: (803/ 2140) 
but if you love if you love someone you want them to do what is right and you want them to learn and if that is the punishment they have to pay for something they did wrong you still love them but you are loving other people also and in other words you are not laying the fact this is my child so he can get away with murder but this one over here i am not going to let get away with it no i am sorry have my child committed something that this other one i am sorry you have done that dear but and i love you dearly but i tried to teach you different i do not know where you went wrong i do not want to do it wrong whatever but you got to pay the penalty um 

Recording: (804/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (805/ 2140) 
you know which when you show it is a that are way of putting it um 

Recording: (806/ 2140) 
my brother knows about it and my mother and it is the only ones in my family that are even aware of it so because we just do not want to be bothered with all the questions 

Recording: (807/ 2140) 
oh understanding 

Recording: (808/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (809/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (810/ 2140) 
she would pamper the kids and well from where we live to we live just all i do not know whether you are acquainted with northand of plumber and anyway indianola avenue is one of the main thoroughfare and uh we lived about a a block on a half off of indianola and then just another block was a small shopping center where there was a drug store and a farmers shop 

Recording: (811/ 2140) 
a d h d and um they do this uh they were trying to make it to where they he would calm down and they would not have to give him so much medicine and she reads a lot of magazines and articles about you know the problem and um i guess uh he had uh if you would change they are diet if you take out milk or something i think it was did you know twoslers had milk in them 

Recording: (812/ 2140) 
would you hold it 

Recording: (813/ 2140) 
but uh 

Recording: (814/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (815/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (816/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (817/ 2140) 
yeah and and everybody is going to associate with the people that they feel comfortable with so you know and fortunately as that guy this guy in particular is a center for the football as he grew up older you know uh you realized that he was not as big as important as he uh he blew out his knee for uh oh you you know uh by which i went to school with larry hunter who is the uh basketball coach for uh ou now and uh yeah 

Recording: (818/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (819/ 2140) 
they did not make it into the history books yeah 

Recording: (820/ 2140) 
that um encompasses the uh theory that all things happen for a reason even though it seems like it is even though it seems like it is an accident and uh there is a flow of spirit in this world things are moving at a pace that they are supposed to move at and things happen and death is part of life physical death and that is 

Recording: (821/ 2140) 
believe it or not uh they are not really i would not call them need freaks but um we tease them because my parents and her live within a couple of miles those of each other and double and and you have to take off your shoes when you go which is really it is amazing how good their carpet looks 

Recording: (822/ 2140) 
but our had to start on development so 

Recording: (823/ 2140) 
no because they are gonna learn that on their own um i i personally think that is a choice i do not think you are born that way because i i have friends that are homosexual and um you know i do not believe in what they are doing but i do not do everything right every day so i still love them and they are my friends and blah blah blah because but i have also known people that word that way and now are homosexual and are much happier and they realized that it was just a choice they 

Recording: (824/ 2140) 
yeah they are 

Recording: (825/ 2140) 
i am not agreeing with my grandma seems she seems to think okay maybe but if you put a discount for in there i would love it that is what she said i was like okay 

Recording: (826/ 2140) 
right wow 

Recording: (827/ 2140) 
so yeah 

Recording: (828/ 2140) 
i wish they could 

Recording: (829/ 2140) 
oh man i wish i knew what to buy this week 

Recording: (830/ 2140) 
under a house but it is just more time consuming soon than i think i am ready 

Recording: (831/ 2140) 
get it from us so 

Recording: (832/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (833/ 2140) 
oh yeah there there 

Recording: (834/ 2140) 
yeah and yeah and i would not do that i if i was you know had no children and 

Recording: (835/ 2140) 
so but that is you know i ended up settling the time i got most of the money what little i had i invested some and then i made some bad investments when i went out off my medication and uh you know blew it you know so that was my responsibility and my fault but but uh you know how it was just uh years of penn up frustration and then just 

Recording: (836/ 2140) 
um-hum yeah 

Recording: (837/ 2140) 
that is perfect 

Recording: (838/ 2140) 
yeah just one concert 

Recording: (839/ 2140) 
and i do not think that it is just executed properly so i would almost rather have it not at all 

Recording: (840/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (841/ 2140) 
women really do not need to wait long but it is there for them and they do participate um 

Recording: (842/ 2140) 
oh okay well the reason i asked was a lot seems to me a lot of the impetus for going to church or going back to church for people is when their kid gets old enough to go to sunday school starting asking questions about religion and you are saying well i suppose i could answer all these but yeah 

Recording: (843/ 2140) 
um no english 

Recording: (844/ 2140) 
i do not think so 

Recording: (845/ 2140) 
um 

Recording: (846/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (847/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (848/ 2140) 
and part of it was just being stupid but it was down around the mountain vernon area and uh they got very little money but i was not heard 

Recording: (849/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (850/ 2140) 
i would say and then i would also say that you know uh because a a a number of reasons that people do not vote for school levys now is because they do not have kids in the schools you know but education is the foundation of a democracy and if you do not have an educated citizenry uh your democracy could go down the drain um that was why thomas jefferson and found that so many schools are you know the the university of virginia and believed in education you know because he said without an educated citizen you will not understand the issues you know but 

Recording: (851/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (852/ 2140) 
um 

Recording: (853/ 2140) 
humum 

Recording: (854/ 2140) 
groups and different groups but i can not help but thinking that if it was bad enough that you would do something like that that you know had to have been more than just you know sort of normal jobs versus whatever so i think it should be more i do not know i mean even you know i went to a private 

Recording: (855/ 2140) 
and you know you have a hard thing there but then if you teach the teachers that they are not going to be quiet and they are not going to you know um look at this flatter 

Recording: (856/ 2140)

it will be a long campaign i know it is interesting that that gore suggested that reagan suggested two two debates a week and i just can not imagine what you two debates a week for a month yeah it is like well at least they could get things out into the open but they have the chance but who wants to watch that much has the time to watch that much 

Recording: (863/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (864/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (865/ 2140)

Recording: (869/ 2140) 
uh well there was a house i did not want it so that was easy 

Recording: (870/ 2140) 
i in fact that time one time i kind of wanted to be a teacher and everything but course that would have been uh forty nine so it would have been probably what about twenty four so that about twenty five years and so i think we are getting ready to get to have a house anyway 

Recording: (871/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (872/ 2140) 
you know so basically oh yeah my work but to me it is kind of stupid you know because what you are saying is we are going to take this law and we are really going to stick you on this law but to hell with all the other oh so is that really fair 

Recording: (873/ 2140) 
it was uh back in the sixties so you know 

Recording: (874/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (875/ 2140) 
i mean i do not think they should get rid of it for hilarious thing but you know there is plenty of malls to go to that is okay it is not a big deal to me to tell you the truth no actually i live i live closer i live east um-hum 

Recording: (876/ 2140) 
i remember it being it is a pretty positive thing for me i was never upset about the fact that they were not together because they both gave me a lot of attention but um about i think that was maybe five or six when mom moved into an apartment in german village 

Recording: (877/ 2140) 
yeah my brother is well he is the oldest oldest but two sisters pretty much all the ones that i really care about two sisters and their husbands 

Recording: (878/ 2140) 
more expensive so everyone has a lot less and here it is like everything is so relatively inexpensive that it is like you know picture frames or something there it might be you know twenty five dollars for one so you buy one here oh you know they are five dollars a piece let us buy five you know 

Recording: (879/ 2140) 
yep 

Recording: (880/ 2140) 
uh-huh you are going across the street you know on four lane highway and you said they are going they 

Recording: (881/ 2140) 
but at night it is pretty fun and you just floor it and fly right through the middle of downtown um improvements i would just say keep i would just say um-hum 

Recording: (882/ 2140) 
yeah well i think chiropractors have been more popular for the same type of reason yeah 

Recording: (883/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (884/ 2140) 
as he was speaking and and as he started to speak i realized too another thing that i really feel has a tremendous impression on how we as people are doing here but how the politicians are because the world in essence it is getting smaller because the communication has gotten better and all these other countries and us are just like all one country anymore or something i think that is had a tremendous influence also on and our politics and on we as a people 

Recording: (885/ 2140) 
see tomorrow i mean hold them feel the warm of the body uh hear the conversation quietly other than uh hearing okay time to get out of here you know with a bigger rust to say but it was pleasant sort of remark these kind i can see a lab or i can write a whole book on that on this on the entry or quarters uh but it is these kinds of things they are very elementary really they are very elementary i guess to 

Recording: (886/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (887/ 2140) 
right right he would go for weeks he would get mad at me and that would speak to me when i was growing up for a week or two at a time my mother would say please nancy i changed my name i went to college i just decided i am out of here i am everything is gone and so she would say uh nancy please just talk to your father just for just for my sake please and i would think i am a child here i should not have to be the one to make peace with this family if he does not want to talk to me i do not need him i do not have to talk to him 

Recording: (888/ 2140) 
well it is sort of like the sociology of like clicks you know like how how that develops like how people like some people seek to like fit in like i think that that is a real strong uh 

Recording: (889/ 2140) 
really yeah i do not feel old at all i mean i you know a lot of people think wow you should know what you want to do or you know and and i guess there is different phases like uh mazda is highericky what is that the uh the higherucky of needs mazda anyway 

Recording: (890/ 2140) 
will not let him beat south speed right now but 

Recording: (891/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (892/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (893/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (894/ 2140) 
well it was both really because there is been kids lived there since i lived there that was thirteen years ago and being that long in the same neighborhood just does not really get it with me 

Recording: (895/ 2140) 
yeah from the track yeah um actually a lot of our stuff did pretty well while we were off so did make you feel as needed as you wanted to do anything you know yeah uh you know we got a lot of our buildings up and running before they went on strike and i think the bosses knew this was coming so a lot of the air conditioning was already running by then 

Recording: (896/ 2140) 
yeah exactly i know 

Recording: (897/ 2140) 
yeah uh-huh 

Recording: (898/ 2140) 
it is always been my feeling and and uh i try to be fair in the way i grade uh you know it is i try to be as objective as i can sometimes i because i think it is important that people learn how to write i would ask all my classes to write an essay or a short 

Recording: (899/ 2140) 
you know 

Recording: (900/ 2140) 
yes 

Recording: (901/ 2140) 
that is pretty extreme 

Recording: (902/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (903/ 2140) 
oh gosh 

Recording: (904/ 2140) 
their ideas i mean the guys are trying to look older the girls are trying to look younger 

Recording: (905/ 2140) 
or then they had to after that they had to lottery number and that was not but they were you know if you got your number was picked i mean i do not know what should be worse knowing that you are going to get a nose or something being able prepare for it or uh because i have had friends that gotten uh numbers and everything you know and getting a high number and sitting there going oh my gosh so 

Recording: (906/ 2140) 
um it was just yeah i guess the mafia was a big problem they just take over everything and they they do not pay their workers and most people are not mafia they do not get paid 

Recording: (907/ 2140) 
but i do know my my my brotherinlaw mentioned to his uh parents is that gosh what a sacrifice you guys did for us and he is just turned fifty and they do not have any kids and he says well i do not know how you do it well for one thing they probably did a lot of sacrifice and when you sacrifice it becomes it makes you more humble 

Recording: (908/ 2140) 
uh the younger kids would not think anything about it 

Recording: (909/ 2140) 
uh a type of lifestyle and that lifestyle is gone everybody is independent everybody is going their own ways and if you happen to be lucky enough to find somebody that is looking in the same direction you are and as equally as independent then it might it might work but um i you know and he knows why each person gets i mean each one of them was in individual situation and uh 

Recording: (910/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (911/ 2140) 
uh-huh the watchtows yeah you kind of like you know look it up and say you know somebody is you know got their sides on me yeah because that is uh i can only you know that is like the world war two stuff you know there is like the remains i am sure if it is like if you get to see the wall it is like there i mean i am sure there is like that there uh uh the from what i understand it was like 

Recording: (912/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (913/ 2140) 
so however this works out you know i do not know i just i am just like okay she just says i just want to get it over with and see now she you know 

Recording: (914/ 2140) 
oh really 

Recording: (915/ 2140) 
to be close so i did not have to drive 

Recording: (916/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (917/ 2140) 
see that is great though 

Recording: (918/ 2140) 
um so i mean basically my opinion on that is just leave it up to them i mean if they want to take the risks obviously they know 

Recording: (919/ 2140) 
if if if if you say buy buy from those unscoupleous business people i say uh gee these guys got me a credit what happens to that person that files bankruptcy uh my bankruptcy okay i will do something else because the next time 

Recording: (920/ 2140) 
well i really think that is happening right now because i think that i do not know what the divorce statistics have been recently but i do see that more people are getting or staying married because those that do not those that would have gotten the divorce they are not bothering to get married to begin with they are just living together and that they separate so what and i think that 

Recording: (921/ 2140) 
yeah and it has the least amount of people which is kind of neat as far as tourism so 

Recording: (922/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (923/ 2140) 
i am looking for a part time job as we speak i have been like doing temporary on and off as a thing with that is you can work you know for four or five months and then nothing and then like that so right now i am looking for something permanent 

Recording: (924/ 2140) 
you know just experiencing someone for who they are and so she is 

Recording: (925/ 2140) 
a couple of restaurants or something but i mean it is it is different when you think of other cities you know it is more like a downtown is where you go to hang out but here it is like campus or more of a 

Recording: (926/ 2140) 
it was just so i did not object to that one at all 

Recording: (927/ 2140) 
that that would be seriously fun but uh it depends if you work industry you get money 

Recording: (928/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (929/ 2140) 
well 

Recording: (930/ 2140) 
and they were just wild you know i just ran every minute and i took it as a substitute and did not know from day to day you know whether it is going to keep it i finally had to say i can not do this twenty seven kidner cars i am sorry i can not do this by myself 

Recording: (931/ 2140) 
um me or 

Recording: (932/ 2140) 
yeah drugs right yeah yeah see that is what she is interested in right now she is looking to see if she can find someplace to work this summer even if it is just a day a week or some clinic or something just to to see what is goes on day to day 

Recording: (933/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (934/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (935/ 2140) 
uh it is been should pretty it is uh yeah you know you are not around here is it it is a it is a classic school over on the west side 

Recording: (936/ 2140) 
and uh i just told them what it has to do with my belief system say you are in violation of the first amendment you know so and then they realized that i was not stupid so you know they just made things more and more difficult for me you know so i just decided to since they were not going to change those i was just going to leave you know but so it is you know it is it is a hard way to choose to walk uh if you are an idealistic person it is i mean just more so 

Recording: (937/ 2140) 
is it any worse than baseball cards or you know 

Recording: (938/ 2140) 
and he said do divorce more acceptable divorce should never be acceptable 

Recording: (939/ 2140) 
yeah i had a cousin that went on she she was in school for that and um as you could tell i like to do office work i 

Recording: (940/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (941/ 2140) 
yeah that is how he gets so much money he says i will be paid this much and i will be given this many and have this much minimum per day or i am not working for you and they just say no no no we will not do that you know and then they will call back a week later okay we will take you you have some really good stories about that oh yeah yes golfing is in the businesses and also with uh unix which is 

Recording: (942/ 2140) 
um 

Recording: (943/ 2140) 
whole lot more places to live it seems like everywhere i turn there is construction and and you know you go down one one road and then you wait a couple years if you do not go in that area and it is all changed it looks all different so and that is mainly like looking up bathroom and three fifteen or things like that 

Recording: (944/ 2140) 
you know he was in oh yeah they both worked during college and i guess my dad was on the gi bill after the war so that is how he got in here had to work some parttime work to get his degree uh-huh it is it is just east broad street just frankly and part conservative 

Recording: (945/ 2140) 
i mean that goes along with my systems in my life i mean we are going to send our child i already know to parochial schools there is no way i am going to send him to a public school and even my my husband is a um boy scout um leader and just listening to the boys there he he he did a program last night on respect 

Recording: (946/ 2140) 
the ultimate would probably be a part time thing you know but neither one of our positions offer any type of part time we are we have some friends that do that we are they only go two days a week or something which is they get a little bit of both so 

Recording: (947/ 2140) 
do i think they will oh yes i think they definitely will i think there is so much heavy uh political and financial well i am a reverse that statement uh there is so much heavy financial influents upon the political uh influence that it is almost a four going conclusion and if it does not occur this within this year and uh there may be another vote in another year or next uh next election but i think that in fact it will go 

Recording: (948/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (949/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (950/ 2140) 
you know 

Recording: (951/ 2140) 
yeah that is what i am saying 

Recording: (952/ 2140) 
yeah at uh yeah they they have got two different uh articles in there uh about well they had a big article uh back when uh who was it jesse jackson was down there or something um down there and everything but then you go to a lot of other extremes you know where you set turn these people would not wanna live in columbia so 

Recording: (953/ 2140) 
i mean i think he is done some positive things that whole thing about um as as far as like your student loans and being able to get into just help me and i think you know all this that as far as some of the issues go i think that that i feel pretty similar to the way he does um some of his foreign policy think i think i have gone pretty recently but i mean i think i do not i do not know i mean i 

Recording: (954/ 2140) 
yeah from what i hear actually the like the emily in the um university of chicago you have to work really hard because they get all the kids who wish they would have gotten to harvard and then start you know try to make it up by working harder you get the actual harvard nobody works because they are like we already made it you know 

Recording: (955/ 2140) 
uh i remember when you know when we were we had you know some movies like like that but they were like the barry boys and stuff you know we are uh you pretty much knew it was all fake anyway you know but and to me that is fake you know uh and i never really thought about when i was growing up as it was what was real and everything i i always knew that by either again you know by my dad being 

Recording: (956/ 2140) 
he he is a very he is a disappointment 

Recording: (957/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (958/ 2140) 
will do this it will do this so we checked out the catholic school and they were organized that way and it just was a better better match for him and then my daughter went to school it was just easier to take him to the same school yeah and and that goes back and and it reminded me of another thing i wanted to say about why the discipline and and behavior that would be different in the catholic school is when you are paying big you are paying bucks you know it is four without forty five hundred hours a year for us to send her to school they had three 

Recording: (959/ 2140) 
yeah i figure right now i might as well take advantage of it 

Recording: (960/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (961/ 2140) 
businessmen my dad and i have been screwing around with stock for years um i have been in contact with a um day trading firm down in west virginia and they are starting an intern program sometime i do not even know but if that if that opens up i will probably seriously consider going down to west virginia uh they are in richmond west virginia now richmond yeah i have been saying west virginia have i they are in virginia sorry they are they are home bases in uh richmond virginia 

Recording: (962/ 2140) 
yeah and then i went into the army in nineteen forty spring of nineteen forty one before fort harvard and that was my service for oh four and a half years in italy most of that time north africa and italy and uh i admitted i i got before i went into service and so 

Recording: (963/ 2140) 
then when i found out there were so many openings and special ed so and then i found out later that speech therapy has a very good background for ld because a lot of these elderly kids have language deficit and language problems they they can not you know like express themselves on paper or they do not process things correctly auditorally so that is the perfect background to work with all d kids i did not know i was doing that at the time but 

Recording: (964/ 2140) 
i made a difference 

Recording: (965/ 2140) 
that is great 

Recording: (966/ 2140) 
yes and uh uh when we were in boy scouts we got kicked out of it 

Recording: (967/ 2140) 
and uh well she the the people that own it are starting to build it up now but it is been like that it was the first apartment community uh in but so it was built in thirty eight i guess 

Recording: (968/ 2140) 
um yeah people that live there i mean we have got the the you know the indian department stores right down there on high street and and a couple of asian groceries but i you know i i i do not know where they live i mean it it seems it seems like for those stores to be opening there they must be somewhere in clintonville but i do not i do not know 

Recording: (969/ 2140) 
all right 

Recording: (970/ 2140) 
oh 

Recording: (971/ 2140) 
i do not know i i would not personally like think that the parents should be held responsible i mean they do have you know a certain amount of responsibility for the fact that they should have been more aware and and especially because i mean i believe that those at least one of the two had been in counseling and had to you know was doing it a christian management or something like that um you know you would think that if they were going through something like that you would just sort of you know maybe 

Recording: (972/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (973/ 2140) 
was not worth hearing about it you know it is like you know 

Recording: (974/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (975/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (976/ 2140) 
well basically it is the same thing here but some of your management is real good i have seen people that that you know are super but i have seen people that are bad the problem is you get a bad management and it can make your life hell i do not care who you are 

Recording: (977/ 2140) 
all you do is you just keep your records of of um you know what you spent on things and then there is a form you fill out and how much you have if you have taken any depreciation you know you need to basically put that back in into doctor costs and then there is a percentage that goes on your schedule either goes on the front of your form that goes into your income and then it is just taxed it is just no it is really not that hard 

Recording: (978/ 2140) 
then 

Recording: (979/ 2140) 
uh-huh yeah i am just learning the area so but i like it so far it seems really nice and uh it seems like there is a lot more to do in columbus obviously but 

Recording: (980/ 2140) 
and why do i think that is um 

Recording: (981/ 2140) 
everyone might experiment or try or make a mistake but the way he is handling it saying i am not even going to think and find that question over and over and over if he did not do it he might as well just be like no i did not do it 

Recording: (982/ 2140) 
downtown which is where this my one of my orchestras plays a lot and uh we sang in other different kinds of churches and said what we liked about and what we did not maybe it had some feedback i think the new building is acoustically very good it is certainly much better than old christian center because i do not know if you have seen a picture or anything of the church but the old christian center was designed by a modern architect 

Recording: (983/ 2140) 
at this point um i am not uh i am not against the urban schools but if it was my own personal child i would moved to a suburban area until columbus gets their act together they are in so it is such bad shape right now that i do think the state will take over the columbus public schools in two years yeah they have threatened it uh and if they do not pull their scores up uh they will you know 

Recording: (984/ 2140) 
and move on um that is that is basically my fear but uh as one of the guys tried to help me several is and i am afraid of that too so because right there in that pit there that is god now if you remember that there is nothing in here that can and hurt you even as hot as it gets you know and when you think about that you try not to think too much where and there although 

Recording: (985/ 2140) 
or they you know they come back to visit me sometimes from the high school 

Recording: (986/ 2140) 
yeah it is ridiculous i mean plus it is a nationally recognized school so to agree from a house state i mean you could go anywhere in the nation someone is at least going to recognize because of the big it is a big big name asheland that would be more of a cell i would be like okay we it is small it is private it is credit but still 

Recording: (987/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (988/ 2140) 
it does not matter how much money they are given for their education they 

Recording: (989/ 2140) 
yeah i think mostly they did uh i was kind of surprised um which classes is in i think this was in the better introduction to the arts class kind of surprised that one of the students in my class thought it was very hard and i did not think it was that hard at all but she wrote me some kind of you know at the last class or before the last class that she had a straight a average at the school before that my class and i was giving her a b and she was 

Recording: (990/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (991/ 2140) 
uh i do not know where he got the contact but anyway he went up to illinois i went and joined a national guard out uh which was field of colorado area and uh with the expectations of their being mobilized which they were and uh so he he was home one weekend and talked to me about no no well field of backyard i was exposed to that when i was in rotc at aames so i thought that is be better than carrying 

Recording: (992/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (993/ 2140) 
enough kids out there that need love and 

Recording: (994/ 2140) 
but and when it came down to it i mean the what was the protest really about you know and i am not being clear because i am not exactly sure where i am going with it i am very cynical of uh about about the world i have inherited uh because i see a world in which my political view have been silence by fifty years of of you know like international politics uh and sort of like propaganda 

Recording: (995/ 2140) 
um i went to let you see i applied to emerie harvard duke university of chicago and washington university so i got into three of those um they they were neat places 

Recording: (996/ 2140) 
i have no idea 

Recording: (997/ 2140) 
oh yes 

Recording: (998/ 2140) 
yeah he was up there too the old guy with a beard and a twed jacket and uh it was pretty cool and uh they said most you know most of students that are not even from delaware 

Recording: (999/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (1000/ 2140) 
right right that is the amazing thing about this country is that there is enough space in the united states and north america that you can have all these hum 

Recording: (1001/ 2140) 
something to think about 

Recording: (1002/ 2140) 
yeah they got it spring break a couple of teachers are taking a bunch of kids 

Recording: (1003/ 2140) 
you know they should not know where the keys are if they were used to the gun cabinet or whatever i mean the fact that you know how do you explain your way out of your kids taking guns uh 

Recording: (1004/ 2140) 
i 

Recording: (1005/ 2140) 
um 

Recording: (1006/ 2140) 
he is an educatorator which is all the more reason the whole school because he sees it and he is like yeah they 

Recording: (1007/ 2140) 
that is going to well i might make national news i just 

Recording: (1008/ 2140) 
that is my dad has red hair and blue eyes so 

Recording: (1009/ 2140) 
i so um chris and i uh spent the rest of the evening calling people i i got in my head and i did not want anybody to say how is your dad doing and so the best way to deal with that situation was to call globally across the board plus it was a fun psychological experiment just as as they go because how often do you get to tell people so i i said hi how you doing ah no i have not talked to 

Recording: (1010/ 2140) 
well um see he moved into an apartment over on eleventh avenue

Recording: (1087/ 2140) 
there i just think you can not you can not call for across the board raises there are definitely some people there who deserve a lot more money than what they are getting 

Recording: (1088/ 2140) 
so and it probably did and it probably did have something to do with it uh because after all so much speaking up and they want to do things my no um 

Recording: (1089/ 2140) 
yes 

Recording: (1090/ 2140) 
out of touch with everything that is going on in the room and i do not have a like a regular size class like i will have five six seven kids at a time and believe me when you got seven high school

Recording: (1092/ 2140) 
oh 

Recording: (1093/ 2140) 
you tend to go do the actually 

Recording: (1094/ 2140) 
to see the end yeah yeah 

Recording: (1095/ 2140) 
yeah they could be yeah 

Recording: (1096/ 2140)

about once a week my wife sees her usually more than 

Recording: (1103/ 2140) 
a little bit faster uh but and and then when i get out of the service i get twenty two you know it is kind of like behind everybody you know as far as my age group and stuff that did not have to go and uh so i had had a lot of uh good times as far as that goes and you know cleaning a house the next gal you know some well that stuff you know i mean a lot of people do not there is just a lot of lax stuff goes on today in my opinion but 

Recording: (1104/ 2140)

um and had to deal with being welcome back into the fold of star fleet by being uh first officer on the ship but still had to balance his his new life uh i saw so much potential for uh interesting stuff with that but i feel that he is become just uh just another character to deliver lines for most of the episodes they have seen from this 

Recording: (1107/ 2140) 
i mean i think they could try if their you know their kids try and push them away they should not you know let their kids push them away you know i guess you can not make your kid go out with you and do things 

Recording: (1108/ 2140) 
too much of a role model figure anymore um i mean obviously it should be someone that they respect but i can not say that they would be like oh well he does it so i am going to have to do it too or whatever 

Recording: (1109/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1110/ 2140)

Recording: (1122/ 2140) 
yeah yeah that is very true 

Recording: (1123/ 2140) 
they it was it was all very progress you could tell you could really tell that they had an opinion about this um we talked about positives and negatives and being think about um like the means that is done some of the stuff i already knew 

Recording: (1124/ 2140) 
i really do not think we are incredibly racist

Recording: (1131/ 2140) 
you know what my parents never did because um they knew i was always levelheaded i always had a lot of boy friends you know but i always i always felt like i was waiting for the right one 

Recording: (1132/ 2140) 
some of them did and some of them were just complete idiots but you find that anywhere 

Recording: (1133/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1134/ 2140) 
um-hum but that is kind of it it you know kind of came through where they were like uh when i was growing up we had the uh the you know you had your rocks and everything of course you had your uh what you we were called debts you know uh and i was kind of like in the middle you know i played a little bit of pork you know but also associated with them and they were basically potheads you know and everything so uh so like i say i you know i was kind of uh associated

Recording: (1153/ 2140) 
they saw us have difficult times and they saw us saw us our spouse is crying together forgiving one another arguing with another just as much as you could have been in human relations they saw that they saw the love for one another they saw overnight where i would start care carrying from a dad because my mother died instantly you know like short term an hour and now he has struck i did not know whether i stayed all their lives and i had learned all that and 

Recording: (1154/ 2140)

Recording: (1162/ 2140) 
no asking each other opinions or anything like that

that is that whatever they call a thirty three that is on the ballot 

Recording: (1197/ 2140) 
i so i had a tendency that it would really help them um it would just be better if somebody could you know keep their eyes open or if we had um more counselors or think is like that to deal with everything including that 

Recording: (1198/ 2140) 
a computer calls you

Recording: (1204/ 2140) 
can have a gun um i mean if they want a college education um yeah it is it is not fair but for for you growing up and going into a lifestyle i would prefer having their colleges paid for and then being productive citizens than somebody robbing me someday because they did not get much i mean you know that is a broad spectrum and i know it is not all that could not ride um yeah it would upset me but hopefully i would step back from it a little bit 

Recording: (1205/ 2140)

Recording: (1221/ 2140) 
no matter 

Recording: (1222/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1223/ 2140) 
and he was always like really red faced and the kids would say you know he went out at lunch and got drunk and came back and that was one of the better schools in columbus and and you know i just saw a lot of that i just saw a lot of um uh principals driving big fabulous cars and 

Recording: (1224/ 2140) 
you know at lunchtime they would be cutting their next class you know there is two different lunch times sometimes they just alternate and take two lunches or go to one class go to one lunch and skip after then but 

Recording: (1225/ 2140) 
yeah they really like it they have a huge house in the middle of nowhere out on a farm and my brotherinlaw bought uh his father wendy is business is out and so they have like six wendy is out there so but it is out in the middle of the nowhere that was the whole problem we tried to get him to move and try to getting to do this years and years ago and nobody wanted to move to nebraska he was doing them from ohio which is really tough running five wendy is in 

Recording: (1226/ 2140) 
and 

Recording: (1227/ 2140) 
and we were staying at his grandpa and his grandpa would sit on the back porch and see all kinds of racial slars towards black people 

Recording: (1228/ 2140) 
but uh 

Recording: (1229/ 2140) 
to turn on the news they do not really cover my husband comes from a journalistic background and he will be like that is not news you know what i mean it is just we get so uh let us here and watch playing catch for twelve hours instead of watching i do not know what little house in the prairie i dont know but i am being facetious but what do you mean 

Recording: (1230/ 2140) 
it is like it is um it is like there is fires and stuff that you see or whatever and um and you and you get directions to but it will be in a you know there is a a bunch of different places will be in you know like a sports arena or something or or it depends on big there i mean there is ones where there is like two hundred people there is ones where like five this one is for like a thousand there is one is for like three thousand and like there is one is in canada but i did not i did not go to one but some of my friends went to where there is like fifteen thousand people there 

Recording: (1231/ 2140) 
like politically uh well like um like i was in high school i was involved in like the democratic in the democratic campaign and just stuff like that just uh i would like to do something think i am learning more about the environment because of this job but i would like to do something otherwise like uh a lot of like business leaders uh they are very they have become very conservative when they get higher up because like the tax breaks they want to support things like that but i think there should be a good mix like uh 

Recording: (1232/ 2140) 
to get bags of apples and chicken sandwiches and apple juice but but then here come the uh cooper is wife and it is daughter and like it is and i am thinking they are putting all these his family up in the hotel the night before game i mean i do not know i just thought it was very strange that he would have this whole family staying there with him all none of those boys get to bring anybody you know i mean 

Recording: (1233/ 2140) 
there is a huge wind tunnel yeah 

Recording: (1234/ 2140) 
have a very general uh opposition to this kind of thing uh no matter where it is anymore uh my being seventy six years of age has a major you are bearing because i see the the total destruction of our center cities uh and i say when i speak of center cities i do not necessarily mean just city is the size of columbus which is which is the largest one to say to ohio now but i am talking places like washington courhout which maybe have fifteen thousand or 

Recording: (1235/ 2140) 
yes i did 

Recording: (1236/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1237/ 2140) 
the government is always good for money 

Recording: (1238/ 2140) 
but san francisco is is kind of like like like uh like 

Recording: (1239/ 2140) 
i said they got babysitting my fire but i guess you you survive okay because you are here you are still teaching 

Recording: (1240/ 2140) 
yeah like a little kid and he he did not say anything to me but he made my aunt feel like a little pile of dirt a sister and uh so he just really showed out that day but what is so funny is our baby my that has red hair and our baby has red hair 

Recording: (1241/ 2140) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (1242/ 2140) 
our argentina is worthless um-hum basically um we were complaining about it like earlier during the year three complaints uh formal complaints been file against him and he is still worth tompson to change the bleach water like more than once a week it is just really disgusting so we had these times come in one day and he was we went in like in shock it was so clean 

Recording: (1243/ 2140) 
uh-huh yeah it is an old an old eyesore that they should have got rid of years ago but 

Recording: (1244/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1245/ 2140) 
one thing okay go ahead well i one thing um i was thinking you know that i have a perspective on that maybe lots of people do not is how columbus is grown up 

Recording: (1246/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1247/ 2140) 
and i do not know if it is quite that bad but but it was certainly somethings that he is been doing that are not i do not proved up and i am not real up on that 

Recording: (1248/ 2140) 
i am living over on iowa uh if you on the other side of high street you know mcdonald is right by high street it is like 

Recording: (1249/ 2140) 
i think that is too young to talk about birth control methods and everything but you know with aids and that as rampant as is now and there is so many more women that have it um start off as mostly men um women have got to know as at an early age you know about these different diseases and things 

Recording: (1250/ 2140) 
but on the other hand it is not good to let your mind wander off i i find myself having to focus sometimes have not to really um-hum 

Recording: (1251/ 2140) 
like management here 

Recording: (1252/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1253/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1254/ 2140) 
uh-huh the reds uh more so than indians back my younger days because they were not worth it down but 

Recording: (1255/ 2140) 
oh yeah i would 

Recording: (1256/ 2140) 
i was in seventy eight um and then i have just i have stayed there and it is grown a lot in the work humum it is an interesting place to work because uh well first the job is almost a different job every year because so many changes are happening or trying to stay out in front of what in front of what library innovation in front of web and that innovation and trying to incorporate it all so it is it you know it is 

Recording: (1257/ 2140) 
but um um one time i i read somewhere that a a mexican lady who came across the border to have her baby and they put the little band on and they wrote female and then they wrote her last name she said to her husband when he came over to see her well they have already named her look from molly 

Recording: (1258/ 2140) 
and he always said well i am so allergic but then he did not have any problems 

Recording: (1259/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1260/ 2140) 
yeah i hear 

Recording: (1261/ 2140) 
but um 

Recording: (1262/ 2140) 
well how he felt and knowing that we were not neglecting him or two different things we have always emphasized that knowing what is right or knowing that what is just is one thing is dealing with the emotions is another one 

Recording: (1263/ 2140) 
but he just did not have a very high opinion in the army 

Recording: (1264/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (1265/ 2140) 
yeah well he thinks he can do it 

Recording: (1266/ 2140) 
wow 

Recording: (1267/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1268/ 2140) 
i want i do not want somebody i i want them to be able to feel like they can punish him and they can pray and they can 

Recording: (1269/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1270/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1271/ 2140) 
um oh yeah like when when they are in new york and it is all real loud and there is like cars and sirens in the background and stuff or when people um you know like this lady asked me she was like the she was telling me about she was getting like some bedroom set or something like that like some sheets or something and she was like asking me if it would go with her wallpaper and stuff and she was like the she was like discrubing it to me like i this has a green trim with like a flower is design and she is like do you think this is like blue will accent in or something and i am like yeah sure whatever i think 

Recording: (1272/ 2140) 
for the father less respect for the mother less respect for the grandparents and the great grandparents uh i would almost give you a first hand example uh i just had a uh conversation with one of my granddaughters who is now twenty uh she will come over to my house grandfather is house and she will come in and she will flop down in a chair uh and she will do nothing in that household even if you suggest it 

Recording: (1273/ 2140) 
it would be like go i mean that is an awfully small price to pay for 

Recording: (1274/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1275/ 2140) 
like uh right now their biggest campaign is uh the some elementary school i believe no i think it is a high school in marion we built on um an old weapons depot and so like leukemia is reason and so like that is their main campaign now is to informed the public and try and uh get that changed they have also done other things uh other uh did you anything dealing with the environment uh like exposure uh things like that so 

Recording: (1276/ 2140) 
it i i do not know how to tell you that um i mean it it is 

Recording: (1277/ 2140) 
in fact that that is always seen i felt difficult about about living there was they would be asking all these incredible questions and i would be trying to do the dishes or something money like that it is like i do not want to do the dishes i just want to answer the question 

Recording: (1278/ 2140) 
you know conscientious that there are 

Recording: (1279/ 2140) 
um somehow really yeah and if they if everybody would just begin to build that way and when they start to say something nasty i would think well i want them to say that to me 

Recording: (1280/ 2140) 
yeah yeah it was just like there is a lot of people there who you know like their parents were farmers and or they they were whatever you know it was like like peppy peppy kids or like heck you know if you guys kids you know 

Recording: (1281/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1282/ 2140) 
everybody needs to know that information 

Recording: (1283/ 2140) 
and go back and ask him as as as as i would ask uh my uh english teacher in school uh uh anybody uh said but what did this point uh what was his uh he wrote this form let me i gave my interpretation oh no no no that was not it uh they were sure they thought uh how you know that was is it he is been dead 

Recording: (1284/ 2140) 
you can not put a value on human life uh you know they are just subtle things that you know my sense of taste and smell was gone for about a year and a half uh just all the drama that goes involved with it not just not just the physical drama i mean that was enough to killed anybody but because of me because of my size because of my strength uh i was not killed you know um um 

Recording: (1285/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1286/ 2140) 
um 

Recording: (1287/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1288/ 2140) 
forte 

Recording: (1289/ 2140) 
oh 

Recording: (1290/ 2140)

Recording: (1291/ 2140) 
did she 

Recording: (1292/ 2140) 
connecting from wires across up here or something and they are uh so they become very distrustful of adults because all their life people have been saying 

Recording: (1293/ 2140) 
yeah well the white man would probably win but the black man also has a he has a better chance than the woman i think 

Recording: (1294/ 2140) 
um-hum yeah 

Recording: (1295/ 2140)

it was columbus he went to uh fort haze 

Recording: (1300/ 2140) 
well yeah 

Recording: (1301/ 2140) 
getting electrocuted or something yeah that just does not appeal to me too much but i mean it is really not too difficult i mean as long as you are careful and 

Recording: (1302/ 2140) 
yeah it it says 

Recording: (1303/ 2140) 
well like a mile yeah miles down to the south end or something like that but you just punch in your numbers always you just talk with numbers yeah

obviously it is not something new that is been coming around i mean it is i have been around for a long time 

Recording: (1313/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1314/ 2140) 
yeah that is it 

Recording: (1315/ 2140) 
um i helped them set up different things helped them you know clean them up afterwards prepations all kinds of different things there was a lot of blood and stuff i do not know when you when it is not you it seems a little easier to observe i guess when you see somebody you know it is a little more concerning to you i do not know but you see a lot of different stuff and you hope that the majority of it is helping this person out now my wife you know 

Recording: (1316/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1317/ 2140) 
and so they went up there but the germans caught on pretty quick and they made it pretty hot and that area of india was just flat as this table almost for an area back from the mid italian back probably ten miles there is ten or twelve months yeah long and the coast long and uh so we we had enough area to 

Recording: (1318/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1319/ 2140) 
imagine it and that is basically what happened her and her mom had three kids by three different dads and they thought if they could get her out of that environment they actually had they were moving in with them they were her temporary foster parents and she just turned sixteen so she was fifteen when she moved in with them she used to change and i do not know what could have changed it if they would have got around earlier but basically all three of them 

Recording: (1320/ 2140) 
i travel has been all i i even before the transition time i travel across the state and country and before that was always traveling we took two two weeks off when we go back to fall semester that time of semester is not quarters and uh uh we could on a anyhow bus for our past was and but then i would just travel all the country and sleep on the bus at night

um-hum 

Recording: (1330/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1331/ 2140)

Recording: (1332/ 2140) 
i have no problem with a man being with a man or woman being with a woman but uh if if that was the relationship for everybody 

Recording: (1333/ 2140) 
i feel like uh i have friends and when you say oh we are going out to the bar like we all know which bar because there is only one that college students go to and then so 

Recording: (1334/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1335/ 2140) 
they are usually going to get a lot of date 

Recording: (1336/ 2140)

yeah there is a there is a girl at the store i was talking to and uh she saw how i wrote my signature if you look right there sjustif i was a doctor 

Recording: (1338/ 2140) 
yeah yeah i i do not know but it then then they second guess the mother and she risked her life and i they they can not do that i mean you know it is too bad that you know she was not there to to go on with what they were planning on doing but it is not our right to to take other country is kids even i mean that is another thing i mean come to america we will take everyone and every you know but then we have all these this crime because we have all these terrorist people that come from i mean that is all they have grown up with 

Recording: (1339/ 2140) 
in high school yeah i had friends with most of them 

Recording: (1340/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1341/ 2140) 
did you get a tape everything i do not care if it is overtime or not it is on 

Recording: (1342/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1343/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1344/ 2140) 
middle 

Recording: (1345/ 2140) 
um at the same time my mother and my dad split up i was just about to start my second year at williams in high school so i am about to start my sophomore year and for the first time in something like three years i am at the school for two years and so i was like no i i just finally made friends there is no way i made friends they just finally succeeded in making um my father 

Recording: (1346/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1347/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1348/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1349/ 2140) 
you have spelled every name you have read every name you have written every name practically there are not any that you have not heard of 

Recording: (1350/ 2140) 
walk us all the ways through the hospital 

Recording: (1351/ 2140) 
it just just kind of instincts i guess yeah actually there are quite a there is a a a well pretty well known doctor that has a ton of books and i go to the late day league and that is kind of their philosophy in a way yeah just that breast feeding is you know a way to mother and 

Recording: (1352/ 2140) 
um 

Recording: (1353/ 2140) 
yeah it is kind of fun 

Recording: (1354/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1355/ 2140) 
i would not have been smiling from down there that up here when he dropped me off but he did not even know 

Recording: (1356/ 2140) 
williams freshman year and ever single one of them was accurate it was really really really funny williams lose something expensive by the end of the year and i had my bike do not want will william will uh and the big one that i was going to mention was william will either grow in his face significantly or will go the exact opposite direction and i knew one or i thought what happened because on the type i mean my roommate my freshman year for the first quarter was a drug dealer oh 

Recording: (1357/ 2140) 
well i agree that we should help them maybe through some sort of government program but i think what really hurts them the most is the people that actually give them the money in high street because it really does not motivate them to get out of the gutter i mean if they can make a living off of begging change off of college students they are probably going to stay because it is really easy life 

Recording: (1358/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1359/ 2140) 
not on airplanes but on in calling systems 

Recording: (1360/ 2140) 
it is a lot of the it looks uh looking feel is a lot a lot the same 

Recording: (1361/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1362/ 2140) 
and then how so as far as that to them when you have a chance to talk to them that is where we need to learn more from interview have more meaningful interviews with these people so but we can learn from them they put them on spot light but we somehow we do still wanna uh i guess flood them up the we do not want to get the negative answer because oh my image of the university oh gee now who was it catson mower or something like that 

Recording: (1363/ 2140) 
and uh they are very into capitalism and their lives are working pretty good for them so 

Recording: (1364/ 2140)

Recording: (1365/ 2140) 
anything else is a hardware failure and you have to go fix it somewhere else anyway so if you know how to put out an operating system on your machine you can start over if you can start over there is no reason to be scared of anything that you do probably remember one in playing with computers for most people as being afraid that they are going to break something 

Recording: (1366/ 2140) 
true um um and the air that is both fun and brief okay so um my friend chrison irupsters playing on the computer and um my sister is down there she is watching television it sunday morning and um i am trying to figure out how this game works trying to figure out how this game works and then i said i i have got some information on this game out in the car i am going to go get it 

Recording: (1367/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1368/ 2140) 
you know there is things about my dad but and i were in a little of a with and and he i used to great and he is wonderful to me i mean my dad is really wonderful to me but i mean things like like what my mom had me he he did not pick her up from the hospital i mean it is that kind of stuff that you think what the hell were you thinking 

Recording: (1369/ 2140) 
such such an idea uh and that indeed is going to take away from family i can not in my way of thinking i can not imagine that i would uh have my wife producing somebody else is child over here and i am going to have the same thank you that is exactly fatherly love fatherly value fatherly instincts toward 

Recording: (1370/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1371/ 2140) 
exactly huge 

Recording: (1372/ 2140) 
hum 

Recording: (1373/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1374/ 2140) 
i do not know about it but they were very good

uh-huh 

Recording: (1376/ 2140) 
and we would uh adjust the guns called down shifts till they could come within reasonable close to that 

Recording: (1377/ 2140)

Recording: (1378/ 2140) 
so 

Recording: (1379/ 2140) 
uh well the problem is is uh like say every airline wants to go to new york city and they want all their businessmen there at eight a m well an airport has so many runways and so many tax you ways and you know like say ten airplanes every ten minutes can come in and out of those airports well they end up shooting like thirty there so instead of letting them all get in the air and stand up there at hold while they are you know shooting them in what they do is that 

Recording: (1380/ 2140) 
i am all of them the university is divided up in different areas and there is a shop within each area that takes care of all the maintenance needs for those areas usually there they are about twenty buildings or so ours is in the northeast area from western there down through the ocean to oh i do not know about uh durby or so around in there and then on over to woodrow 

Recording: (1381/ 2140) 
oh yeah there is always people out there 

Recording: (1382/ 2140) 
um i i took a class for more processing more more processing one too i took those and um i tell you what i can not remember is they taught me how to balance a checkbook out 

Recording: (1383/ 2140) 
yeah i i thought in the beginning i missed mary lake cafe is so bad you have the good subs and all that i do not i do not know why i missed them i do not i go back and i just do not like it anymore 

Recording: (1384/ 2140) 
um it is pretty dangerous drug i would say for the most part um not so much they are getting high part of it but just what goes into it 

Recording: (1385/ 2140) 
hum 

Recording: (1386/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1387/ 2140) 
there is very definitely 

Recording: (1388/ 2140) 
you know with the computer and everything um he is uh he is a really good handyman he can do anything so he is really helped me he he is really into design and stuff so he likes to paint and um you know he is really open he is learned a lot about gardening for me and you know that is one of my main things is gardening and yeah 

Recording: (1389/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1390/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1391/ 2140) 
um-hum um-hum 

Recording: (1392/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1393/ 2140) 
yeah exactly so you know once you once you get to a certain degree of uh frustration and you need to relieve that somehow so that is pretty much why we moved 

Recording: (1394/ 2140) 
really 

Recording: (1395/ 2140) 
from our friends that have gone yeah what is their discipline is expiling child from school well they are expiling them to a home where the parents working where they are just getting three days a free play i mean pretty much to get in trouble and cause more trouble they really are not learning from that 

Recording: (1396/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (1397/ 2140) 
well yeah i think it is real important to really good get a good uh feel for how you are and all your beliefs and all that they have to really match and um um and if they do not um then it is not ever going to work because there is always going to be conflict and friction and all that kind of thing so i think it is real important and there is no age limit on that to when you really feel good about yourself when you really know what you want to do then that is the only time that you can really commit and say yeah we 

Recording: (1398/ 2140) 
yeah i think basically normal hours would be like eight to twelve and then you go home during lunchtime because that is the big meal of day you go home and eat with your family that is really important 

Recording: (1399/ 2140) 
on sunday 

Recording: (1400/ 2140) 
i have not i know until they had so many beaches i mean i know they had a good reputation you know for for like just just you know just having a great vacation time because nobody ever came back from a hundred dollars yeah the place is terrible you know when the weather was bad you know that that people are people were rude and everybody is are there just said oh you got to go you got to go you know it is a long five that is well what the time time 

Recording: (1401/ 2140) 
uh i think they lost i think ohio state lost because they is just out there raining and reeling and after a while got out of hand not 

Recording: (1402/ 2140) 
well that is probably the rough right there 

Recording: (1403/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1404/ 2140) 
she is very bright she is very she comes from an extremely dysfunctional family her uh parents divorced when she was about four her mother is now alcohol like her father said that he would take her with him and then after he got divorced he changed his mind so she is pretty much raised herself it it is a big it it is terrible thing is what she is had to go through and she is made it very clear that she will not live with an alcoholic and that is helped straighten him out some and our feeling was never that the alcoholism or 

Recording: (1405/ 2140) 
so i think 

Recording: (1406/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (1407/ 2140) 
i think that basically that is it and the nut shows they have reached a point in their life where you know their their cow is as far as going out and killing themselves but they want to kill themselves slowly by humum themselves to death or uh smoking you know whatever you know smoking uhprocrack or whatever and uh and they just living in the hell i mean 

Recording: (1408/ 2140) 
um early admissions halfway 

Recording: (1409/ 2140) 
no 

Recording: (1410/ 2140) 
do not need to work that many hours with that 

Recording: (1411/ 2140) 
and you did not even have your violence and stuff like that i have never heard you know i am just using pop right now 

Recording: (1412/ 2140) 
much more widely used once you get into college um but i mean as far as like the pot and just things like that i mean i can not say i see any difference between 

Recording: (1413/ 2140) 
uh-huh it does 

Recording: (1414/ 2140) 
um probably for the most part i mean as long as they have a political background or something sort of i can not say see any real difference i mean for the most part they have would not be able to do anything else any guy can do so 

Recording: (1415/ 2140) 
that is always really right uh-huh really but there is a lot of other ones in garland uh why 

Recording: (1416/ 2140) 
hardly at all which uh you know it is actually my family is business so um i started working there to help them out but you know as i have been working there for a while i want to move up you know so 

Recording: (1417/ 2140) 
the herbs the herbs 

Recording: (1418/ 2140) 
i do not think we take up a huge amount and then uh we get some of the service through ornett as well which is i think it is just up in plano and they give us a do not make yeah 

Recording: (1419/ 2140) 
um sort of like make their own decision when they got older what they wanted to do what they wanted to go with it 

Recording: (1420/ 2140) 
you know 

Recording: (1421/ 2140) 
but he is also like i said he is got five kids they live in low income housing they are collecting welfare 

Recording: (1422/ 2140) 
when i threatened to take them to court and it took almost two months after that 

Recording: (1423/ 2140) 
because now they are getting to the age where they are fighting more and you know and you got a boy and a girl and you know it is 

Recording: (1424/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1425/ 2140) 
but then uh it is like that some evil person back there in the screening room puts some of this junk in there right in the middle and then you go you can not stop and not watch that and if i was in church of it i would cut some of it out it is not that important 

Recording: (1426/ 2140) 
it was not so much of a hate thing it was just more easier to people i like to hang out with if you do not like to that is fine 

Recording: (1427/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1428/ 2140) 
right and i think that you know i think that just because you know you do so because i know i have done studies and i took some of those classes and you just think about it that way and i think a lot of these people just you know they say the nurse has sent me to take everything for a fact and i thought that was kind of strange but i mean i think there is a lot of things that are probably positive enough about it that i would want to do it for for a as long as i could 

Recording: (1429/ 2140) 
thirty nine 

Recording: (1430/ 2140) 
i said this will never work i am not interested to take it back and he said no no no just let us just work with it just work with us we will we will take care of it so i ended up down to him for a hundred and forty four but it was just funny because i thought i thought they are never going to get to where i have to be and we are not even going to play this game back and forth 

Recording: (1431/ 2140) 
around more than somebody else 

Recording: (1432/ 2140) 
got bears 

Recording: (1433/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1434/ 2140) 
yeah yeah i applied for it and went after it aggressively 

Recording: (1435/ 2140) 
and i am not quite sure how to address that because in a in is and some people would say now wait a minute you are talking out of both sides of your mouth the expression is how can you say over here you must have the love of this child in your arms and and then over here you are saying you are believing capital punishment and electrocution 

Recording: (1436/ 2140) 
do not pay 

Recording: (1437/ 2140) 
i had high potential when i had the first two and then uh the last two i had now i got cardiovascular disease i still got one of murderers about eighty percent blocked i got another one fifty percent block and i got a dead spot on my heart right now so when i exercise uh my heart slows down let us put it this way where i work at i work here at osu yeah well 

Recording: (1438/ 2140) 
uh one of my friends who had the apartment in arlington 

Recording: (1439/ 2140) 
uh about fifteen minutes my mom and i do not go too far from each other so but jameson is going to take the week off and everything so i think that we will we will be able to do that 

Recording: (1440/ 2140) 
yeah and because i back when i was in high school in my ap government class i was paying attention a lot you know like i read the columbus about every day and i read us news and world report for my economics class and i was totally caught up with everything 

Recording: (1441/ 2140) 
oh yeah and i i will probably step on your toes here but i i i am not a firm believer of mom and dad both working i my wife worked until we had children then she stayed home and once they got into school she worked at a school so when they were gone she was gone when they were home she was at home and you know my parents did not do that and i hated it i hated coming home from school by myself every day there was nobody there to talk to you know and i did it for years and and i just feel that you know i i hope you do not have children yet do you 

Recording: (1442/ 2140) 
vote with the candidate who is going to put the best justices on the supreme court and i got a lot of people to vote for clinton that way both in ninety two and again and for your ninety six uh and i think that is going to happen again because the the candidates and i am telling you my politics here are very clearly and early but the candidates have pretty well spoken on that issue already i know which one will protect the right for choice uh and um i i think 

Recording: (1443/ 2140) 
you know mixed race or or handicapped or you know hard to place 

Recording: (1444/ 2140) 
right there is a lot of uh money money in town here and there is sometimes like you will see a uh one entire airplane that goes to cancun and it is like people are going vacation or people are going to go gambling and jamaica that is all it is so then when that comes in we have these really weird painted airplanes and we are like who is that 

Recording: (1445/ 2140) 
i forget the name well i do not think there is a university of portland but there is two two or yes there is a university i can not think of which one it is right now speaking of opinions did you see the paper today about the thing in seattle they are having this speaking 

Recording: (1446/ 2140) 
no i mean 

Recording: (1447/ 2140) 
but uh she likes the spiritual of the community over there and 

Recording: (1448/ 2140) 
oh 

Recording: (1449/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1450/ 2140) 
and she says it is amazing you can give these give people numbers and they immediately use them wrong they just do not know how to use them uh they completely misinterperty even though it is very clearly stated what they are doing and uh the newspapers do that a lot too 

Recording: (1451/ 2140) 
um one of my best friends from high school and my boyfriend are both in it and they have bugged me about it forever to come and like oh i do not know about computers so they took me finally like december or something 

Recording: (1452/ 2140) 
it is a good place they even stop playing the ghetto music this is juke box and it was horrible it played the same three songs with like horrible offensive lyrics and no melody so ever 

Recording: (1453/ 2140) 
he is seven months yep he is climbing on stuff and everything 

Recording: (1454/ 2140) 
basically because you know the open shelter i do not know whether you have ever been around there but it is not a pretty site you know 

Recording: (1455/ 2140) 
um working on three different um research projects with three different physicians to are um specific to the traumatic brain injury service looking at long term out comes and people that that has the same traumatic brain injuries the other one is a drug study um looking at control of agitation and the other one is a um spinal injury research study 

Recording: (1456/ 2140) 
i feel like i should just stand out there give it money because my bills are getting me high 

Recording: (1457/ 2140) 
yeah it is a lot smaller than columbus though 

Recording: (1458/ 2140) 
his speed was like say seventy miles an hour before and now it is going to be twenty because he does not know how to do it and that is the problem they are running into they have all these qualified people who know how to separate airplanes and how to get them in trail and you know everything but now they have got to do this extra part which is going to make their job easier down the road but everybody hates change so what they are doing now is it they are having problems because people can not take the volume of airplanes because they are trying to keep up with the computer so it is making it even slower 

Recording: (1459/ 2140) 
medication of his own free will that was his responsibility to take the medicine every day just like it is mine take mine every day and when i stopped taking mine that was my possibly which is why i do not want to go to the legal system to try and make an excuse even though there is uh there is uh some law that six people that if they were drunk or on influence of medication or or off the influence of medication um in case 

Recording: (1460/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1461/ 2140) 
and he needed that but if 

Recording: (1462/ 2140) 
um-hum do you have that three people in fall quarters three people in spring quarter 

Recording: (1463/ 2140) 
you were passed yeah 

Recording: (1464/ 2140) 
no i do not think it was because i grew up just basic not even really christian just really not no real religion and i had been going to a presbyterian church as i was about nineteen years old looking for something a church i just had a feeling that i wanted to have that in my life because i never had that before and so i was just looking around and i was open to anything i would listen to 

Recording: (1465/ 2140) 
nobody around not but land 

Recording: (1466/ 2140) 
is it 

Recording: (1467/ 2140) 
well they pretty much put by the test scores they do not sit you down like in private schools they do this they sit you down one to one just like we are and they spend probably you know maybe twenty thirty minutes a day actually getting another student what the student still needs for the complete and that grade and once they figure that you are able to go there then up you go right up the ladder 

Recording: (1468/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1469/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1470/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1471/ 2140) 
right um at the age that they were 

Recording: (1472/ 2140) 
i am bouncing around too much 

Recording: (1473/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1474/ 2140) 
yeah you it then uh i you know i have just come to i always you know prefer for my children than myself i mean uh if there is anything disney i usually go and watch it you know at the movie theater and after a while it is like i think beauty and the beast is where it really came through to me as like that is the wonderful story but do they have to have all that killing and so on in the middle right in the middle of it 

Recording: (1475/ 2140) 
and then of the community fan out and they have a bigger house i like living in the old area better i like the houses and the new ones better there is one in particular that is just gorgeous 

Recording: (1476/ 2140)

Recording: (1477/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1478/ 2140) 
yeah it is 

Recording: (1479/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1480/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1481/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1482/ 2140) 
uh plea bargained or 

Recording: (1483/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1484/ 2140) 
um-hum i am sure somewhere i am sure somewhere along the line they would work things out to try to help her over those bums it would not be long term and they would know that it would not be long term but that is that 

Recording: (1485/ 2140) 
she goes well you had dad dukakis money i said oh lord 

Recording: (1486/ 2140) 
yeah that is i mean that is really a tough one uh because it is i think people are looking for easy answers and there is no easy answer uh and i do not think it is violence on tv i do not think it is working parents i think it is and i do not know what it is it seems to be something more pervasive than could be disely um i i i do not know it is it is often and i mean your daughter is there is daughters yeah 

Recording: (1487/ 2140) 
huh 

Recording: (1488/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (1489/ 2140) 
i moved to louisville kentucky 

Recording: (1490/ 2140) 
um but yeah i do not know yeah i think it is like there is like a real like either or it is it is old people are there retiring or whatever and where it is uh more of like a younger people there i do not know you do not see a lot i do not know there is middle age people there but it is not so apparent like just here i guess 

Recording: (1491/ 2140) 
you can get into catch twenty two because of legislation and i mean you can not require i do not see how you can require a a a guy who buys a gun to buy a a lock and then buy a safe for the for the guns and and and do all that stuff because that in case where burglar comes into your house which is why why you have a gun anyway you have some fear of something like that happening otherwise you should not have one unless you are a sportsman and uh then you know you are it is not going to be worth it to have 

Recording: (1492/ 2140) 
yeah like like five hundred people in a lecture hall yeah 

Recording: (1493/ 2140) 
in the march i do not have a plane ticket yeah i have a year old passbook 

Recording: (1494/ 2140)

throwed it 

Recording: (1496/ 2140) 
oh my gosh 

Recording: (1497/ 2140) 
that in just twenty years and possibly ten each and every one of us in the world are going to be intercon but once again it is an impersonal uh interconnexion i will be able to contact you when you are over in paris and i will be over in in ogdo on out to our own farm and i have probably watched in the geese swimming up and down to the little lake and you are sitting over there and paris having a uh 

Recording: (1498/ 2140) 
i think i am i am perfectly good that 

Recording: (1499/ 2140) 
um i do not know if you could say that it there were a lot of problems i mean i even have problems like on the school bus and stuff you know but i have black friends so uh i did not have much you know much problems 

Recording: (1500/ 2140) 
i she is always trying to recruit people to come and visit but it is i can two hour drive and then everybody is busy you know that is four hours of driving and um i do not know it is just too hard to keep everybody in touch that way but 

Recording: (1501/ 2140) 
town with the 

Recording: (1502/ 2140) 
well clowncon is not there clowncon i you could get like a bag of um two of the rolls and pay only five cents so um that is gone and um that was a kid thing um my grandfather used to own in a men market 

Recording: (1503/ 2140) 
he thought it was great that i was going to school but 

Recording: (1504/ 2140) 
yeah after you learn to know her 

Recording: (1505/ 2140) 
you know 

Recording: (1506/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1507/ 2140) 
and 

Recording: (1508/ 2140) 
uh it is i mean it is a lot better than it was even a year ago 

Recording: (1509/ 2140) 
well no actually my mom did not she was a very bad cook 

Recording: (1510/ 2140) 
yeah it was a homemade bow and arrow 

Recording: (1511/ 2140) 
the majority of the ones that do not get the guides at home that you are trying to reaching on go to boy scouts 

Recording: (1512/ 2140) 
right yeah 

Recording: (1513/ 2140) 
try and feed eight children and if you are here in this country and eight children why do you have eight children to start with 

Recording: (1514/ 2140) 
yeah and and the problem is uh the problem is seeing things in other people i mean actually seeing spirit in other people in terms of someone said the eyes are the mirror to the wall is very true you know i can see in certain people is eyes when i was in the hospital the confusion the unsure feelings 

Recording: (1515/ 2140) 
does not that get back more or less to the thing about everybody being me me me now and therefore they are really doing so much care about where they came from and what they are and who they are 

Recording: (1516/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1517/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1518/ 2140) 
really 

Recording: (1519/ 2140) 
oh and it is a yes it is it is a catholic school environment so it will be interesting to see what evolve from the children is uh attention to to the the roman catholic side of religion as compared to the baptist so 

Recording: (1520/ 2140) 
right and then they wonder why uh you know uh i do not know what is happened it is the other person who is changed you know and if you if you start changing your behavior you can usually get the kinds of changes i always figure if you treat people the way they will go the real thing do you if you give out what you want back you get it 

Recording: (1521/ 2140) 
orwell i i talked to this one guy he was he was in the abc all and he did like a couple tours in vietnam and he was he was talking about how he was he was drunk and he was he was from alabama yeah i am about half drunk now so i am trying to figure out where his model number is and like you know i talked to him for like fifteen minutes 

Recording: (1522/ 2140) 
i think that is great you know i think obviously there is always a down side and but i think that too many people abuse the system and you know unfortunately it is very hard when you know then it ruins it for the people who really do need it and but you know as long as they 

Recording: (1523/ 2140) 
like it is okay i mean it is like a country school which was always real weird too i was always like i mean like my friends were always like the because they used to have real long hair and so that was like i used to be like a big hippie or ever and like um that was i guess weird kind of like being the odd people and in a small in a small midwestern far mean the school is kind of odd i guess um um 

Recording: (1524/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1525/ 2140) 
as much as she could yeah we were poor but we managed 

Recording: (1526/ 2140) 
now people like that can not work when i was a kid your family took care of you there was not welfare and stuff like this but you do not have a family structure no more 

Recording: (1527/ 2140) 
when you think that our major resource is is our children in our off spring then we better not you know 

Recording: (1528/ 2140) 
since an hour at the beverly across the street on the el avenue so um uh but but anyhow you know they could never understand you know he did not he never got a job with it you know why would you go to school and waste all that money i even spent this money i ever spent 

Recording: (1529/ 2140) 
yeah we used going up there to i can not really remember you know it is been twenty years ago and i just you know i do not have any real recollection 

Recording: (1530/ 2140) 
nope huhuh 

Recording: (1531/ 2140) 
and if i was in the same situation i would be doing the same thing so 

Recording: (1532/ 2140) 
wow you yeah i know 

Recording: (1533/ 2140) 
appeals appeals 

Recording: (1534/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1535/ 2140) 
time it was in high school and college and all this kind of thing but it was just like you know people just thought oh you are american you are here therefore you must have lots of extra money to throw around and and you know they just sort of do not grasp the fact that you know you can have made sacrifices to be there but i do think also in films you know i remember actually being in bristol and that film california with brad pet and julete lewis and you know they are in the trailer and everything else 

Recording: (1536/ 2140) 
and we now run of the grigorian and uh that sort of thing but back to your question i think you were asking are 

Recording: (1537/ 2140) 
i am actually like a month older than 

Recording: (1538/ 2140) 
but he would bring in a nutritionist or whatever to explain to the parents blah blah blah 

Recording: (1539/ 2140) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (1540/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1541/ 2140) 
yes you are you are saying you do not need to have a leader in the family and if i am going to be a leader i am going to be the one i am going to be the one not the spring back oh you came from this little tube here oh okay that that is the principal effect no i have to be because there is no father here well 

Recording: (1542/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1543/ 2140) 
the uh technical systems and policy end of it and hated it the other years were fine but those last three uh 

Recording: (1544/ 2140) 
my gosh it is one of those that i like you know falling out of trees 

Recording: (1545/ 2140) 
um i talk to them every now and then 

Recording: (1546/ 2140) 
i mean carrying cabinets and he will do it as long as you are paying him he will do it 

Recording: (1547/ 2140) 
i am i am not built that way 

Recording: (1548/ 2140) 
well i do think access is too easy but it is sort of like anything else i think if laws were passed the people who were against it would be so you know just besides themselves but it would i do not know for how long but i think it would make the situation not with the shootings and things like that but i think it would make the just the gun situation probably much worse for a while because people would be you know doing illegal things to get guns and that 

Recording: (1549/ 2140) 
just does that into being sure you are relaxed enough 

Recording: (1550/ 2140) 
but i do not see it as negatives affecting me i still get all this stuff done i need to get done 

Recording: (1551/ 2140) 
do in their eleventh and do in the twelfth you can take them as many times as you need to take them but if you do not pass them all by the time you graduate you get this nifty little thing called an attendant certificate it is not a real diploma it is like okay i attended i did not learn anything but i was there 

Recording: (1552/ 2140) 
yeah um i took one oh four during winter quarter 

Recording: (1553/ 2140) 
it was really great i mean it is just nice laid back country setting and you do not have to worry about that much crime while your horse might get taken in not yet but i do not have any horses 

Recording: (1554/ 2140) 
better sign long as 

Recording: (1555/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1556/ 2140) 
well he is two main uh main characters in his cartoon and for willie and joe 

Recording: (1557/ 2140) 
no what 

Recording: (1558/ 2140) 
oh sure 

Recording: (1559/ 2140) 
but it it is teaching him discipline responsibility you can not do these things at this time you know i 

Recording: (1560/ 2140) 
no it was predomin it was more black than white tell you truth or it might have been even but now it is more black than white definitely now because i i they live in a neighborhood where it is where not it is mostly black then white and that is where i have always lived in my whole life 

Recording: (1561/ 2140) 
humum she had kind of a hard time in high school she was uh raped by a teacher in ninth grade when she first went into a school and from there it is just been a nightmare of what how that it is affected her you know anything she goes through you blame it on that or you go back i could say oh i wonder you know if she was like that because of this and you know so that is been a real struggle in high school i was i never really 

Recording: (1562/ 2140) 
i mean if i would have chosen to do that well that is my choice um you and your husband is like what do you think you should teach maybe not sex specifically but just like general rules for good living if your church is saying one thing but realistically you think maybe something a little bit different but when you how do you think this is all that conflict um 

Recording: (1563/ 2140) 
and you know people do not have big families like they used to you know so 

Recording: (1564/ 2140) 
uh three years something like that hard to remember a long time ago 

Recording: (1565/ 2140) 
i 

Recording: (1566/ 2140) 
yeah yeah yeah 

Recording: (1567/ 2140) 
i never heard a thing about it all the time i was in the service 

Recording: (1568/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1569/ 2140) 
uh it is not a presidential issue candidate issue as far as i am concerned but uh i am 

Recording: (1570/ 2140) 
so it is probably was not unexpected we just were not prepared for it i do not think you could be prepared for it 

Recording: (1571/ 2140) 
so but i had some really tough challenging jobs and yeah if i knew now what i knew then i probably could be a million or without the lawsuits of different yeah experiences um sexual harassment 

Recording: (1572/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1573/ 2140) 
and they were in italy and europe and uh there was not the definite enemy in vietnam that there was in europe i think that is part of it and of course the attitude of most of the yeah i used to went to vietnam was a little bit different from right probably as a consequence of or understanding of the the uh 

Recording: (1574/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1575/ 2140) 
yeah i uh well and that was really um struggle you know a struggle for money and everything so i would take whatever would come along and when you work in secure jobs like that i mean you i had a different job every year i mean a year would come up and i would say okay here we go you know they are either going to down size or they are going to do something and they always so i was never really shocked and i did not panick or anything and i was never without a job i never had to i never missed um you know i would say 

Recording: (1576/ 2140) 
we took um or i took uh military athletics as a philosophy course and that was really interesting because even though in even in that iraqi there is still certain contacts within the contacts of war for instance if if we both know if we knowingly go into it as combatants and we are fighting for whatever it costs but if we both are willingness going into it 

Recording: (1577/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1578/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1579/ 2140) 
have the money behind them they have lawyers behind them so they can sue for an appeal 

Recording: (1580/ 2140) 
when they drove by i 

Recording: (1581/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1582/ 2140) 
uh 

Recording: (1583/ 2140) 
i went back and did a one year um schooling to get my nursing license i became an elfian so i do not have a degree my husband has a degree i put him through school i finished finished his private school 

Recording: (1584/ 2140) 
and that is what i am saying a tone and for sin it is quite a hypocracy when you get a church telling you that you need to ask for forgiveness when what they did i mean in the church in zanesville where i went and buried my grandparents and went to all my life over the door the church is a picture of christopher columbus with a missionary a priest and all his men with his sore drawn a dead native american and his feet and three more at the side looking on and fair now 

Recording: (1585/ 2140) 
got to pull if you got to pull table over on the hall i will show you it is kind of 

Recording: (1586/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1587/ 2140) 
kind of exciting because you are getting in on things that are really new and trying to master the project i am working on now um it is trying to find a way to to to create data that describes web resources so the libraries can take this data and put it in a catalog and then agree it with a regular collection and we are doing a lot of with that yeah it is it is pretty it is a pretty neat project a lot of new things the uh job in the web give us opportunities to do things 

Recording: (1588/ 2140) 
and decided to pursue the matter to the extent of marriage so that is where they meant no huhuh i i would come down here two or three times like you know just trips through going to the airport and other miscellaneous things but um when i moved to the city i mean it it was a real big change because i you know used to live in the country and i moved into a smack avenue in the middle of a downtown area 

Recording: (1589/ 2140) 
oh really that is cute 

Recording: (1590/ 2140) 
uh 

Recording: (1591/ 2140) 
see i do not shut up so i would talk to them the whole time and so they would always be really verbal and so it would seem like they had a much better understanding and could do things better than they really could like when my daughter was about five we got a hamster and i said well you know you make sure you give up food and water and when it died and i was so surprised that she she had not given and been giving it food and water because she did it occasionally but to a five year old you do not yeah they do not get that stuff together or when she was eleven we sold her 

Recording: (1592/ 2140) 
uh that is why okay 

Recording: (1593/ 2140) 
motherly instinct towards you know oh now like oh eric you should have one and you know and he knows i am like that one um i just knew at a young age i have always loved the animals 

Recording: (1594/ 2140) 
uh yeah so i think she is getting a better education than he did not but it is because she is doing the work and she knows she is expected to as to and he my son is the kind he would rather play than work and so he he wrote a lot and 

Recording: (1595/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1596/ 2140) 
this is a different time now uh i mean i remember uh one of the things i saw when i was a kid on a newscast you know with uh uh the vietnamese guy uh vietnam guy getting his brain blown out on national tv you know and uh uh that did not make me go out what do that you know so if anything it made me want to not want to do it you know because my brother was in was in vietnam he was in the army 

Recording: (1597/ 2140) 
much in school is that 

Recording: (1598/ 2140) 
it is right on their main street and they have gorgeous really neat unique things 

Recording: (1599/ 2140) 
that is it oh 

Recording: (1600/ 2140) 
with six normal kids because ld kids would be creative and they would think of ways to get out of there and the normal kids would sit and cry 

Recording: (1601/ 2140) 
so i ended up doing that for about three months and ended up plunking out of uh ou in the in the first three months of the first quarter so uh then i get my notice in january so 

Recording: (1602/ 2140) 
you do not slide as much 

Recording: (1603/ 2140) 
she was a cowboy and he was an indian 

Recording: (1604/ 2140) 
now that i do not make any extra work for the teacher but it gives him a shot he usually will answer the concept he will usually answer the and stuff that he knows and if you only grade him on that he might have a shot at a sierra be i mean there is all kind of ways to modify uh give a he does work them out uh give a kid a copy of another student is notes if his are crummy and he can not study from them we even have a thing at our school that it is 

Recording: (1605/ 2140) 
true 

Recording: (1606/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1607/ 2140) 
for example so you should name her camer 

Recording: (1608/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (1609/ 2140) 
i do not know what it is like to grow up in anywhere else i i know what it is like uh kind of like where my cousin lived in new york because i would go there in the um uh how do you judge that you know what do you compare that to 

Recording: (1610/ 2140) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (1611/ 2140) 
really they are they are the biggest asimov 

Recording: (1612/ 2140) 
uh i think when i was five because it was like yeah yeah i do not remember them being really together 

Recording: (1613/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1614/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1615/ 2140) 
so i tighten this good cool perfect 

Recording: (1616/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1617/ 2140) 
well also too when is the last time you seen a baseball game kids playing a baseball game in a neighborhood 

Recording: (1618/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1619/ 2140) 
oh they are helping out the the new guys 

Recording: (1620/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1621/ 2140) 
yeah i guess they do i do not know what where where it is or how many they have 

Recording: (1622/ 2140) 
you know they are going to most likely raise it up to twenty one since all these uh the kentucky and maryland color plano all those school shootings and can not believe i mean i mean there is articles in there you would not even believe if you have not read them 

Recording: (1623/ 2140) 
that is where you need to start you can not just say hey we got a snuck out of here we can screw him that is the problem and you are saying does it does it does it take home does it take church it takes moreals and that is why i was telling you before we got away from morals in our society we could care less about you i always said a a good successful salesman would be able to sell his own mother i mean so is own mother on the on the market 

Recording: (1624/ 2140) 
you know 

Recording: (1625/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1626/ 2140) 
i do not have a good opinion of uh columbus schools at all no not at all 

Recording: (1627/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1628/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1629/ 2140) 
of the puzzle that that helps i think matthew shepton helped also 

Recording: (1630/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1631/ 2140) 
because the problem with guns in my opinion is you do not have to think to use it it takes you know you do not have to sit there and load it and and a split second i think we all are capable of shooting somebody for whatever reason you know just stupidity or whatnot just in a split second you know we we might have that once in life but we can kill somebody that quickly and you can not go out you know 

Recording: (1632/ 2140) 
a retired uh i would like to move like to mountexterlin or something like that 

Recording: (1633/ 2140) 
should be tried and hopefully convicted on the facts and should not have anything else added into it i i think doing that is going to do the same thing that the many the civil rights and the uh affirmative action programs and the busting did that people is going to turn people against uh gays like that turn people against for a while although ultimately i think it did make a difference i i had a i have a black friend at the ohio education association was very active in the sixties 

Recording: (1634/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1635/ 2140) 
yeah probably have to go to double under you know worthington somewhere around there to find couple millionaers but uh 

Recording: (1636/ 2140) 
you know 

Recording: (1637/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1638/ 2140) 
it is just major thing that you have to do that are a lot more time consuming 

Recording: (1639/ 2140) 
do 

Recording: (1640/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1641/ 2140) 
i figure that will be plenty of fun if you had to one of them i just want green jello he did not make me snack so 

Recording: (1642/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1643/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1644/ 2140) 
it is an island but it planned it together i liked it there i kind of like i i figure they will probably hook up but i do not like how the show the show and this happened with deep space nine too and even with next generation for a little bit how the shows become soap opera like um i mean the romantic aspect of the stories do not really appealed to me very much uh i am more interested in the social things and you know good old special effects um but uh yeah 

Recording: (1645/ 2140) 
oh that is right 

Recording: (1646/ 2140) 
but she was never interested in never really interested in boys or in sports in high school or makeup clothes and things like that you you know you are saying for ridiculous when high school for that and that is what happens she would come home and tear because kids made fun of her and stuff and finally she just stopped going in within a couple months she a hundred gd 

Recording: (1647/ 2140) 
and i do have a brother 

Recording: (1648/ 2140) 
no then you would not be too familiar with everything 

Recording: (1649/ 2140) 
gotten somewhere else 

Recording: (1650/ 2140) 
nope 

Recording: (1651/ 2140) 
to uh you know to art whatever it is wherever it comes from and there is not the uh you know there is not the the old boy network you know not as not as much who you know to get into things uh or or that women are allowed to know that people that the boys know so it is not it is not as closed off that way 

Recording: (1652/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (1653/ 2140) 
it was it was supposedly it was my job but as you know the parents always get stuck i have a brother 

Recording: (1654/ 2140) 
proops yeah and it is like what is the difference you know besides the price 

Recording: (1655/ 2140) 
i really did not because i felt like i was in love with these boys yeah 

Recording: (1656/ 2140) 
crime 

Recording: (1657/ 2140) 
i do not think i did not i did not use to wrote or something like that 

Recording: (1658/ 2140) 
most of them are still suddenly just sitting there following my directions but they are getting better 

Recording: (1659/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1660/ 2140) 
you know and when he can wrestle with them and all that right now he is just he sits there and when he cries he goes what is he want like i know go down the list time okay just wait for if he it is been three hours since he is had a bottle give him a bottle you know 

Recording: (1661/ 2140) 
okay so yes in my opinion definitely it is eroding i know you took a little different approach in answering the question uh from over the time that that this kind of thing is eroding based upon the word respect not ever been to fall off so far uh yeah so yeah well oh well i will give you any that anyway if if i told them they could not do it i would trial that is where it is one of my that house and i know that uh i would try very very hard i got twelve years old and i better watch a little more care for my own age real did catch me doing something i had to tell him no you can not do i would apologize to him mom he was bad and mom he did that i have to have a mouth um-hum well well no no i mean now i go near the store to find things to be able to see why i will sit here this pie i will be telling them the cherry pie or uh-huh um-hum i guess that is uh i mean that is their problem or ours oh 

Recording: (1662/ 2140) 
it is a traffic jam and i am not moving as i am 

Recording: (1663/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1664/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1665/ 2140) 
veringham alabama 

Recording: (1666/ 2140) 
so i am sure that probably creates the right in public schools for 

Recording: (1667/ 2140) 
because i guess it all came together because i do not understand how people can let their kids be hurt but 

Recording: (1668/ 2140) 
no 

Recording: (1669/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1670/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1671/ 2140) 
yeah like like sort of i mean with like mp three is and stuff and people do a lot of that but it is it is i do not know i do not know i i do not really go on the internet a lot much like 

Recording: (1672/ 2140) 
oh yeah yeah we all get together we have to get a shelter house now somewhere because the nobody is house is big enough well and then we have so many little kids that it is great because uh we we just go to a shelter inside and they have it you know like for christmas and things like that and they can run around the kids run around and 

Recording: (1673/ 2140) 
um-hum um-hum but i do not know if that is i think that the divorce rate has gone up because it is more socially acceptable i am sure there is plenty of people twenty years ago that would have loved to have got a divorce how would that been an option um i i think it just i think a lot of it just depends on the way you handle it you know how you how you handle it after after the divorce is final i mean does that make any sense at all 

Recording: (1674/ 2140) 
um i mean obviously it is something that happens every day and things like that um it is like i said by no means am i saying yeah go president clinton or anything like that but uh i mean i can not say i would hold it against him for doing something like that i mean it is nothing that threatened the nation or whatever 

Recording: (1675/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1676/ 2140) 
like on a fairly regular basis even 

Recording: (1677/ 2140) 
yeah exactly which is one of the things that i ran into architecture where i mean we only had you know one or two papers we had to write 

Recording: (1678/ 2140) 
her and a mother went to see it and everything we were divorced at the time and uh then i went and bought the movie 

Recording: (1679/ 2140) 
and my mother was always there for me i would just call my mom like you know what can i do and she just like calm down rich will just calm down and 

Recording: (1680/ 2140) 
where where you are usually from 

Recording: (1681/ 2140) 
with out being with them 

Recording: (1682/ 2140) 
um actually i think it needs to probably start younger than that 

Recording: (1683/ 2140) 
and uh the other one is uh a uh working company at the student billahio uh 

Recording: (1684/ 2140) 
i am not sure i do not know his his dad found it and pulled me about it because i was not working at the time and we were trying to get an extra income to come in and um his dad made he actually like twenty five dollars or something you know i would think he would make more to the next month every time we go where there is a computer doing something so and i am on there you know just i look up baby stuff get coupons and stuff um um 

Recording: (1685/ 2140) 
for fun we have been playing a lot of pool 

Recording: (1686/ 2140) 
i was in marathon training i only got up to about nine miles and um i have unfortunately about fifty pounds of extra weight on me but even like i said when i was getting here i have like a on me on distance i am okay to run the lower but uh 

Recording: (1687/ 2140) 
she does not know that i do not go to church 

Recording: (1688/ 2140) 
or that are having kids and i mean we talk about that is all we do is sit there and talk about our kids and what they are doing and how our parents and them react to like there was this girl that just got in there today and and her parents are like flipping out because she is pregnant and um we were telling we were all telling her about you know um it it always starts out that way and they will ease up later on 

Recording: (1689/ 2140) 
exactly 

Recording: (1690/ 2140) 
that is okay too 

Recording: (1691/ 2140) 
you know so i do not know where to go to me the biggest thing would be if they got rid of these saturday night special guns and stuff like that 

Recording: (1692/ 2140) 
no my roommates are i just my mom wanted me too but i i the way it stands right now i just would rather work than money 

Recording: (1693/ 2140) 
well that is just it that is part of it because like i see my parents would not come my mother used to try to come to things at school but i would be in different things and and i have really did but my father would not he just she would say well you know he just does not like that kind of thing i mean i would be in a sunday spelling i would be in a he he does not well too bad get your butt down there and pretend like you like it and so you know with our and my husband is the same way his family was his father died when he was nine he was like the adult 

Recording: (1694/ 2140) 
and you went ahead and did it so 

Recording: (1695/ 2140) 
you know with while they totally erase the culture and all the stores and everything like that and the food uh you know the fast food or whatever they hate it at the same time because it is ruining you know and and and i had a lot of friends from elsewhere in you know western europe and uh you know they just were and i i was quite surprised actually because when i first went there uh i worked on an island previous i mean macint island you know which was just north of michigan but and i would met some english people there and it was you know there all the american 

Recording: (1696/ 2140) 
now i have parked over here on uh let me see the a section goes back in 

Recording: (1697/ 2140) 
oh my gosh 

Recording: (1698/ 2140) 
well it is where there is still a problem of it but i think it has gotten better at least if nothing else 

Recording: (1699/ 2140) 
you you would not i know right off the bat i would not be able to make as much money as him maybe if i do this college thing i would whack him out of the price range huh 

Recording: (1700/ 2140) 
take a french fries your ahead to just like no do not have to take a french fries 

Recording: (1701/ 2140) 
well i 

Recording: (1702/ 2140) 
fortunately we were out we were not in the country so we did not notice it we had just 

Recording: (1703/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1704/ 2140) 
down there with the laws and physics told me that those rocks could not sustain heat yet i see when the firekeeper breaks them out of the out the fire pit and brings them into the what well it is just their red orange blowing you know tell me they are not hot so that is that is one example um 

Recording: (1705/ 2140) 
right i keep thinking oh i want to go back and take some classes you know i keep thinking i would go back to school but i can not even narrow down what i would want to take there is so much stuff or so many areas that are interesting to me um-hum 

Recording: (1706/ 2140) 
sad stories uh let us see oh yeah 

Recording: (1707/ 2140) 
you know they never asked for extra money and uh they had to cut back on everything and it i think it just set people back now were trying real hard to catch up and at some point we are going to uh you know have to put a levy on again and and uh who knows what is happened we are keeping roses smith right now because she is so good pr with the with the business community but the business community in columbus does not really support the schools 

Recording: (1708/ 2140) 
stop without it um and and that is too bad you know that things are have been that bad in some like a world work too i mean we did not really have any choice there and not to but uh some of the some of our wars have been unnecessary and uh so but you know you can get you can get a philosophy but 

Recording: (1709/ 2140) 
because they always dress up and everything when they go to the bars so 

Recording: (1710/ 2140) 
or been around you know but um more i think doctors should more look on that avenue you know that it possibly it is something else like that i have never uh how to well now with the forms you fill out with your physicians and they ask you if you know about allergies and usually it is um prescriptions and things you know i mean that you have take but they i do not know i think a lot of things have to do with food dollar cheese anymore i really do 

Recording: (1711/ 2140) 
have it meeting the machines and 

Recording: (1712/ 2140) 
oh no no they move you around all the time when you when you teach kids with learning disabilities they move you to where the population is rather than move the kids to you so yeah i have been in columbus and worthing to know the two systems i have been in but you know the in those systems they can move you around from school to school i mean it is the same one now for this is my seventh year at the middle school 

Recording: (1713/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (1714/ 2140) 
um he is uh he is a broker he sells liquor licenses and things so he is owned several kinds of uh bars but originally he owned the um open the stay house which is real popular and actually um and then sort of like three years later so mainly clubs and businesses but two really good restaurants 

Recording: (1715/ 2140) 
used to be you lived in a little neighborhood you knew all your neighbors you do not have that now everybody is mobile 

Recording: (1716/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1717/ 2140) 
yeah and uh i had the prohibitive i could have gone somewhere else and made more money you know but the bad part was is the university is trying to do away civil service civil service is a good thing and a bad thing you know you do you had step raises and everything so at least you did have an increase back then nowadays you have yeah 

Recording: (1718/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1719/ 2140) 
yeah well and people is people do not have the priorities that they should you know what do you do you work all your life and you make a lot of money and then you die what did you you know did you learn anything did you teach anyone did you have an opinion about anything you know i mean that to me if you do not have time then you know you are just floating along i know taking up space no 

Recording: (1720/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1721/ 2140) 
yeah yeah say it is going to be hard to do in some of the other states but i do not think so 

Recording: (1722/ 2140) 
i just did not see where it would be used utilize here 

Recording: (1723/ 2140) 
oh yeah yes and no they are kind of where weird like that uh well i have said a grandparents really i can not hear ever says anything there is a set on the other side that they are a little bit more racist um but at the same time it i do not know they almost set up 

Recording: (1724/ 2140) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (1725/ 2140) 
the people who who really like my work happen to be the people who are vacationing from columbus so 

Recording: (1726/ 2140) 
and he is real because people give him that 

Recording: (1727/ 2140) 
i think more what they need to do is districts or uh just make stiffer penalties to people that carry the guns or that are overing shootings and things like that um because i mean for the most part i mean people really do not get too badly punished for things i mean if you look at other countries i mean like people like the asian countries places like that i mean they have really strict laws i mean if you even get caught for like 

Recording: (1728/ 2140) 
you know because everybody will be after i and then like the fact that he did not know like i think on international policy he will be struggling if he becomes president he did not know the three leaders of the world thing and then on top of it like texas is a fairly big economy but still like to manage an entire you know an entire economy 

Recording: (1729/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1730/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1731/ 2140) 
but north and mall is where i do go shopping 

Recording: (1732/ 2140) 
if you need them beat them 

Recording: (1733/ 2140) 
um yes and no i mean as far as the experience goes i mean i do not live on campus so i do not get the entire college experience you know the whole dorms and events going place on campus it is more things about picking shoes that i wanted do on campus i come down for um so i can not really say it is anything too drastic i mean obviously it is kind of weird when people asking what you are doing you 

Recording: (1734/ 2140) 
he can not trade that but yeah my my one sister that is uh exactly seven years older than me were the closest and then the sister that is two years older than me she does the same way she does a lot of things that i am like why are you doing that you know they will do that so it she she pretty much stays low and depressed a lot so many things she goes through but 

Recording: (1735/ 2140) 
i think he needs counseling at that point 

Recording: (1736/ 2140) 
yeah yeah i guess so i mean there are people spending seventy percent hours on computers doing this type of thing just going out there and seeing what they can find 

Recording: (1737/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1738/ 2140) 
then they are ready to move on again you just do not get as close to the people as you used to 

Recording: (1739/ 2140) 
um i mean the second matter is if being gay is a genetic disorder then that should have no affect on the kids because they should still be uh normal i guess or whatever you want to say 

Recording: (1740/ 2140) 
uh not as much as i used to be when i was younger used to be die hard but not anymore you know um-hum yeah by their standards but they still were six or six you know and they probably could have one maybe a couple more games but that is about it you know really 

Recording: (1741/ 2140) 
simply because it is not too much of a change from the status quo 

Recording: (1742/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1743/ 2140) 
he described in there 

Recording: (1744/ 2140) 
it has this little bridge that goes up to the front door and a creek i mean it is cool 

Recording: (1745/ 2140) 
she is pretty nice i mean she is definitely at least standable and 

Recording: (1746/ 2140) 
well i often have to write on papers i believe you turned in the wrong paper i believe i got the rough draft instead of the final copy do you have the final copy somewhere at home um-hum 

Recording: (1747/ 2140) 
yeah just in march 

Recording: (1748/ 2140) 
and theater and i go do not bother me i have had a bad day and i am tired you go watch tv and how are we raising children doing that you know you know and people say uh you have to both those incomes because we have to do this and go why do you have to have a house that is three hundred thousand dollars why do you have to have a brand new car you know is not life sacrifices i uh are not you supposed to like do best for your children you know i mean i my children do not have everything they do not have a saga you know my daughter has a car that goes to 

Recording: (1749/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1750/ 2140) 
almost all the parents did 

Recording: (1751/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1752/ 2140) 
um 

Recording: (1753/ 2140) 
where they are almost segregating themselves by having these organizations because they are geared specifically towards black people and i think in a way that someone segregating themselves from the rest of the community because they are not giving out equal opportunity of the people that need them um it is sort of like the same thing what people are doing you know thirty forty years ago where that they had their white organizations or whatnot um and i think it is sort of going along the same lines 

Recording: (1754/ 2140) 
that would be neat that would be real neat but that is true also 

Recording: (1755/ 2140) 
especially with kids it is just too overwhelming 

Recording: (1756/ 2140) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (1757/ 2140) 
i do not know uh maybe i think maybe if teachers just their status in society is not real high when it should be um it is more like i mean i have heard that like garbage men get paid more than teachers you know and how but it um so it is just like people always talk about you know education for the you know we got to like think about our child is future or whatever but really teachers are paid crap and like do not really get a lot of respect from anybody like professors and stuff 

Recording: (1758/ 2140) 
yeah if they want if they you know choose i am i am sure there is you know women that are lesbians that have been with men also you know they have been with the men and then they have been with the woman now now they got a girlfriend so obviously you know and i feel like that was because they they had an attraction towards a woman so now they think they are a lesbian i do not see i do not that is why i think so i do not think that but if that is their choice that is their choice so i do think they could change but 

Recording: (1759/ 2140) 
um i would say it does not really matter either way honestly i mean fact of the matters they are to deal with it i mean get over it i mean 

Recording: (1760/ 2140) 
um i think i think through education that is it is just gonna only help 

Recording: (1761/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1762/ 2140) 
um-hum it is it is it is american uh from the fact that it is um it was written by native americans and and and um and joseph smith was an american and he was used to to translate it so it is it is actually funny though but there there is more members of the church that live outside of america 

Recording: (1763/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1764/ 2140) 
i am trying to think uh it they are my it is a my brand i know that is what we have it is like frito is instead of uh 

Recording: (1765/ 2140) 
and the fact that i recognized all that and could not wait to get out of there and when i was gone i was gone and and even now we still have this ongoing thing where my family in fact they have been real unhappy about them lately because um i have we have lived in our same house for twenty years and my parents they they live in florida they um i mean they are not well to do by any means but they they are not liking for anything and they can afford to take plane trips and they can afford to go to california twice a year to

um you really need to start teaching uh what i call the older values but but but good values i do not care whether they are older or but good values and i think we really need to have that established within our educational system uh starting in the elementary right on up through college i think there ought to be a number of college uh courses uh that uh devoted exclusively for this so that those students came 

Recording: (1775/ 2140) 
um 

Recording: (1776/ 2140) 
so really that is about it i have a dog he is outside right now and that is it for my kids 

Recording: (1777/ 2140) 
basic where they learn things is their peers they do not get everything instilled at home uh that is pretty much what you know i have seen talk it to my husband and you know and there is so many broken homes and single moms and trying to trying to do do it all and the kids are the ones that are suffering and having to grow up before they are ready

yeah 

Recording: (1840/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1841/ 2140) 
they did not want the world war two vision anymore uh and i thought that was was was kind of interesting because by and large most young people also supported reagan and i thought do they really really understand different in issues and what the two stand for but it was that reagan appeared young and charismatic and so did clint so i think for the average voter that does have uh a lot of sway 

Recording: (1842/ 2140) 
you do not you do not use coupons 

Recording: (1843/ 2140) 
it is like a double scene i think it is weird

readers digest used to write their digest on the eighth grade level they now write it on the sixth grade level newspapers are written between fifth and sixth grade level for the general but it is just either we are getting more and more elderly kids that are not learned to read or um kids are just not as motivated because of video games and things that well i read one article that said that because kids sit in front of a television set 

Recording: (1849/ 2140) 
okay uh i have been in columbia since nineteen seventy seven and uh i am an air draft controller and i have three more days to work before i retire i am a i i i am retiring sunday so and tomorrow is my retirement dinner so i am a little nervous about what i have to do there you know they have told me nothing except show up 

Recording: (1850/ 2140) 
i i have make them you know time out well now for two minutes 

Recording: (1851/ 2140)

Recording: (1852/ 2140) 
actually in order to get in my room you have to be tested by the school psychologist and you have to qualify high as a learning disability kid in other words the way you qualify in the state of ohio is those you have a thirty point discrimination between your actual iq and your daily performance in other words let us say you have a hundred iq but in all their classes your forming like a seventy iq person would so if there is a thirty point discrimination in there and and people see that you are bright and but yet you are just not

i understand that but uh and then the one they do want you to do something they abuse the hell out you you know they give you a paycheck or a telephone they want to know where you are morning and night seven days a week and it is not another business um so uh the frustrations with trying to find an adequate job and an i quit an employer that understands my situation and and how i operate and well give me freedom to do what i can do i have a batch of 

Recording: (1888/ 2140) 
oh they do in ninth grade and by tenth grade in eleventh they are a little more focused on the fact that they better get their act together because they are going to have to go to college and this is like the only life they are going to get you know they kind of get that realization they start getting serious kids at middle school think everything is just a big joke you know oh i am going to play in a rock band you know they all think they are going to be rock stars and drumers and and you know they could care less about anything and it has not hit them yet this is my real life 

Recording: (1889/ 2140) 
and colin pine you know every paper had a slightly different slant on the story and you know their facts were all over the place but that is another kind of issue but um what i think caused it i mean i do not know i think that like more should have been made of the fact of you know this like terrible sort of resentment for the other students and and you know i am not 

Recording: (1890/ 2140) 
i do not think it would hurt me not knowing it 

Recording: (1891/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1892/ 2140) 
exactly 

Recording: (1893/ 2140) 
the discussion group about anything it is just a matter of finding it and it is within any within any denomination or within any religion you go as deep as you want to go you know there are people who just go on sunday mornings there are people just go on easter there are people who go monday wednesday tuesday um and sunday nights and saturday nights and i am very very very into that and i mean i am not the monday tuesday wednesday thursday type but 

Recording: (1894/ 2140) 
you know 

Recording: (1895/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1896/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1897/ 2140) 
i have talked to all my family my brothers and sisters every day 

Recording: (1898/ 2140) 
but it was not the worry about getting pregnant it was the worry about getting aids 

Recording: (1899/ 2140) 
yeah i mean it is like it is known but it is in a different way it is like a different type of fame than like the traditional style so it is like more of like a respect as opposed to like an operation type thing like like it is more of like a it is not like an mtv type thing you know 

Recording: (1900/ 2140) 
and you know i just really think they need to make that an uh an option for a young girl i really do because there is just you know there is just too many on one of children there just is and that really bothers me that we do not have another option like another country um we are a lot more right wing here in america but i just feel that is got to be an option you know for these young girls it just really does 

Recording: (1901/ 2140) 
so they thought well gee you know free country free land to a farmer so uh they went out there but had said in eleven years that they were out there they only raised three or four crops 

Recording: (1902/ 2140) 
um

um-hum 

Recording: (1904/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1905/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1906/ 2140) 
um freshman sophomore year yes after that i quit wrestling and i just kind of found myself being myself instead of trying to be someone else to be part of the team and the team tries to do everything the same 

Recording: (1907/ 2140) 
and your display might be different but it is it is basic information and our and we developed the system the people started doing that on us sharing the data um actually it started here they do not have a shoot campus and they were independent 

Recording: (1908/ 2140) 
and that is essentially what the supreme court said in their last decision on this two three years ago what they said was whether we think it is right or wrong whether we think the previous supreme court was right or wrong it is been a part of this fabric of this country for more than ten years and to reverse it would create too much too many problems for people you know uh which i thought was a nice way of saying sorry folks but you know it is too late 

Recording: (1909/ 2140) 
that is exactly what it is 

Recording: (1910/ 2140) 
um i think i think that there should be a mandatory because you have it in big companies you have mandatory uh sexual harassment tapes and and and you learn you teach the girls that it is not what they do it is how they make you feel it is it is instituted as your uh uh harassment there and they are too afraid and then besides that they you know there is crashes on you know you can not fault the girls for having crashes and things like that they are going through enough things as it is 

Recording: (1911/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1912/ 2140) 
more up there it is all go go go uh 

Recording: (1913/ 2140) 
well uh the first the first thing is clintonville 

Recording: (1914/ 2140) 
i would like to see that implemented something like that in the united states that would be a neat thing you know because like i know like iron boundaries and uh some like like the over paying jobs like they have people that are illiterate and things like that and they can not like give paychecks out on thursdays because everyone will call off on fridays because they will go out and get drunk or i do not know what they do with their paychecks i know that is a big big problem 

Recording: (1915/ 2140) 
you know so you can get a look at them which is very for some respectful but you know there is some psychos out there i mean i mean there is some right here in town called remo eagle gave himself that name 

Recording: (1916/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1917/ 2140) 
um he moved to texas because like he was moving into the like he was going to smu there and like so i moved back from florida back to up up here because i did not want to i do not want to go texas texas texas is terrible and like um so then like my mom she like my parents got divorced when i was like five or something and so 

Recording: (1918/ 2140) 
there were things out but there is nothing like what they have today you know small little handguns and things like that that are really as easy carryable and cartialable i mean like you know back in the sixties stuff like that i mean they had switchblades things like that i mean i mean there is really nothing too different 

Recording: (1919/ 2140) 
yeah right you can not take it with you or something yeah 

Recording: (1920/ 2140) 
well you know she sort of knows this is what she has to say at school if she is asked on a test because she needs the points for a grade 

Recording: (1921/ 2140) 
the bad place is the television things that they have on the programs they have on and i think the does that a lot to do with changing our younger generation and the way they think the way they act what their morals are and i think that is why they are having more shootings in schools and uh i the programs are terrible i think that they need to really redo them there is too much insanity there is too much sex there is too much just do what i want i got to do my own thing that is why i was not going to do i want to do my own thing start he says with the women is feminine movement but 

Recording: (1922/ 2140) 
so i i try to gear what he watches towards educational programming instead of just junk 

Recording: (1923/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1924/ 2140) 
you do it and i do tomatoes anyhow i will pay the extra higher price for the better ones but 

Recording: (1925/ 2140) 
honestly i do not think it ever really occurred to me

Recording: (1931/ 2140) 
be in turned away 

Recording: (1932/ 2140) 
but the federal government and their lawyers have done that and the department of the interior still considered native americans on the same level as a dog they do not have rights something wrong there and that still goes on a day after about six hundred years and we have got good people in this country that want to do something about it but unfortunately you know what i am finding you you got everybody is got to choose their path 

Recording: (1933/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1934/ 2140) 
whether they are play a video game where they are shooting people i can not say say that it is being something that affects them

Recording: (1941/ 2140) 
we try and you know we try and and teach and expand people is knowledge so that when they go out and they talk to someone about christ they do not have you know they do not have that blank look on their face when the person asks them something you know that somebody asks them something and they are like you know i do not know or they actually have an answer you know if if and if they do not know they will say i do not know but i can find out for you if you are willing to if you are willing to give me the time to go find out oh 

Recording: (1942/ 2140) 
great 

Recording: (1943/ 2140) 
but i do not know 

Recording: (1944/ 2140)

Recording: (1946/ 2140) 
it is about the same 

Recording: (1947/ 2140) 
um-hum and some conservative values too you know that the republicans are supposed to represent but i do not think they they they are doing a very good job of that 

Recording: (1948/ 2140) 
you know they talk about drinking from the fount and now they are only gargling they are not drinking much by the time they get to be fourth or fifth grade they are pretty savvy these days they are not too scared to tell you where to go and what to do 

Recording: (1949/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (1950/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1951/ 2140) 
oh 

Recording: (1952/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1953/ 2140) 
i mean i think the reason that our generation is cynical the reason i am cynical is because we are handed a world in which we see the injustice of the past or not the the the hypocracy i mean i guess injustice also applies in terms of things like the cold war and stuff that that is why i am i hope that answers your question at least a little bit i do not know i feel kind of preachy like this is my position 

Recording: (1954/ 2140) 
that 

Recording: (1955/ 2140) 
improvement in three months and all that kind of it was image and we were saying the same thing you know we want to continue this we want to make even this better um we learn to say the negative is in a positive way and that is important you know and you need to get that that you need to appeal to the center americans do not like extreme liberals they do not like extreme conservative you know they want they want peace 

Recording: (1956/ 2140) 
you know so i think maybe not universal health care but for children i think it would be helpful

Recording: (2011/ 2140) 
neither side is going to do anything about it somebody should have did something about that because then you know they would have been do doing what they were supposed to do to make him you know get in line and uh so he knew you could get by with it 

Recording: (2012/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (2013/ 2140)

Recording: (2022/ 2140) 
you know they all get uh sideline and side tracked by special private interest and that is that is a bottom line and it is sad but there is so i i choose not to involve my self and that as much as possible we ended up selling for 

Recording: (2023/ 2140) 
what i have liked so much about it is they tell you everything and then you find out that it is not right and that is right i mean there was the episode 

Recording: (2024/ 2140)

Recording: (2057/ 2140)

Recording: (2061/ 2140)

Recording: (2069/ 2140) 
uh-huh yeah yeah it is been glamorous and they do not they do not value human life either i do not think because there is so much violence you know you can not watch tv and not seeing somebody get shot or something and it is just like it is not really real because it is you know you turn the channel and then you see the same actor doing something else you know like seeing it was not real and i do not think they i think

Recording: (2074/ 2140) 
the three r is you know i think those are still very important 

Recording: (2075/ 2140) 
have guns or anything there i mean um you know i think they were sort of more concerned with you know actually it might have been later than the first um sex education we had that young i mean it might have been more like a couple like eighth grade that they would talked about condoms i doubt that they would have done that that early you know that i think about it but i know that there was at one point you know some sort of 

Recording: (2076/ 2140) 
right right 

Recording: (2077/ 2140) 
well i thought about that you know i mean doing something in the animal area even as a vet assistant but um with domestic animals um 

Recording: (2078/ 2140)

Recording: (2086/ 2140) 
everybody is living longer everybody is uh there is more medical things where people get uh can be healed on things that they could not be healed from uh so everybody today is uh basically is today as her future were back thirty years ago i mean when i was a kid you know i mean i would not really think about today i mean i was thinking think about tomorrow 

Recording: (2087/ 2140) 
that is a thing but the thing that some people some people say some people say well why do you do this and the thing is why do not you talk to those people say hey why not do do i am doing best i have a government the team 

Recording: (2088/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (2089/ 2140) 
um i think it is probably some of both i think it is probably more social but i mean obviously they are gonna have different views on how things work um but i mean for the most part i can not see that it is being too big of a problem um obviously there are more like violent guys out there and things like that than there are women but at the same time i would not say there is anything to over 

Recording: (2090/ 2140) 
no i i never i never looked into that but that is a good suggestion uh like spanish instructors no i i never thought about that not until you just just uh just just that so yeah or like teaching english as a second language i know they teach those here so i was thinking well you know maybe i should start looking into like teaching classes but i was like well i did not know that was like true not they could actually teach around 

Recording: (2091/ 2140) 
you know he did freeze but he knew i was not going to get rid of the cat i would had her she was my daughter

i my my kids went to a school that well my son had already left it but in the fourth grade they announced took all the kids in the other frame and said we are closing next year and it was hard but yeah once it is reached the point that the decision is made and announced and there were good reasons for it uh and they explain the reasons and you know at some point you have to figure out how much do you want to fight something 

Recording: (2093/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (2094/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (2095/ 2140) 
um i think i think through education that is it is just gonna only help kids because a lot of times maybe to they do not get that at home so they are really looking to choose the right thing to do 

Recording: (2096/ 2140) 
a lot of exciting stuff going on there for the library it is not not the old you know the little lady in the bund yeah yeah and the web has really changed that 

Recording: (2097/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (2098/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (2099/ 2140) 
on tv and in the movies 

Recording: (2100/ 2140) 
i do not even read it much it is very conservative very republican yeah 

Recording: (2101/ 2140) 
about you know and uh i was just brought up to being an honest person and um unfortunately there is a lot of people out there that you know they sell out their ideals and their principals for forty thousand dollars a year and then they use their family or their situation financially excused to sell those ideals out um not that kind of person and i will not ever be um so if that means that i stay monetarily poor 

Recording: (2102/ 2140) 
huh 

Recording: (2103/ 2140) 
exactly 

Recording: (2104/ 2140) 
i was more comfortable here than in high school do not see like the big click like the popular abracramby wearing people or like all the art students hanging in out together it is a big mix of people and everyone is doing their own thing 

Recording: (2105/ 2140) 
uh he was a uh railroad clerk 

Recording: (2106/ 2140) 
humum 

Recording: (2107/ 2140) 
i always wish somebody would redo a survey on how to say you know back in sixty five or whatever what is the difference between what they are teaching them then and what they teach them now is it really that i notice it is just our imagination just do not remember enough yeah but it seems more to me and computers really have helped it 

Recording: (2108/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (2109/ 2140) 
yeah it it might i mean good teachers do that i i i still get upset when i was teaching school i did activity based teaching um and and i was doing some volunteer work at doubleen schools was supposed to be one of the better schools in the area and i thought there would be all sorts of creative things going on and there was not it was still read the chapter right the answers to the question and i thought how boring i mean there are different ways to get kids turned on to things um i am not sure there is so much influence yeah 

Recording: (2110/ 2140) 
exactly 

Recording: (2111/ 2140) 
so that like that is just the sheer numbers of it i think 

Recording: (2112/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2113/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (2114/ 2140)

Recording: (2123/ 2140) 
left their uh part of it was my fault i was not very good at discipline in the classroom so yeah that was probably one of the biggest problems i had but uh 

Recording: (2124/ 2140) 
i mean i can not see it being a problem of any sorts um i mean just as long as they have someone that cares for the kid and does the stuff for them i mean i can not see it being any 

Recording: (2125/ 2140) 
you know 

Recording: (2126/ 2140) 
i learned about the sweats there is some people that uh taking pictures of sweat lodges which you are not supposed to do well they show step by step how to build one and and tell you what some kind of wood to build it out of and ninety percent of the time they tell you the wrong kind of wood um there is a way to do it and there is a way a way to do it uh it has to be done that way traditionally and there was a reason for that um because the people this land were given specific
