Recording: (440/ 2140) 
and i think umm f corse we al hoped the deborcion would not be that that nobody would have an abortion that would be the perfect world because nobody would ever be in a situwation whe they would ned one um but i also think i you now i mean i mean yeah there should not be the sould not sould not spend sic weks one abortion orr sic wekes on what to do if you ar pregnant um but but i think the subject has to be mentiond just just in pasing 

Recording: (441/ 2140)

that is perfect 

Recording: (838/ 2140) 
yeah just wone consert 

Recording: (839/ 2140)

right 

Recording: (850/ 2140)

Recording: (896/ 2140) 
yeah exactly i know 

Recording: (897/ 2140) 
yeah um-hum 

Recording: (898/ 2140) 
it is always ben my feling and and uh i try to be far in the way i grad um you know it is i triy to be as objective as i can som times i i because i think it is important that people learne how to right i woud aske al my clases to right an essay or a short 

Recording: (899/ 2140) 
you know 

Recording: (900/ 2140) 
yes 

Recording: (901/ 2140) 
thatis prety ectreme 

Recording: (902/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (903/ 2140) 
oh gs 

Recording: (904/ 2140) 
ther ideasand i mean the giyse are triying to lok older the girls ar trying to lock younger 

Recording: (905/ 2140) 
wel then they had to after that they had ther lotery number and that was not if yo were hot you know if you got youre number was piced i mean don kno wit wud be worse nowing tat you are gon get a notis and being able to prepar for it or uh because i ave had frends tha got u numbers and everything you know n and geting a hiy numbere and setingy are gong on like gotso 

Recording: (906/ 2140) 
um it was just yeah i ges the mofiah was a big problem they just take over everything and they they do not pay there workers andn most people are not mofius o they do not get paede 

Recording: (907/ 2140) 
but i do know my my my brother ind la mentciond to his uh parents s gosh what a sacrifice you gawyse did for us and he is yure trn and fifty and hey o nthave any kids and he sas wmn how you did itwe for wone thing they probly did a lot of sacrificing and when you ae sacrifised yit becomes yu you makes you more humble 

Recording: (908/ 2140) 
uh the yunger kids would not thinke anything about it 

Recording: (909/ 2140) 
uh a tip of life stil and that life stil is gon everybody is independent evebody is going there one ways and if you hapen to be lucky enouf to find somebody that is loking in the same direction you ar and is ecualy as independent then it might it might work but um you know and hou knows why each person get is divorced i mean each wone of theme was an individual situation and uh 

Recording: (910/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (911/ 2140) 
uhum from he watch toars yeah kind f lie you know lok ing up and say s yu know te sae bodi is you kow got the are sigts on me yeah because that is tha you is like you know like you know it thatit is like the wold woare to stufe you knw they is like the remanes i amn sure but t is like yo y ecase yo o se the wal i is like the ae i i mean si am sure te is lie the there uh what frm what i understan thet i as like 

Recording: (912/ 2140) 
u 

Recording: (913/ 2140) 
so howeve this workes out you know i do not knowi just i am just like okay she just sas i just want to get it over with in seven know she you know 

Recording: (914/ 2140) 
oh realy 

Recording: (915/ 2140) 
to be close i did not have to drive uu 

Recording: (916/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (917/ 2140) 
she that is great tho 

Recording: (918/ 2140) 
um so i mean basicaly my opinion on that is just leve it up to them i mean if they want to take the risks obviously they know 

Recording: (919/ 2140) 
if you yuf yu yf you say by by from those unscrupulouse bisnes people say uh se thes giys gan noth n credit yeahwhat hapens to that person that folowse bankcrupty uhby bankcruptiy il kanm i wl do som ting els gan tinks nekes nect time 

Recording: (920/ 2140) 
why realdyou think that is hapening right now because i think that i do not knw what the divorce statistics have ben reacently but i do se that more people wo are geting maried are staying mared because those that w do not those that would hav gotn a divorce they are not bothering to get mared to begin with they are just liveing tetogether and tent they seperat so wheat and i think that 

Recording: (921/ 2140) 
yeah and it it has the least amount of peple which is kind of net as fare as trurism so 

Recording: (922/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (923/ 2140) 
i am loking for a part time jobe as we speke i have ben like doing temperary on and of the thing with that is you can work you know for four five months and then nothing and then js like that so right now i am loking for something perminent 

Recording: (924/ 2140) 
you know just ecperiencing someone for ho they ar and so she is 

Recording: (925/ 2140) 
couple restarants or something but i mean it is it is different when you think of other sitis you know it is more of like a down towne thas where you go to hang out but here it is like campus and hr more of uh 

Recording: (926/ 2140) 
it was just so i did not objectd to that one at al 

Recording: (927/ 2140)

umhumumum 

Recording: (1392/ 2140) 
um 

Recording: (1393/ 2140) 
yeah eactly so you know wonce you wonce you get to a sertan degre of uh frustration you ned to relieve that somehow so that is prety much whiy we moved 

Recording: (1394/ 2140) 
realy 

Recording: (1395/ 2140) 
from our frinds that have gon yeah with the the are disiplin is ecpeling the child from schol wel they are ecpeling them to a hom whe the parent is working whe they are just geting thre days of fre play i mean prety much to get in truble and cause more truble they wrealy are not learning from that 

Recording: (1396/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (1397/ 2140) 
we ya yeah i think it is real important to realy god to get a god uh fel for how you are and al youre beliefes and al that they have to realy mach and um and if they dont um then it is not ever gonn work becaus becase there is always gona be conflict and friction and al that cind of thing so i think it is real important and there is no age limit aon that til when you realy feal gold about yourself and you realy now what you want to do then that is the only time that you can realy commit and say yeah we 

Recording: (1398/ 2140) 
yeah i think basicaly normal ours woud be like ihte to twelve and then you go home during lunch time because that is the big mealf te day you gow whome and eat with your family that is realy important 

Recording: (1399/ 2140) 
on sunda 

Recording: (1400/ 2140)
