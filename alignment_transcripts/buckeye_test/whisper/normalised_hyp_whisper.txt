Recording: (39/ 2140) 
i think the teachers are every bit as good as the students but i think there seems to be the whole administration up through the board and just it is not as i do not know how to describe it it is like the teachers are sort of it seems like they almost have the feeling they are on their own well i am going to go ahead and get started 

Recording: (40/ 2140)

Recording: (47/ 2140) 
i mean i had parents that everything i did was negative i mean they just told me i could not do this could not do that and so what i try to do is when anything comes up i always think of how my parents would handle it and i do 180 degrees i sort of feel i am mentally okay now but i do not know how i got here because i have been there way you know and it is you know 

Recording: (48/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (49/ 2140) 
it was part of the time 

Recording: (50/ 2140) 
but people coming from other cities like chicago new york and places like that where they were treated poorly by whites they tended to act differently towards you and everything until they realized that you were not like that you know we only had one racial incident when i was in the service where it was we were predominantly white platoon and because we worked in missiles and stuff you know so 

Recording: (51/ 2140) 
you know my daughter you know there is just a lot of stuff when she was in high school and i would call up to the school and you know the principal like he would say miss you know i am i am her last chance you know my daughter was going to summer school every summer and he is like mrs you know she is like you know the average student you

Recording: (59/ 2140) 
and so you know even though it turns out to be the real traditional breakdown it is not it is not because i have to it is not because he you know he would not do something that that something else this suits me fine

Recording: (83/ 2140) 
come to offer me that i mean she is the first i never even heard of it and there is all kinds of programs that you know like there is this one that where like say i live with my mom my mom can be getting paid from the government for me to be living there you know because she kind of helps me out you know and i do not know what that was called i mean i am just now finding this stuff out you know 

Recording: (84/ 2140) 
and not that that changed my opinion of her but back then and nobody would talk about it and i just think in today is world we need to bring subjects like that out because there are so many people who are ashamed about things and they should not be ashamed because it is a lifestyle anymore it needs to be brought up more 

Recording: (85/ 2140) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (86/ 2140) 
mother used to be a principal of mine in elementary school so he is like i think we should talk i was like okay great because i was like yeah boy you are way too serious for this particular affair okay that is fine we knew ahead of time that this was all coming to an end do not worry about it so i at this point in the story i should point out that the paper that i went downstairs for i do not know where that is i never found it never saw it never it is anyway not relevant in all the story but it bugs me every time i tell the story because does not exist anyway 

Recording: (87/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (88/ 2140) 
so what was different about it the things that i really enjoyed that was different was the traffic that really became interesting and different for me when i started working for a courier service winter quarter i took all classes off winter quarter and worked for a courier service because i needed some money and i love driving and let me tell you it is really really different 

Recording: (89/ 2140) 
and there are some people that deserve to be fired and there is no way that you can really differentiate just because they are in a union 

Recording: (90/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (91/ 2140) 
there was nothing there that really i can remember that did anything good for me i mean i think middle school taught me a lot more high school 

Recording: (92/ 2140) 
for the slick image it bothers me he has a potential of trampling gore i think that gore will be the nominee no matter what bradley does gore has it sewn up because he is the insider 

Recording: (93/ 2140) 
mbc 뉴스 김재경입니다 

Recording: (94/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (95/ 2140) 
right right that is right yeah so that was an interesting and when we went to church up hamilton and over to and out by carl there is shopping center after shopping center after shopping center after housing development after but when we did that 

Recording: (96/ 2140) 
to the other side 

Recording: (97/ 2140) 
terrible murderers get away with murder now by that plea bargain that plea bargain i think is a most thing that ever was passed i do not think should be any plea bargains and then there are people who get murdered and sent to the electric chair electric chair i still believe in it because if someone is and i do not believe that they should have 10 years of what do they call that legal process where they can bring appeals thank you that is it 

Recording: (98/ 2140) 
yeah because i mean five years went by like 

Recording: (99/ 2140) 
so 

Recording: (100/ 2140) 
oh that was the monica lewinsky 

Recording: (101/ 2140)

my honors class is challenging and organic chemistry is very challenging but 

Recording: (103/ 2140) 
she has trouble driving even at night and stuff like that 

Recording: (104/ 2140) 
before i found out actually so we can stop the story here it is a fun story 

Recording: (105/ 2140) 
and i did a lot of music interviewing and writing there and then i moved up to editor and it was sort of through that job that i got my first job with sony while i was as a sort of ohio representative so i was concentrated in ohio state and then you know basically it is just something i am not doing this as a career it is just sort of something i am doing in the meantime until i decide whether i am going back to school or not 

Recording: (106/ 2140) 
she is grown she is expanded her horizons if you will 

Recording: (107/ 2140) 
i do not have any evidence to support it i just know that i feel that i have a distinct a very clear distinction between what is fact and what is fiction what is true and what is imaginary and so for me i do not think that television has affected me in that way i mean one way that television has affected me is i am full of media references 

Recording: (108/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (109/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (110/ 2140) 
green bay packers 

Recording: (111/ 2140)

Recording: (112/ 2140)

Recording: (113/ 2140) 
that is still enough for me 

Recording: (114/ 2140) 
wow yeah 

Recording: (115/ 2140) 
i mean i do not know enough about it to really say but i can not i mean i do not know where they got that 

Recording: (116/ 2140) 
yeah i can not wait 

Recording: (117/ 2140) 
i mean i am not sure i am going to be able to do that not nice no 

Recording: (118/ 2140) 
you know 

Recording: (119/ 2140) 
and then when it became cold enough in september october maybe even as far as november this year would have been november we would take those shoes out and depending upon and whose foot fit those shoes those would be the person who wore them it would not be the one who had worn them in the spring because he is growing in the meantime and it may go to another another and i can remember we passed shoes down as many as four wee children now my dad also repaired shoes 

Recording: (120/ 2140) 
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah 

Recording: (121/ 2140) 
you 

Recording: (122/ 2140) 
well you have to try some different things like put on headphones with music that does not have any words and try to read somewhere 

Recording: (123/ 2140) 
yeah that is what they suggest doing is two years of med school get your phd and then do your last two years of med school 

Recording: (124/ 2140) 
oh there always has been there always has been i think a lot of people feel that kids a lot of kids are on medication today that should not be but i think that is the fault of the school or the parents or some doctor that like for example when we refer kids in worthington to a doctor we have a list of three doctors that we work with and we know that they will not just give this kid a pill if he does not have eight out of the 12 symptoms or 

Recording: (125/ 2140) 
i am sure i am sure it is you know it is just the circles i move in 

Recording: (126/ 2140) 
lsu 

Recording: (127/ 2140) 
10 years no question about it that is it you are in jail for 10 years 18 years old if you have got anything on you 10 years that is it and you look at some of these other people like these sports people and

yeah i am a democrat i have never voted for a republican in my life even when i lived in oregon and i always adored mark hatfield i did not vote for him i was out there with him we are insane because i thought he was a great republican but i think personally mike coleman was good i have met well 

Recording: (131/ 2140) 
needs for that budget they bought things on a cash basis as they needed it they did not go out and spend on credit business said hey let us produce these lines little lady you want a refrigerator we can make it for you and we can make it cheap for you because we can mass produce it 

Recording: (132/ 2140) 
i am sorry 

Recording: (133/ 2140) 
i mean i did not have the greatest childhood i do not think any of us ever really had the best you know but i do not like to talk to my kids the way some of these people talk well one today you know she got on the bus and a little girl went and sat over here she is probably about 8 maybe 6 or something like that and she wanted to sit here with mommy so she made her sit with her which is cool and mommy just goes to sleep and the little kids trying to study her homework you know

Recording: (136/ 2140) 
his mother died the week after he got married she had diabetes juvenile diabetes diagnosed at age 11 and just over the years i ended up having open heart surgery and did not make it through the surgery my grandmother also died during open heart surgery so my perception of open heart surgery even though i am a nurse it is not very good just because of the two 

Recording: (137/ 2140) 
you 

Recording: (138/ 2140) 
deep space nine in that they address the issue of different people living and working together you have different people of different i mean these were aliens rather than different ethnic denominations of humans but it approached that from a less from a more realistic standpoint instead of having an old star trek everyone gets along then we come to 

Recording: (139/ 2140) 
originally northside 

Recording: (140/ 2140) 
my son now i saw him when let us see he was 15 maybe he would run across the street when martha the 86yearold lady across the street was trying bring her garbage down he would seen me do that he would go oh let me get that for you martha she is got arthritis she looks like she is going to fall she takes steps about this big and i have seen him do that 

Recording: (141/ 2140) 
then you are really going to get out of it what you need to 

Recording: (142/ 2140) 
a good store to buy a swimsuit my sophomore year and he was the cashier there 

Recording: (143/ 2140) 
inadequate but that was even through nursing school i mean those were not things that were discussed you go to special conferences to get information on that 

Recording: (144/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (145/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (146/ 2140) 
you 

Recording: (147/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (148/ 2140) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (149/ 2140) 
yeah i like that 

Recording: (150/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (151/ 2140) 
yeah but i have got more influence i think maybe i am not sure i am hoping i have got more influence over him than his father does 

Recording: (152/ 2140) 
yeah i mean i want to see how the season ends out it is just a lot of the ones this season to me have just been disappointing i mean i think every show sort of has a peak some shows peak towards the end some at the beginning and sort of level off the simpsons had a stretch from like their third year through like their seventh where things were just like unbelievably funny and then they had some writing changes i think and this this season it is just 

Recording: (153/ 2140) 
and we started talking again and it was just like we had not missed any time and started dating 

Recording: (154/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (155/ 2140) 
whereas i do not know lutheran is a little bit more open to 

Recording: (156/ 2140) 
so we have really never had a lot of use for the union but recently we just figured out that you know if they decide to strike we have no choice too and you can not work because they will take all the money you make crossing that line so you cannot work anybody that came back to work will lose all the money that they made they will take them to court and they will get yeah it is against the union contract you had to say it 

Recording: (157/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (158/ 2140) 
i think that i do not think that divorce is a bad thing i think that if you are married and you realize that you get to a point where you and this other person are not in a positive relationship for each other or for anybody else in your family that it is better to just say this is not working we both deserve to be happy and go your own separate ways

you know concertina wire and barbed wire and all those like a big big brick wall and whatever you can actually still see it unless they tore it down okay just like to preserve the history of it okay right so you actually it is neat because you were like a part of that history at least when you were over there 

Recording: (227/ 2140) 
we are going to do and if they say then they really make it so and asked to three times on tape that they understand this before they sign this even within how could they say that they have got to come up with new rules and they have got to make the penalties stick 

Recording: (228/ 2140) 
well unfortunately i do not think it is fair but i think in the long run it does not have to be a college education because most of us people probably would not want a college education education but like a trade or a skill or something that will give them a little bit of hope if they do want to choose to get a job instead of robbing a bank or selling drugs or whatever they did they have that choice it is it is it is up in their head okay i can either go become a welder or a

in the business world in other words i used to work during high school days for a furniture company and in those days it was 90 days cash and we would sell it to people and we would just and we would talk to the manager oh they do not have the money it was financed through the bank well why are we selling it to them then well we will get our money back and the bank will get their money and we will repossess it and we have sold the same darn thing over three or four times

no i was born in new york i was in play i then went to tennessee with my family and that was after i was six months old 

Recording: (233/ 2140) 
i you know from my perspective which is skewed of course to me i think it just seems that way i mean it was we are only talking about ten cases that is not very many you know i mean you could by coincidence have them all be african american if i were african american i think i would have a different perspective and i do not live in a neighborhood where we see a lot of police so i am not in touch with it 

Recording: (234/ 2140) 
i think that is a good sign but i think there is a huge there is millions of children that do not have any health care and that is not right lot of like between the lower and the upper there is a huge disparity but at least it is a step in the right direction we have a nice solid middle income middle income middle income base i think because a lot of countries only have that like i visited mexico and it seems like they only had the distinction between the upper and lower i mean their middle class is very small and that i am

Recording: (239/ 2140) 
well actually it is sort of all happening in a certain area you know with very high unemployment like council estates this sort of stereotype bad family environment you know parents have loads of boyfriends and girlfriends drugs everything else and you know a lot of these girls that have been interviewed you 

Recording: (240/ 2140) 
were like oh english people your accent is so neat and all that kind of thing and then when i went there and this was actually one of my friends but i remember she was german and she was sort of asking me how you say different words and things and then she sort of looked at me and she said like oh actually i should not be asking you i do not want to learn the american way to say those like i want to learn the british way people would say things all the time and they would ask you what your background was and if you would say well i am american they would say well where you are 

Recording: (241/ 2140) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (242/ 2140)

Recording: (243/ 2140) 
yeah exactly passed through it random jobs for sure 

Recording: (244/ 2140) 
they went to private schools i certainly did not want them to go to public schools even when going to ohio state compared to miami university all different i see a difference in the standards of the students but i believe and i have seen it with my son going to ohio state that his moral that he is gained through his precollege years are staying with him and i am very grateful that there is

50 of everyone who marries has divorced within a matter of about five years as i understand the statistics today and unfortunately it is still increasing but there is a strong feeling that maybe this going to slowly reverse or at least decrease not reverse probably once again we are talking about communications too and the communications can be ill and they can be great as she is touched upon

Recording: (251/ 2140) 
mmhmm well you had a good reason to be bothered 

Recording: (252/ 2140) 
because then you know what if something major happens that fourth time then what but i think at least for children especially because they have no means to help themselves and like the parents obviously even if they are working a lot of times can not get health care for their children so i think at least for children how many accidents happen to children like people are always breaking arms and stuff 

Recording: (253/ 2140) 
saying that they wanted to save this nice white girl because i had so much potential and they were not going to let me throw my life away like this it was bizarre so i was always from that time on i decided these people are all crazy i am never going to be like that and so i have a whole lot of different values from my family and it is real hard for them because all my other siblings who are younger are willing to

at each other is throat for this that and the other and you know devin is with my daughters and when i really get put in the middle of it you know and probably it was a blessing that they moved to st louis because there probably could have been more problems legal problems you know as far as going back and forth to court and putting her on a witness stand for stupid stuff you know so in hindsight it was kind of a blessing that they moved there 

Recording: (285/ 2140)

yeah that is right frank sinatra is the one i was thinking i will do it i did it my way and that is really i think the biggest problem in the world today i want to do it my way my way and you can not or you got to cooperate with the other person 

Recording: (319/ 2140) 
and it is kind of weird because when i went from middle school to high school it was like a big growing up period and i see them like what are you doing that for 

Recording: (320/ 2140) 
sounds a lot like our dog 

Recording: (321/ 2140) 
and that was part of the process there how to work work and work up there too with people but if we could just share more 

Recording: (322/ 2140) 
have those apostles and to have the church set up like it was and it must have been really strong because it still lasted all the same catholic and all the orthodox churches still carried all these beliefs

they are normal people just outside of their sexual well majority of the people prefer heterosexual 

Recording: (324/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (325/ 2140) 
well this is about giving opinions and my opinion about the columbus public school system really is not good 

Recording: (326/ 2140) 
but they always say do not let the animals sleep with you and all that and with the cat they curl up with you it is hard to say no but you know what honestly eventually it took probably a year 

Recording: (327/ 2140) 
네 

Recording: (328/ 2140) 
really and it is a fun job it really is i have only ever known one male that taught first grade and i knew one guy that taught third most of the time if they go into elementary ed they go for the upper grades like 4 5 or 6 but i really think that if we let the boys always be more exposed to men earlier then they would be more motivated to learn because they would see that it is not just a girly thing 

Recording: (329/ 2140) 
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 

Recording: (330/ 2140) 
yes 

Recording: (331/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (332/ 2140) 
if it were possible i think that a lot of parents are trying to raise them what they think is the best right now and that is another problem it seems like the way the finance world has come up and everything else the way the cost of living has increased it almost takes two parents in that home if you want to really live a halfway decent life and be able to do some of the extra things things no one wants to live and only have to be able to disuse like you said the necessities 

Recording: (333/ 2140) 
yeah where are they needed right 

Recording: (334/ 2140) 
no 

Recording: (335/ 2140) 
you know he says that e equals mc squared i say it is e equals mc cubed because the world is three dimensional it is not two dimensional dimensional limits and everything but you look at history relativity all of our mathematical theorems physical theorems on physics and things of that nature have been based off that 

Recording: (336/ 2140) 
now is when i need to be off with them where we can take them out and run 

Recording: (337/ 2140) 
for parties so because it is actually a market it is all done outside like tonight we are going to the uh gobleth pavilion which is um it next to the it is really beautiful and people do a lot of parties there 

Recording: (338/ 2140) 
and he did that too 

Recording: (339/ 2140) 
it is like with this adoption of the baby we know that that is best but dealing with the emotions of it we are very family oriented and this is a grandchild we will never see 

Recording: (340/ 2140) 
and just totally bombarded and i mean here it is so forcefed as well i mean i came home just before halloween and you know i walked into the grocery store i mean just like right there were just like cakes cupcakes cookies like everything just right in front of you with like all this halloween stuff on all the holidays in here are so pushed at you and it is such a money making you know and it is so over the top where there it is sort of like there is a little bit of that and there are decorations and stuff 

Recording: (341/ 2140) 
if you just look at the nature of what they are doing it is just 

Recording: (342/ 2140) 
yeah well it was like i kind of just like stopped going to class and and like i just like ended up withdrawing because i would have like failed everything anyways but yeah then i was living with my friend for a while but and then like now i now me and her and my other friend live in down under maynard 

Recording: (343/ 2140) 
and then they are going to say they want to nail their parents their parents are sitting at home they have no idea what that kid is doing 

Recording: (344/ 2140) 
rate well kind of like just because everybody else is doing it this way it does not mean it is the right way and yeah i you know i really really struggle with that because i come more from i think the family should teach it but let us be realistic how many families are going to do that or how the mentality to do that it seems like so like my dad it seems like these days most of the people a lot of people that are having kids you 

Recording: (345/ 2140) 
which was see with those guns of ours we figured within 10 yards was a hit if you had one of those things 37 pounds of tnt would go off within 10 yards of it 

Recording: (346/ 2140) 
i just renewed my certificate last year so i may get back into it part of the reason i renewed my certificate was i did some home instruction with the columbus public schools last year and that is kind of like a tutoring job where you can go you can arrange hours with a student that is at home for some reason i had one that just had a baby and they it is an interesting job because they look for somebody that can cover 

Recording: (347/ 2140) 
run quick put plastic on oh i do not know it seemed like it is a tough call because it is a very unusual situation here at ohio state where they have a union and they have so many different skills in a union you think of unions you think of auto workers you think of pipe fitters you do not think of such a wide variety of 

Recording: (348/ 2140) 
the one that is 18 now i thought he was going to be left handed up until he was like four because his dad is left handed my sister is left handed i have one left handed parent well all of a sudden in one day picked up a thing with the right hand and he is been with his right hand ever since so you really can not tell because they are pretty much either or until they were about five 

Recording: (349/ 2140) 
i mean columbus public they got some work to do too like the other night i was watching tv and an elementary school overdosed a kid on like some i think it was a drug to calm him down so he is not so hyper and they like overdosed him like twice in a day and then when he goes home his mom is even overdosing him because they are overdosing him 

Recording: (350/ 2140) 
i do not know i would like to say no sitting here but you never know because i guess that is what happens to a lot of them they come out of school all idfree idealistic and then they go into industry and then they are molded and assuming they make upper management there is you want the tax breaks you want thing you know i mean and then the other like i have an uncle he is a vice president on wall street for merrill lynch and he said you know he got out of school and he was very idealistic but now he 

Recording: (351/ 2140) 
sure you do something with them but this group the middle 30s i called them you had to misogyism and that is what clinton did so well and that is what dole could have done i am not sure if george w is going to be able to because to get the nomination eventually he is going to come out and have to make his hard statements to those people which is i am antiabortion progun he is already said the progun and that is going against what most americans are saying dole i think represented where most americans 

Recording: (352/ 2140) 
oh yeah yeah 

Recording: (353/ 2140) 
quarter 

Recording: (354/ 2140) 
and i think some of my feelings about that sort of thing is colored by the fact that i collected data for 20 years from employers i am a lot more sympathetic to that sort of thing yeah i am just a lot more sympathetic to people collecting data 

Recording: (355/ 2140) 
down 

Recording: (356/ 2140) 
whoa 

Recording: (357/ 2140)

Recording: (360/ 2140) 
i know people that sleep outside and not all of them are veterans and everything but there again they do not want to be a part of the quoteunquote sheltered system you know staying in an open shelter voa or something like that 

Recording: (361/ 2140) 
i was 48 when i retired it is great it is terrific 

Recording: (362/ 2140) 
and they will ignore them will not they because they are in their good sunday clothes 

Recording: (363/ 2140) 
oh yeah it is so much better than having an alley or sitting there on your deck and looking at your house the neighbors right behind you you are staring at them sitting on their deck we got all woods and a creek and then the golf course so that is hard to find in the city limits because we are inside 270 still 

Recording: (364/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (365/ 2140) 
mm 

Recording: (366/ 2140)

well the charge was cutting class yeah and what it was i was supposed to meet my mom outside i told my teacher i brought a note got to excuse slip and all that i went down to my locker before and the teacher we called her the general because she would always be out there watching you not a teacher but an administrator excuse me and she was out there and she saw me in my locker and what are you doing down here in the whole 30 minute 

Recording: (369/ 2140) 
yeah i would be at least 30 maybe like getting up towards 40 before i have the experience really necessary to get in a good job i do not want to be i mean like my uh venturing crew advisor is 38 and retired i mean i am going more for there 

Recording: (370/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (371/ 2140) 
a couple movies here and there but we see what they rent or take out compared to the cartoon network and all these crazy just seem so worthless nowadays but actually you watch some of the older cartoons that we watched and they seem more violent than some of the new ones you know daffy duck and the road runner and these types of things all it was was kill the fox so we were like wow i do not know if we want to let them watch that either yeah they were

mmhmm 

Recording: (376/ 2140) 
well i do not know if it is monroe county or

Recording: (378/ 2140) 
yeah as i was teasing 

Recording: (379/ 2140) 
i know 

Recording: (380/ 2140)

Recording: (381/ 2140) 
the room and she has a two year old child and now another little girl i said derek you know it is nice to go in there and see that but i just have no 

Recording: (382/ 2140) 
because the priest they had there would not let him take communion and all the other kids were taking communion and that is pretty much the priest decides that and he felt singled out and he was he was the only one and he was uncomfortable with it but it has not been a problem person myself but i am not against it and maybe i have justified it to myself by saying well they are teaching values 

Recording: (383/ 2140) 
it is a clinical study where we are seeing how treadmill training affects ambulation in people with spinal cord injury 

Recording: (384/ 2140) 
on the spur of the moment i would have to think about that i really would 

Recording: (385/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (386/ 2140) 
it is just like the people you see go to church i walk out of church and see somebody sitting there that is homeless

and just start picking a fight with him 

Recording: (392/ 2140) 
in the tin 

Recording: (393/ 2140) 
i think it has changed drastically and i think it is changing and i think it will also be changing in the future going all the way back finances were not a consideration in the oh i would say probably my first 30 maybe 40 years there was some influence but i think the influence was not financial it was influence from the person who could get up here and talk with a group of people and sway them with 

Recording: (394/ 2140) 
is that right 

Recording: (395/ 2140) 
sure 

Recording: (396/ 2140) 
exactly 

Recording: (397/ 2140) 
yeah it got into a situation where you really were not there was a nowin situation from the getgo and i think that had we been able to do what we were able to do went over there to do initially it would have worked out okay but we were not so it became a political war as everybody knows 

Recording: (398/ 2140) 
got a ways to go it is getting bitter 

Recording: (399/ 2140) 
hediye etsene 

Recording: (400/ 2140)

well the wolf family and the mcconnells have been around forever you know worthington industries and the wolf family is close to spatch you got i think it is for zutty he is like it was a construction guy so they have been around forever and everything and they can get their ways through political arenas and everything but i think most of the money was was private money but they were given like tax money 

Recording: (404/ 2140) 
and mybut now my daughter ismy daughter has twin sons who just are a year out of college i think that they are one of them particularly is i think in good moral good sort of guy and the other one i do not feel like i know as well but 

Recording: (405/ 2140) 
all right 

Recording: (406/ 2140) 
mmm 

Recording: (407/ 2140) 
there is a lot we need to do a lot of evolving we definitely do 

Recording: (408/ 2140) 
i think it was a nice thing about what we had we had grandparents that were not necessarily they were out of state in some cases we did not see them that much we made it a part that we communicated with the grandparents regularly and when we did it was a special time emphasize the fact that kids want to do certain things they saw their mother go out and maybe do some additional things to 

Recording: (409/ 2140) 
hmm 

Recording: (410/ 2140) 
forced to take this class i think that if i i mean it is good to being forced to take a liberal arts thing because you do not know what you want to do so it is like if you hate math and you do not take it at but then you decide you want to do something in math and you are like screwed like can not go back 

Recording: (411/ 2140) 
like the continent 

Recording: (412/ 2140) 
oh really 

Recording: (413/ 2140) 
um well as far as my mom issues realm of the catholic faith and i mean she made me always go to church and things like that 

Recording: (414/ 2140) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (415/ 2140) 
but it is parents that fight for the society and what is in your community you know the parents for each individual child they have to all form together as a group and almost be a parent to all these kids as a group you can be the best parent in the world at home and then your kid goes to school school and it accesses the computer or they get in a group of kids where their parents do not even know where they are it is the kids responsibility to get and go to school maybe the mom and 

Recording: (416/ 2140) 
home we interact the school is great you have people that are on the clock whoop time to quit they are gone those people do not know the meaning of life they will never know the meaning of life but if they stay around try to extend themselves a little more with somebody that is problems at work and are willing to work with that person i say willing to work not knowing they are going to be compensated because they will be compensated 

Recording: (417/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (418/ 2140) 
you know like there are two fishermen that found him at sea you never hear about the other one because this was on one just briefly i heard on the news because he thinks he should go back to his father but you do not hear about him there is three cousins two of them think he should stay in miami the other one thinks he should go back with his father you do not hear about him he is reading about him in newsweek or someplace so i think the news media has not been totally objective about this 

Recording: (419/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (420/ 2140) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (421/ 2140) 
they are covered but it was real tricky because she was a us citizen she fell in love through email over the internet back in the early like 1990 it was real early and went over there and married the guy and so she had some of the medical problems and she emigrated it took years to get that straightened out but she is covered now 

Recording: (422/ 2140) 
how many times have you been in ireland 

Recording: (423/ 2140) 
if they had a way to cure it then fine but leave that up to the people 

Recording: (424/ 2140) 
that is how i feel that is what i believe i choose to believe that 

Recording: (425/ 2140) 
well it is like the 

Recording: (426/ 2140) 
this just can not go on not that they are going to stop it totally 

Recording: (427/ 2140) 
going to be a really busy day and the same thing at port columbus i would see all these cars but it would be just about the same traffic and i mentioned to somebody i go where are the extra planes and they go they can not add extra airplanes they have certain routes they can do they just have to put bigger airplanes on so they said you know you will see larger airplanes when it is hollow time so they can put more people on 

Recording: (428/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (429/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (430/ 2140) 
yeah we need to pay the rent and that is yeah 

Recording: (431/ 2140) 
there was snow or something 

Recording: (432/ 2140) 
yeah so she said she is going to be catching the disability bus out here you know after a certain amount of time she is going to ride that bus 

Recording: (433/ 2140) 
or more accurately i think she took it but it is a fine line and so she wears that around and i replaced it so i have my own again i wear this one around so we have competition to see who can get the most welltraveled ring you get two points for every country and you get one point for every state or province within that country 

Recording: (434/ 2140) 
hmm 

Recording: (435/ 2140) 
mmhmm mmhmm 

Recording: (436/ 2140) 
i like to talk about columbus 

Recording: (437/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (438/ 2140) 
okay let us go 

Recording: (439/ 2140) 
what we should buy yeah the retail what we should buy and that is the problem we listen to business too much if business reemphasized their goals to help society out and not themselves 

Recording: (440/ 2140) 
and i think of course we would all hope that abortion would not be that nobody would have an abortion that would be the perfect world nobody would ever be in a situation where they would need one but i also think you know i mean yeah there should not be there should not should not spend six weeks on abortion or six weeks on what to do if you are pregnant but i think the subject has to be mentioned just in passing 

Recording: (441/ 2140) 
i think for the most part people can handle it obviously i think probably more the older generations would be the ones that would have the bigger problem with it the ones that grew up during the whole black rights movements and things like that i could see them having a problem with it but i mean more like like 

Recording: (442/ 2140) 
i mean i liked earl bruce and i waited on him a couple times at a restaurant i worked at he was the nicest man and when they did that i do not know if you know about that when they fired him the day before for the michigan game for having a 93 season three years in a row they fired him the day before that game 

Recording: (443/ 2140) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (444/ 2140) 
i do not know trial stuff i also would not mind doing since i will have a business degree i would not mind doing some sort of financial laws stuff i do not want to be an ambulation i do not want to be an ambulance chaser i just want to be somebody who helps screw all the big giants 

Recording: (445/ 2140) 
break 

Recording: (446/ 2140) 
we do have a mutual thing and young people there you know there is so many different infatuations to start with that they get blinded and they get you know off course and everything else and then it does not stay the same i mean it is all exciting and all that and then i think it is kind of 

Recording: (447/ 2140) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (448/ 2140) 
mmm 

Recording: (449/ 2140) 
we dated in high school but he ended up going to prom with somebody else we went to kindergarten all the way through and my sister and his sister were the same age and my mom and his mom were campfire leaders together in the whole bit and then we did not really date in college kind of really did not get together at all freshman year he did go to school here and then as i said i swam for ohio state and then i went into agler davidson a sporting goods 

Recording: (450/ 2140) 
i have been here all my life right now i do not do anything i had a head injury in 93 where i got hit with a hockey puck in the head chill hockey game 

Recording: (451/ 2140) 
well i have different options i am thinking i could either be an art teacher or have some kind of freelance type thing for my home and i really want to just hurry up and get done with it school as fast as i can my husband and i really want to have kids and so we do not want to wait very much longer this 

Recording: (452/ 2140) 
yeah it is and it seems to me that they do not keep the very very best of the kids in state but it gets a lot of the like just below the absolute best in and it keeps a lot of them here 

Recording: (453/ 2140) 
yeah it is my daughter yeah 

Recording: (454/ 2140) 
and we had like tapes we listened to with native speakers so you got really good really quick 

Recording: (455/ 2140) 
um 

Recording: (456/ 2140) 
because they feel they have the need for it there is so many golfers i mean sports went sky high my mom used to play golf growing up and they only let the on the golf courses one day a week which is amazing it was like on a tuesday and when i lived in florida a lot of the courses were like that too and i thought they are only allowing women one day a week you know is not that amazing there is so many good women golfers now but they said they are too slow and they always talk and that just killed me when my mom that is the only day she is ever been in a wheelchair

Recording: (460/ 2140)

Recording: (461/ 2140) 
and so basically they decided to build a new building adjacent to the church tacton and we they i asked the choir for input 

Recording: (462/ 2140) 
i think it fills its niche i mean wexner has a niche and the museum has a niche and i think it fills it very well 

Recording: (463/ 2140) 
what happened was we know one of the people on our committee teaches in the math department here 

Recording: (464/ 2140) 
oh i am not shocked at the bad behavior of the animal i do not consider it is justice

just like almost out of control 

Recording: (466/ 2140) 
i do not know she does not move anymore and she has to i am the one that loves to exercise 

Recording: (467/ 2140) 
if you come from a situation like that that does not mean you have to be like that do you know what i mean 

Recording: (468/ 2140) 
i think so i think so if you are willing you know anybody who is willing to put out the effort i mean you do have to you know you have to sell yourself there is you know you are not going to just sit around and wait to be discovered but if you put out the effort i really do not think there is that kind of discrimination anymore 

Recording: (469/ 2140) 
yeah and i think i am a firm believer that little subtleties like that to yourself are much better than looking in the mirror and going look at them hips and you go this way and you go i am getting a gut and you know it is like that is so negative to yourself would you tell your mom that you know 

Recording: (470/ 2140) 
they would never say anything terrible to you or anything but it was just sort of you know that feeling of 

Recording: (471/ 2140)

Recording: (473/ 2140) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (474/ 2140) 
but you guys the thing is just you have all these people in your gotta keep their attention for like an hour or two 

Recording: (475/ 2140) 
there were people i met through friends actually one of my friend is parents had a friend that was gay and just be over there or whatever i mean i can not say there is any big difference between 

Recording: (476/ 2140) 
well the psats and the you know just all those centralized scoring systems they have they pretty much told me that you know my scores when i was in what was it fifth grade yeah fifth grade they said that i was i had a high iq and i could be doctor lawyer yada yada yada 

Recording: (477/ 2140) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (478/ 2140) 
and why what he is too busy 

Recording: (479/ 2140) 
like you know 

Recording: (480/ 2140) 
took a lot of time 

Recording: (481/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (482/ 2140) 
they just called me on the phone not knowing you know just that she went to the hospital well they said to me will you stay well i said yes but then as when it got into two weeks and i was not getting any support from the principal or no aid or anything it is like i am sorry i am a substitute substitute i am getting $60 a day i can not do this unless i have more help and i just flatly said that 

Recording: (483/ 2140) 
and that is what we did and so he is just like my own too now i go and volunteer he is in kindergarten i go and volunteer in his classroom too so it is kind of like i hope i get to do this forever 

Recording: (484/ 2140) 
and they do everything they possibly can to make me happy and it is like my oldest girl we are expecting our first grandchild here within a couple weeks she and i see each other all the time my daughter who goes to ohio state chose to live at home because she just said it was just a better situation for her it is not that these girls are not independent and can not do it on their own my second daughter could have lived on her own from the time she was 12 i mean she is just very very and we will see you next time 

Recording: (485/ 2140) 
short essay for a test but the way that i would grade those would be pretty scientific i think i would come up with a rubric and i would say you need to mention certain things and i will give certain points for your mentioning certain things i have never been a teacher who is had to assign or grade creative writing i am not sure i would know how to do that 

Recording: (486/ 2140) 
you know talk to her but people do not when i was 14 i did not care what anybody told me i was going to do it no matter what 

Recording: (487/ 2140) 
yeah i think i got really good i have actually been sitting thinking about it like what departments in the school were good and which ones were not the foreign language is really good they have immersion classes from like second level 

Recording: (488/ 2140) 
i will raise them the best way i can 

Recording: (489/ 2140) 
it counts if you are touching the ground or if something that you are sitting on is touching 

Recording: (490/ 2140) 
um actually i was over there when all of that happened but of course it was all over the papers and you know i think i mean i do not know what what it was like really here i can imagine but i mean there especially they really focused on not columbine but the one with the younger kids in arkansas was it i was there for both of those but in the first one they put the picture of the little kid in combat gear holding the gun everywhere 

Recording: (491/ 2140) 
let is watch 7 to 9 

Recording: (492/ 2140) 
i was which is fascinating but you know i mean our first day i walked in he said hey i am tom you ever smoked pot before i was like no he said we got a whole year together and i am directly quoting that is the first thing he said to me that is the first thing 

Recording: (493/ 2140) 
and the second tornado it was not as bad i mean we was driving up after he ripped me off and he said well i am taking your sorry ass back to columbus and i said okay go for it i am just sitting there smiling all the way up knowing what he did not know we get the tennis see and the weather is kind of bad there too i am like hey man slow down you do not have any windshield wipers in the middle of this rainstorm 

Recording: (494/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (495/ 2140) 
i hope so yeah 

Recording: (496/ 2140) 
and so i think it gets driven home i think the media does that in a lot of places they pick something that is sensational and keep they are making it even more sensational like when john kennedy died 

Recording: (497/ 2140) 
it is really beautiful out there we like mountains and walking around we got married in lake tahoe which is really beautiful 

Recording: (498/ 2140) 
bye 

Recording: (499/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (500/ 2140) 
he is a picky eater which he yeah he does not like everything 

Recording: (501/ 2140) 
like it is everything pretty much i mean like basic stuff that you it would be like you know like a lazarus or something like that you know or or a bunch of places like electronics appliances 

Recording: (502/ 2140) 
if there were any germans in there i will bet they are scared 

Recording: (503/ 2140) 
and i would just hear things 

Recording: (504/ 2140) 
me too 

Recording: (505/ 2140) 
um i am a lutheran and a lot of what he says about everyone going to hell 

Recording: (506/ 2140) 
as back in the high school 

Recording: (507/ 2140) 
i and stuff like that with them 

Recording: (508/ 2140) 
well the crime you can not really stop and other things that happen just too much partying around left 12th avenue because i could not you know but you know just everybody on the neighbors being loud and everything my mom is older so she can not really put up with it any of that 

Recording: (509/ 2140) 
like i am not really sure how the interview works to become a teacher i do not know i think it is like a lot of times they are really desperate to find people and so they really just take whoever i mean they are lucky enough to even have a body to fill the place and they are doing well enough i mean the kids are learning the material i mean sort of i mean it is working well enough i guess 

Recording: (510/ 2140) 
north 

Recording: (511/ 2140) 
that goes with the disorder they know who is button to push and when not to push a button and how far they can go and where the line is and they push you always that is why teachers they drive the teacher up the wall 

Recording: (512/ 2140) 
i think society of today is less tolerant of a lot of things that they see where people getting by with stuff you know and they are more vocal about it as opposed to being violent about it back in the 60s and stuff you know not here but you know down south there were people still getting hung and stuff for being a black or something and there are bad blacks and there is bad whites too 

Recording: (513/ 2140) 
well 

Recording: (514/ 2140) 
i 

Recording: (515/ 2140) 
you know so you can use all those opportunities to show your kid what not to do 

Recording: (516/ 2140) 
well i mean to me the whole thing is wrong regardless of if you are guilty or innocent to me there is worse things i would think than dying i know in israel israel the guy who killed yitzhak rabin he got locked up and he is not allowed to see it because under jewish law you can not kill 

Recording: (517/ 2140) 
and now it is our turn to deal with the issues we see our parents we see this generation all these things that are still popular so we do not look down on the 60s i think the 60s sound and like a pretty fun time to live i will get into politics in a second but those things are popularized but no we can not do it anymore because we have got all these problems and the other ones 

Recording: (518/ 2140) 
cause they would not let him when i was there 

Recording: (519/ 2140) 
i am not sure 

Recording: (520/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (521/ 2140)

Recording: (522/ 2140) 
yeah he is teaching us system five it is just funny 

Recording: (523/ 2140) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (524/ 2140) 
but i think i like that how it is kept with a sort of tension and it is not like you know they are not completely thrown together like belanna and tom which i do not like that at all 

Recording: (525/ 2140) 
and he could not have any kind of caffeine otherwise he would get the shakes and he took all kinds of pills

i do not know do you know anything about unix 

Recording: (530/ 2140)

Recording: (531/ 2140) 
wow 

Recording: (532/ 2140) 
the problem is lack of commitment lack of commitment and not saying hey there is a niche for you you can not be a male oh yeah you want to do the operation i can not be female why not be happy what you are god made you what you are why not make you the complete person you are and not strive for something you can not be 

Recording: (533/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (534/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (535/ 2140)

Recording: (540/ 2140) 
that ran down oh 100 200 yards from the gun position so we took off down there 

Recording: (541/ 2140) 
you 

Recording: (542/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (543/ 2140) 
i think there might be but i think most of them are a dying breed they are the older citizens many in my generation they would probably be i am the first of the baby boom that is when the women is movement started many men still have not accepted that for the generations even the later baby boom generations behind me when i talk to them i talk to high school students or even young college students 

Recording: (544/ 2140) 
no no they did not they did not pay for grading or preparing your classes or researching anything so right but but still even though it was real a very much underpaid job i i liked it when i did it i liked the introduction to the arts class because i had to develop my own curriculum for it right they had a when they told me i 

Recording: (545/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (546/ 2140) 
the beginning of the end yep i grew up in upper arlington yeah really those five miles make such a a difference though yeah because i live on campus 

Recording: (547/ 2140) 
you 

Recording: (548/ 2140) 
well it is not that there is been too much growth i mean growth is good but now they need to stop 

Recording: (549/ 2140) 
well it is not how it is put into effect the law it is how it is enforced you do not just say well you know little johnny stuck his finger in a pie and you can not do that anymore the more security you are going to have over that pie the more he is going to want it yeah so and going into the gun thing it is pretty much nobody is winning game i mean you make stricter laws 

Recording: (550/ 2140) 
and so you had 

Recording: (551/ 2140) 
oh ja 

Recording: (552/ 2140) 
the direction is being pushed or they are being pushed 

Recording: (553/ 2140) 
they just got different beliefs she believes i mean like one thing she believes all men will cheat 

Recording: (554/ 2140) 
yeah much too fast for me 

Recording: (555/ 2140) 
but it is not going to work i mean if you are around people i mean number one they are around their parents and their siblings and that is socialization you go to church or to the library or wherever i mean you are around people and you are around children and they get to i you 

Recording: (556/ 2140)

just carrying around a gun and shooting someone 

Recording: (561/ 2140) 
he has not questioned me like that but i see a lot of things coming out he is doing more in line he is been doing things a lot more differently than my daughter because my daughter was away at school and he he is with us every day he stays home he does not want to stay on campus he does things voluntarily we do not have to coach him team 

Recording: (562/ 2140) 
well i think a little bit safer idea than eliminating guns because you know there is always going to be weapons out there instead of eliminating the problem more centralized it make it a national law that you have to be a certain age give a certain time period for your background checks and whatever else kind of record finding they need make sure you are 

Recording: (563/ 2140) 
commodore 64 is they have heard of it but they really do not know what a brilliant system it was at its initial stage and it just got bowled over because you know something better came out something better will come out than windows microsoft will eventually go under it is just going to take a while oh yeah i give it probably about six or seven years before somebody comes out with a system that is just as good as mine 

Recording: (564/ 2140) 
and just shows the ignorance in so many people that really still bothers me there is still so much of that going on you 

Recording: (565/ 2140) 
you 

Recording: (566/ 2140) 
factory there is a not really there is all sorts of there is all sorts of industry in the mansfield area but there is a lot of it most of it stayed a while yeah we have got the mansfield state reformatory where shawshank redemption was recorded

Recording: (568/ 2140) 
yeah he uses a lot of different slurs towards gay people 

Recording: (569/ 2140)

Recording: (570/ 2140) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (571/ 2140) 
yes

plus the mental health aspect of it and everything 

Recording: (578/ 2140)

i do not think i would want my kid to go to daycare crazy 

Recording: (580/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (581/ 2140) 
that he remembers he remembers the stepfathers and that kind of thing it is just not a good stuff 

Recording: (582/ 2140) 
for a long period of time 

Recording: (583/ 2140) 
this poor 

Recording: (584/ 2140) 
and they are less hyper about like you know bad things for people to do you know the drinking the smoking they are just not as strict about it it basically 

Recording: (585/ 2140) 
i can not see it

really 

Recording: (589/ 2140) 
you 

Recording: (590/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (591/ 2140) 
i think it should be my way and i think the material should be there i think it should be dealt with in a calm and reasonable way and i think it should be accessible to the kids you 

Recording: (592/ 2140) 
i guess so i hope that they can keep the school somehow for kids and but it will not be him running it 

Recording: (593/ 2140) 
yeah i got a son he is a senior at audubon 

Recording: (594/ 2140)

so they get more buying power if they go there okay 

Recording: (596/ 2140) 
i it you ever try to work for something i mean you really struggled to achieve something did it mean more to you than something that was given to you tell me

no sunlight you know and they do not give him they keep it warm and he is not allowed sheets or razors or you know other than electric razors so he can not kill himself so you are stuck there is nothing you could do all day for 40 years or however until he naturally dies and that to me would be like that to me is actually like that has to be worse like just the agony and the i think you would have to go insane there is really so much you i would ask for board games or something but like he does not even hear a human voice 

Recording: (600/ 2140)

yeah 

Recording: (633/ 2140) 
civil rights only went so far they have not corrected the wrongs in the past they have not created a sense in our society that anyone can achieve like the american dream in my opinion is an absolute lie 

Recording: (634/ 2140)

Recording: (644/ 2140) 
just things like a waste of legislation money 

Recording: (645/ 2140) 
well according to government she would have 

Recording: (646/ 2140) 
that once you filter it through something it looks different but previous to that yeah there is a lot there there is way too much shared experience to gloss over effectively so when she said look if you never listen to anything else that i say you will listen to this you need to go to europe i was like ok i will go to europe 

Recording: (647/ 2140) 
she did my exwife did i would have preferred her to continue going to school but she had some problems with some students and stuff 

Recording: (648/ 2140) 
i see it as a problem and if i were african american i would not like to see it simply because because it is a child not being brought up in his tradition but on the other hand i i hate to see a child left in foster care or in an orphanage when he can have a home 

Recording: (649/ 2140) 
you ask is it okay for us to do it and now with her i can have dishes out there in the that are left there for breakfast and maybe lunch and she will walk out there and i will say well grandpa how come you are digesting that are not done and then she turns around walks away that is right uh-huh and and she may then

going to jump up and start hollering about my faith and i will not walk into a coffee shop like a lot of my friends will and sit down and start talking to people i do not feel i am ready to do that yet i think there is a place and a time for doing certain things and this is one of the biggest things that people use as a reason for faith 

Recording: (743/ 2140) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (744/ 2140) 
i teach a class on thursday nights how to play with computers i play games on tuesday nights

right 

Recording: (746/ 2140) 
here 

Recording: (747/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (748/ 2140) 
so that is why she is trying to get it out of the way now because you know the the the he makes fairly decent money so she does not have to work right now but in order for them to move up the way they want to move up you know after the baby comes she will need to work i have custody of another grandchild 

Recording: (749/ 2140) 
of all the offcampus kids to the police and so they start driving around around 1030 to try and bust them for noise on the weekends so it is pretty hectic

they are but it seems like they are going out instead of having we do not do things in hotels and things because they have inhouse 

Recording: (751/ 2140)

Recording: (752/ 2140) 
real war 

Recording: (753/ 2140) 
support her living conditions or whatever 

Recording: (754/ 2140) 
oh wow so you have it on the speed dial 

Recording: (755/ 2140) 
and then remember back on it 

Recording: (756/ 2140) 
and to learn anything it had to be the same thing over and over and over again until he got it right 

Recording: (757/ 2140) 
again they set different rules 

Recording: (758/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (759/ 2140) 
they said well since you are getting that we will cut your pay back to what you would normally draw on your apprenticeship program 

Recording: (760/ 2140) 
and that is pretty much the way i felt the whole day because i was just smiling on the inside 

Recording: (761/ 2140) 
exactly 

Recording: (762/ 2140) 
it is just there we go again who is right who is wrong i have no idea 

Recording: (763/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (764/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (765/ 2140) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (766/ 2140) 
yeah so that is pretty much what she likes to do 

Recording: (767/ 2140) 
yeah it would be just one more thing 

Recording: (768/ 2140) 
it was mostly caucasian and very few asian and other ethnicities 

Recording: (769/ 2140) 
that is not true i mean some of the older men and older tribes and different tribes 

Recording: (770/ 2140) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (771/ 2140) 
yeah but i mean that is civilizationwide 

Recording: (772/ 2140) 
yeah and yeah so i 

Recording: (773/ 2140) 
well i would sit down and talk to her like you know if you want to have sex if you really want to have sex you should get on some kind of birth control 

Recording: (774/ 2140) 
you know my husband and i were just talking about this i was saying i am not in for the you know george orwell 1984 and big brother syndrome and all my ideal situation would be that somebody decides who should have kids and who is not but i do not think god is gonna come down and do that so you know what i mean we can not really decide that but to be 

Recording: (775/ 2140) 
so it is still just sitting down on my computer sits next to it the only thing is you take it down you can only have half a desk 

Recording: (776/ 2140) 
yeah i have lived with my mom since then 

Recording: (777/ 2140) 
just one school so that is how many there was 

Recording: (778/ 2140) 
yeah and i get to argue about stuff there here i am just kind of sitting around 

Recording: (779/ 2140) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (780/ 2140) 
and we will just watch okay come on scoony he made it okay he made it in 30 seconds left he made it we win does that make the game interesting to you 

Recording: (781/ 2140) 
and i would definitely keep an eye out and figure out what is going on 

Recording: (782/ 2140) 
and i mean it is basically anytime i have free i mean it is not like i have a set schedule of when i have to work and things like that it is just whenever i feel like i have to do it 

Recording: (783/ 2140) 
then that was always her main focus 

Recording: (784/ 2140) 
yeah i went to columbus public schools always over on the west side same area of town always lived there i live there now came up here to osu got my bachelor is in english lit and then went to case western reserve for a master is then i decided i wanted to go somewhere else in the country which i got my library degree and the only job i could find was here in columbus 

Recording: (785/ 2140) 
you know and they some of them spoke out where they should speak out 

Recording: (786/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (787/ 2140) 
but she is doing fine she was dating somebody i do not know whether they really got married or not you know because i do not really have that much communication with her but some guy younger than her i talked to him he seemed like a pretty decent guy 

Recording: (788/ 2140) 
but then you will have to have people running the machinery and checking the machinery 

Recording: (789/ 2140) 
1015 minutes so yeah we stay pretty close see each other a lot 

Recording: (790/ 2140) 
and he goes do you hear me and i go yeah and he goes you got a trip be out at the airport at 430 and i go i do not know he says you hear me and i go yeah yeah he goes well get some sleep and he turns the lights off and pulls the door shut i am laying there and i have been home three hours and now i am just fuming i thought i know a college education does not guarantee you financial security but i thought what am i doing working from dawn to way past dusk six days a week and making 

Recording: (791/ 2140) 
i said i did not belong to any groups and that is not true i belong to ohio designer craftsmen and in the shops they try to limit it to ohio artists but the membership is national so it is not really closed it is just sort of focusing on ohio 

Recording: (792/ 2140) 
or do you want to run over me is that what you want to do 

Recording: (793/ 2140) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (794/ 2140) 
well yeah sort of 

Recording: (795/ 2140) 
that is 

Recording: (796/ 2140) 
no and yeah he is a mixture between forrest gump and archie bunker 

Recording: (797/ 2140) 
whether it is over exaggerated or you know none of us grew up shooting people or this you know we do not own in firearms but we played with guns and played count all these games so i just wonder whether this is really but society is a lot different now 

Recording: (798/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (799/ 2140) 
went shopping around for a new attorney it took me about seven attorneys before i found one that was adequate in terms of knowledge of head injury and brain injury because his father was a neurosurgeon and he had experience and expertise and bringing up the differences and the realities of a brain injury 

Recording: (800/ 2140) 
on 

Recording: (801/ 2140) 
huh 

Recording: (802/ 2140) 
and where my mom was a young high school student just graduating from high school they got together there moved to california 

Recording: (803/ 2140) 
but if you love someone you want them to do what is right and you want them to learn and if that is the punishment they have to pay for something they did wrong you still love them but you are loving other people also in other words you are not letting the fact this is my child so he can get away with murder but this one over here i am not going to let him get away with it no i am sorry if my child committed something that this other one would have had to pay for i am sorry you have done that dear but and i love you dearly but i try to teach you different out where you went wrong i do not want to did wrong whatever but you got to pay the penalty so 

Recording: (804/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (805/ 2140) 
you know which when you should is a better way of putting it 

Recording: (806/ 2140) 
my brother knows about it and my mother and that is the only ones in my family that are even aware of it because we just do not want to be bothered with all the questions 

Recording: (807/ 2140) 
understanding 

Recording: (808/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (809/ 2140) 
everybody lives on a farm 

Recording: (810/ 2140) 
she would pamper the kids and well from where we lived we lived just all i do not know whether you are acquainted with north end of columbus but anyway indianola avenue is one of the main thoroughfares and we lived about a block and a half off of indianola and then just another block was a small shopping center where there was a drugstore and a barber shop 

Recording: (811/ 2140) 
adhd and they do this they were trying to make it to where he would calm down and they would not have to give him so much medicine and she reads a lot of magazines and articles about you know that problem and i guess he had if you changed their diet if you take out milk or something i think it was did you know twizzlers had milk in them 

Recording: (812/ 2140) 
are not you holding it 

Recording: (813/ 2140) 
so 

Recording: (814/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (815/ 2140) 
i 

Recording: (816/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (817/ 2140) 
yeah and everybody is going to associate with people that they feel comfortable with so you know and unfortunately as that guy this guy in particular he was the center for the football team team as he grew up older you know he realized that he was not as big as important as he he blew out his knee for ou you know but i went to school with larry hunter who is the basketball coach for ou now you 

Recording: (818/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (819/ 2140) 
they did not make it into the history books yeah 

Recording: (820/ 2140) 
that encompasses the theory that all things happen for a reason even though it seems like it is chaos even though it seems like it is an accident there is a flow of spirit in this world things are moving at a pace that they are supposed to move at and things happen and death is part of life physical death and that is 

Recording: (821/ 2140) 
her husband is believe it or not they are not really i would not call them neat freaks but we tease them because my parents and her live within a couple miles of each other in dublin and you have to take off your shoes when you go in which is really it is amazing how good their carpet looks 

Recording: (822/ 2140) 
better head start on development so 

Recording: (823/ 2140) 
no because they are going to learn that on their own i personally think that it is a choice i do not think you are born that way because i have friends that are homosexual and i do not believe in what they are doing but i do not do everything right every day so i still love them and they are my friends and blah blah blah because but i have also known people that were that way and now are heterosexual and are much happier and they realize that it was just a choice they 

Recording: (824/ 2140) 
yeah they are 

Recording: (825/ 2140) 
i am not agreeing with my grandma she seems to think okay maybe but if you put a discount store in there i would love it that is what she said i was like okay 

Recording: (826/ 2140) 
right wow 

Recording: (827/ 2140) 
so yeah 

Recording: (828/ 2140) 
i wish they could 

Recording: (829/ 2140) 
man i wish i knew what to buy this week 

Recording: (830/ 2140) 
onto a house but it is just more time consuming than i think i am ready 

Recording: (831/ 2140) 
get it from us 

Recording: (832/ 2140) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (833/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (834/ 2140) 
yeah and i would not do that if i had no children 

Recording: (835/ 2140) 
so but that is you know i ended up settling the attorney got most of the money what little i had i invested some and then i made some bad investments when i went off my medication and blew it so that was my responsibility my fault that you know how it was just years of pentup frustration and i just i 

Recording: (836/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (837/ 2140) 
that is perfect 

Recording: (838/ 2140) 
yeah just one concert 

Recording: (839/ 2140) 
and i do not think that it is just executed properly so i would almost rather have it not at all 

Recording: (840/ 2140) 
i do not hear you 

Recording: (841/ 2140) 
the women really do not need the sweat lodge but it is there for them and they do participate 

Recording: (842/ 2140) 
the reason i asked was it seems to me a lot of the impetus for going to church or going back to church for people is when their kid gets old enough to go to sunday school starting asking questions about religion and you are saying well i suppose i could answer all these but yeah 

Recording: (843/ 2140) 
um no english 

Recording: (844/ 2140) 
i do not think so 

Recording: (845/ 2140) 
um 

Recording: (846/ 2140) 
cry 

Recording: (847/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (848/ 2140) 
and part of it was just being stupid but it was down around the mount vernon area and they got very little money but i was not hurt 

Recording: (849/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (850/ 2140) 
i would say and then i would also say that you know because a number of reasons that people do not vote for school levies now is because they do not have kids in the schools you know but education is the foundation of a democracy and if you do not have an educated citizenry your democracy could go down the drain that was why thomas jefferson and founded so many schools or the university of virginia and believed in education because he said without an educated citizenry you will not understand the issues 

Recording: (851/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (852/ 2140) 
with that boy 

Recording: (853/ 2140) 
mmmm 

Recording: (854/ 2140) 
groups and different cliques but i can not help but thinking that if it was bad enough that you would do something like that that it had to have been more than just normal jocks versus whatever so i think it should be more i do not know i mean even you know i went to a private 

Recording: (855/ 2140) 
and you know you have a hard thing there but then if you teach the teachers that they are not going to be quiet and they are not going to you know look at this flattery 

Recording: (856/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (857/ 2140) 
yeah it sucked 

Recording: (858/ 2140) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (859/ 2140) 
and i would not be too opposed to do that myself if it would keep the cost down around here 

Recording: (860/ 2140) 
time to go all right i am done here 

Recording: (861/ 2140) 
yeah yeah just sit on it she is not allowed on the couch but we had caught her last winter on the couch you know you come home and it is warm and hey there is a doggy bone up here 

Recording: (862/ 2140) 
it will be a long campaign i thought it was interesting that gore suggested two debates a week and i just can not imagine what you two debates a week for months at least they could get things out into the open they have the chance but who wants to watch that much who has the time to watch that much 

Recording: (863/ 2140) 
谢谢 

Recording: (864/ 2140) 
heh heh heh 

Recording: (865/ 2140)

well there was a house i did not want it so that was easy 

Recording: (870/ 2140) 
i i at one time i kind of wanted to be a teacher and everything but of course that would have been i am 49 so i would have been probably i am about 24 so i have got about 25 years in so i would be ready to get the heck out anyway 

Recording: (871/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (872/ 2140) 
so basically well yeah it might work but to me it is kind of stupid because what you are saying is we are going to take this law and we are really going to stick you on this law but to hell with all the other ones so is that really fair 

Recording: (873/ 2140) 
it was back in the 60s 

Recording: (874/ 2140) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (875/ 2140) 
i mean i do not think they should get rid of it for polaris thing but there is plenty of malls to go to if that is okay it is not a big deal to me to tell you truth no actually i live i live closer i live east more more 

Recording: (876/ 2140) 
i remember it being a pretty positive thing for me i was never upset about the fact that they were not together because they both gave me a lot of attention about i think i was maybe five or six my mom moved into apartment in german village 

Recording: (877/ 2140) 
yeah my brother well he is the oldest oldest but two sisters pretty much all the ones i really care about two sisters and their husbands 

Recording: (878/ 2140) 
more expensive so everyone has a lot less and here it is like everything is so relatively inexpensive that it is like you know picture frames or something there it might be you know $25 for one so you buy one here oh they are $5 a piece let us buy five 

Recording: (879/ 2140) 
yep 

Recording: (880/ 2140) 
you are going to cross the street you know fourlane highway and you are sitting there going 

Recording: (881/ 2140) 
around you but at night it is pretty fun and you just floor it and fly right through the middle of downtown improvements i would just say keep i would just say the man this place is dirty 

Recording: (882/ 2140) 
yeah well i think chiropractors would be more popular for the same type of reason yeah 

Recording: (883/ 2140) 
ha ha ha 

Recording: (884/ 2140) 
as he was speaking and as he started to speak i realized too another thing that i really feel has a tremendous impression on how we as people are doing here but how the politicians are is because the world in essence is getting smaller because the communication has gotten better and all these other countries and us are just like all one country anymore or something and i think that is had a tremendous influence also on our politics and on we as a people 

Recording: (885/ 2140) 
see you tomorrow i mean hold them feel the warmth of the body hear the conversation quietly rather than hearing okay time to get out of here you know with a vigorous saying but a pleasant sort of remark these kind i could elaborate i could write a whole book on that on this on the answer your questions but it is these kinds of things are very elementary really they are very elementary i guess to 

Recording: (886/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (887/ 2140) 
right right he would go for weeks he would get mad at me and not speak to me when i was growing up for a week or two at a time my mother would say please nance i changed my name when i went to college i just decided i am out of here everything is gone and so she would say nancy please just talk to your father just for my sake please talk and i would think i am the child here i should not have to to be the one to make peace in this family if he does not want to talk to me i do not need him i do not have to talk to him 

Recording: (888/ 2140) 
well it is sort of like the sociology of like clicks you know like how how that develops like how people like some people seek to like fit in like that is a real strong 

Recording: (889/ 2140) 
really yeah i do not feel old at all i mean a lot of people think wow you should know what you want to do and i guess there is different phases maslow is hierarchy what is that the hierarchy of needs maslow anyway 

Recording: (890/ 2140) 
i will not let him beat us right now 

Recording: (891/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (892/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (893/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (894/ 2140) 
well it was both really because there is kids who have lived there since i lived there that was 13 years ago and being that long in the same neighborhood just i did not really get it with me 

Recording: (895/ 2140) 
yeah from the strike yeah actually a lot of our stuff did pretty well while we were off so it did not make you feel as needed as you wanted to be we got a lot of our buildings up and running before they went on strike and i think the bosses knew this was coming so a lot of the air conditioning was already on running by then 

Recording: (896/ 2140) 
yeah exactly i know 

Recording: (897/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (898/ 2140) 
it is always been my feeling and i try to be fair in the way i grade i try to be as objective as i can sometimes i because i think it is important that people learn how to write i would ask all my classes to write an essay or a short 

Recording: (899/ 2140) 
you know 

Recording: (900/ 2140) 
yes 

Recording: (901/ 2140) 
that is pretty extreme 

Recording: (902/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (903/ 2140) 
oh gosh 

Recording: (904/ 2140) 
their ids i mean the guys are trying to look older the girls are trying to look younger 

Recording: (905/ 2140) 
or then they had to after that they had to lottery number and that was not if you were hot you know if you got your number was picked i mean i do not know what should be worse knowing that you are going to get a notice and being able to to prepare for it or because i have had friends that got numbers and everything you know and getting a high number and sitting there going oh my god 

Recording: (906/ 2140) 
it was just yeah i guess the mafia was a big problem they just take over everything and they do not pay their workers and most people are not mafias do not get paid 

Recording: (907/ 2140) 
but i do know my brotherinlaw mentioned to his parents gosh what a sacrifice you guys did for us and he is just turned 50 and they do not have any kids and he says well how you did it well for one thing they probably did a lot of sacrifice and when you sacrifice it makes you more humble 

Recording: (908/ 2140) 
the younger kids would not think anything about it 

Recording: (909/ 2140) 
a type of lifestyle and that lifestyle is gone everybody is independent everybody is going their own ways and if you happen to be lucky enough to find somebody that is looking in the same direction you are and is equally as independent then it might work but you know and who knows why each person gets divorced i mean each one of them was an individual situation 

Recording: (910/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (911/ 2140) 
the watchtowers yeah you can look it up and say has anybody got their sights on me yeah because that is it is like you know like you know that is like the world war ii stuff you know there is like remains i am sure it is like you get to see the wall it is like i mean i am sure there is like from what i understand it was like 

Recording: (912/ 2140) 
you 

Recording: (913/ 2140) 
so however this works out you know i do not know i am just like okay she just says i just want to get it over with and see now she you know 

Recording: (914/ 2140) 
oh really 

Recording: (915/ 2140) 
to be close so i did not have to drive 

Recording: (916/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (917/ 2140) 
see that is great though 

Recording: (918/ 2140) 
so i mean basically my opinion on that is just leave it up to them i mean if they want to take the risks obviously they know 

Recording: (919/ 2140) 
if you say buy buy from those unscrupulous business people they will say ah gee these guys can not have credit what happens to that person that files bankruptcy ah bankruptcy okay i will do something else next time 

Recording: (920/ 2140) 
why really think that is happening right now because i think that i do not know what the divorce statistics have been recently but i do see that more people who are getting married married are staying married because those that would have gotten a divorce they are not bothering to get married to begin with they are just living together and if they separate so what and i i think that 

Recording: (921/ 2140) 
yeah and it has the least amount of people which is kind of neat as far as tourism so 

Recording: (922/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (923/ 2140) 
i am looking for a parttime job as we speak i have been doing temporary on and off the thing with that is you can work for four or five months and then nothing and then like that so right now i am looking for something permanent 

Recording: (924/ 2140) 
you know just experiencing someone for who they are and so she is 

Recording: (925/ 2140) 
a couple restaurants or something but i mean it is different when you think of other cities you know it is more of like a downtown is where you go to hang out but here it is like campus or more of a 

Recording: (926/ 2140) 
it was just so i did not object to that one at all 

Recording: (927/ 2140) 
that would be seriously fun but it depends if you work industry you get money 

Recording: (928/ 2140) 
ride 

Recording: (929/ 2140) 
well i 

Recording: (930/ 2140) 
and they were just wild you know i just ran every minute and i took it as a substitute and did not know from day to day you know whether it was going to keep it i finally had to say i can not do this 27 kindergartens i am sorry i can not do this by myself 

Recording: (931/ 2140) 
me or 

Recording: (932/ 2140) 
yeah drugs right yeah so that is what she is interested in right now she is looking to see if she can find some place to work this summer even if it is just a day a week some clinic or something just to see what goes on day to day 

Recording: (933/ 2140) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (934/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (935/ 2140) 
that is bishop reedy it is a catholic school over on the west side 

Recording: (936/ 2140) 
and i just told them what it has to do with my belief system so you are in violation of the first amendment and then they realized that i was not stupid so you know they just made things more and more difficult for me so i just decided to since they were not going to change i was just going to leave so it is a hard way to choose to walk if you are an idealistic person 

Recording: (937/ 2140) 
is it any worse than baseball cards 

Recording: (938/ 2140) 
and you said divorce is more acceptable divorce should never be acceptable 

Recording: (939/ 2140) 
yeah i had a cousin that went on she was in school for that and as you can tell i like to do office work 

Recording: (940/ 2140) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (941/ 2140) 
yeah that is how he gets so much money he says i will be paid this much and i will be given this much minimum per day or i am not working for you and they usually say no no no we will not do that and then they will call back a week later ok we will take you he has some really good stories about that oh yeah he just has qualifications with running businesses is that why he has qualifications with businesses and also with unix which is 

Recording: (942/ 2140) 
hmm 

Recording: (943/ 2140) 
a lot more places to live it seems like everywhere i turn there is construction and you know you go down one road and then you wait a couple years if you do not go in that area and it is all changed it looks all different so and that is mainly like looking up bethel and 315 or things like that 

Recording: (944/ 2140) 
you know he was in oh yeah they both worked during college i guess my dad was on the gi bill after the war so that is how he got in here and had to work some parttime work to get his degree it is just east broad street just franklin park conservative 

Recording: (945/ 2140) 
i mean that goes along with my customs and beliefs i mean we are going to send our child i already know to parochial schools there is no way i am going to send him to a public school and even my husband is a boy scout leader and just listening to the boys there he did a last night on respect 

Recording: (946/ 2140) 
the ultimate would probably be a parttime thing but neither one of our positions offer any type of parttime work we have some friends that do that where they only go two days a week or something which is they get a little bit of both the world so 

Recording: (947/ 2140) 
do i think they will oh yes i think they definitely will i think there is so much heavy political and financial well i am going to reverse that statement there is so much heavy financial influence upon the political influence that it is almost a foregone conclusion and if it does not occur within this year and there may be another vote in another year or next election but i think that in fact it will go 

Recording: (948/ 2140) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (949/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (950/ 2140) 
you know 

Recording: (951/ 2140) 
yeah that is what i am saying 

Recording: (952/ 2140) 
yeah yeah they have had two different articles in there about it well they had a big article back when it was a jesse jackson was down there or something a couple years ago or something and he made a concerted effort to try to let people know how much poverty is there down there and everything but then you go to a lot of other extremes you know where you sit there and these people would not want to live in columbus so 

Recording: (953/ 2140) 
i think he is done some positive things that whole thing about as far as your student loans and being able to get into scala which has helped me as far as some of the issues go i feel pretty similar to the way he does i think i have gone pretty decently but i mean i think i do not know i mean i do not 

Recording: (954/ 2140) 
yeah from what i hear actually like the emory and the university of chicago you have to work really hard because they get all the kids who wish they would have gotten to harvard and then start you know try to make it up by working harder you get to actual harvard nobody works because they are like we already made it you know 

Recording: (955/ 2140) 
i well that is a that is a tough one i remember when you know when we were we had you know some movies like but they were like the bowery boys and stuff you know where you pretty much knew it was all fake anyway you know but and to me that is fake and i never really thought about while i was growing up that it was what was real and everything i always knew that by i dare again you know by my dad being a 

Recording: (956/ 2140) 
he is a disappointment 

Recording: (957/ 2140) 
right right 

Recording: (958/ 2140) 
we will do this and we will do this so we checked out the catholic school and they were organized that way and it just was a better match for him and then my daughter went to school it was just easier to take him to the same school and that goes back to another thing i wanted to say about why the discipline and behavior may be different in the catholic school is you are paying big bucks you know it is $4500 a year for us to send her to school you 

Recording: (959/ 2140) 
yeah i figure right now i might as well take advantage of it 

Recording: (960/ 2140) 
yes 

Recording: (961/ 2140) 
businessmen my dad and i have been screwing around with stocks for years i have been in contact with a day trading firm down in west virginia and they are starting an intern program sometime i do not even know win but if that opens up i will probably seriously consider going down to west virginia i have been saying west virginia have not i they are in virginia sorry their home base is in richmond virginia 

Recording: (962/ 2140) 
year and then i went into the army in 1940 spring of 1941 before pearl harbor i was in service for four and a half years in italy most of that time north africa and then italy and i had met a girl before i went into service 

Recording: (963/ 2140) 
then when i found out there were so many openings in special ed so and then i found out later that speech therapy is a very good background for ld because a lot of these ld kids have language deficits and language problems they can not express themselves on paper or they do not process things correctly auditorily so that is the perfect background to work with ld kids i did not know i was doing that at the time 

Recording: (964/ 2140) 
i made a difference 

Recording: (965/ 2140) 
that is great 

Recording: (966/ 2140) 
yes and no when we were in boy scouts we got kicked out of it 

Recording: (967/ 2140) 
and well the people that own it are starting to build it up now but it is been like that it was the first apartment community in columbia it was built in 38 i guess 

Recording: (968/ 2140) 
people that lived there we have got the indian department stores right down there on high street and a couple of asian groceries i do not know where they live i mean it seems like for those stores to be opening there they must be somewhere in clintonville but i do not know 

Recording: (969/ 2140) 
all right 

Recording: (970/ 2140) 
huh 

Recording: (971/ 2140) 
i do not know i would not personally like think that the parents should be held responsible i mean they do have you know a certain amount of responsibility for the fact that they should have been more aware and especially because i mean i believe that those at least one of the two had been in counseling and was doing aggression management or something like that you know you would think that if they were going through something like that you would just sort of you know maybe 

Recording: (972/ 2140) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (973/ 2140) 
once the tourists hear about it you know it is like you know 

Recording: (974/ 2140) 
mmm 

Recording: (975/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (976/ 2140) 
well basically it is the same thing here but some of your management is real good i have seen people that are super but i have seen people that are bad the problem is you get a bad management and it can make your life hell i do not care who you are 

Recording: (977/ 2140) 
all you do is you just keep your records of what you spend on things and then there is a form you fill out and how much you have if you have taken any depreciation you need to basically put that back in and deduct your cost and then there is a percentage that goes on your schedule e that goes on the front of your form that goes into your income and then it is just taxed it is just it is really not that hard 

Recording: (978/ 2140) 
the 

Recording: (979/ 2140) 
yeah i am just learning the area but i like it so far it seems really nice it seems like there is a lot more to do in columbus obviously but 

Recording: (980/ 2140) 
why do i think that is 

Recording: (981/ 2140) 
everyone might experiment or try or make a mistake but the way he is handling it saying i am not even gonna dignify that question over and over and over if he did not do it he might as well just be like no i did not do it 

Recording: (982/ 2140) 
downtown which is where one of my orchestras plays a lot we sang in other different kinds of churches and said what we liked about them and what we did not maybe it had some feedback i think the new building is acoustically very good it is certainly much better than the old building old worship center because i do not know if you have seen a picture or anything of the church but the old worship center was designed by a modern architect to 

Recording: (983/ 2140) 
at this point i am not against the urban schools but if it was my own personal child i would merge move to a suburban area until columbus gets their act together they are in such bad shape right now that i do think the state will take over the columbus public schools in two years yeah they have threatened it and if they do not pull their scores up they will you know 

Recording: (984/ 2140) 
and move on that is basically my fear but as one of the guys tried to help me said well listen i am afraid of that too because right there in that pit there that is god now if you remember that there is nothing in here that can hurt you even as hot as it gets you know and when you think about that you try not to think too much while you are in there although 

Recording: (985/ 2140) 
or they come back to visit me sometimes from the high school 

Recording: (986/ 2140) 
yeah it is ridiculous plus it is a nationally recognized school so a degree from ohio state i mean you could go anywhere in the nation someone is at least going to recognize it because it is a big it is a big big name ashland it would be more of a sell i would be like okay we it is small it is private it is credited but still 

Recording: (987/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (988/ 2140) 
it does not matter how much money they are given for their education 

Recording: (989/ 2140) 
yeah i think mostly they did i was kind of surprised which class was this i think this was in that introduction to the arts class i was kind of surprised that one of the students in my class thought it was very hard i did not think it was that hard at all but she wrote me some kind of nasty you know at the last class or before the last class that she had a straight a average at the school before my class and i was giving her a b and she was her 

Recording: (990/ 2140) 
he is proud of the fact that he did not cook 

Recording: (991/ 2140) 
i do not know where he got the contact but anyway he went up to boone iowa and joined the national guard out which was field artillery and with the expectation of their being mobilized soon which they were and so he was home one weekend and talked to me about it and i went on field artillery i was exposed to that when i was in rotc at ames so i thought let us be better than carrying 

Recording: (992/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (993/ 2140) 
enough kids out there that need love 

Recording: (994/ 2140) 
but when it came down to it what was the protest really about i am not being clear because i am not exactly sure where i am going with this i am very cynical about the world i have inherited because i see a world in which my political views have been silenced by 50 years of international politics and propaganda 

Recording: (995/ 2140) 
i went to let me see i applied to emory harvard duke university of chicago and washington university so i got into three of those they were neat places 

Recording: (996/ 2140) 
i have no idea 

Recording: (997/ 2140) 
oh yes 

Recording: (998/ 2140) 
yeah he was up there too the old guy with the beard and the tweed jacket it was pretty cool and they said most of students are not even from delaware 

Recording: (999/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (1000/ 2140) 
right right that is the amazing thing about this country is that there is enough space in the united states and north america that you can have all these incredible monstrosity developments and still be able to find relatively wild places between them 

Recording: (1001/ 2140) 
something to think about 

Recording: (1002/ 2140) 
yeah it is spring break a couple of teachers are taking a bunch of kids 

Recording: (1003/ 2140) 
you know they should not know where the keys are if there were keys to the gun cabinet or whatever i mean the fact that you know how do you explain your way out of your kids taking guns to school 

Recording: (1004/ 2140) 
i 

Recording: (1005/ 2140) 
they what they 

Recording: (1006/ 2140) 
he is an educator which is all the more reason to homeschool because he sees it and he is like yeah they 

Recording: (1007/ 2140) 
that is going to well it might make national news i just 

Recording: (1008/ 2140) 
that is my dad has red hair and blue eyes so 

Recording: (1009/ 2140) 
okay so um chris and i spent the rest of the evening calling people i got it in my head that i did not want anybody to call and say how is your dad doing and so the best way to deal with that situation was to call globally across the board plus it was a fun psychological experiment just as they go because how often do you get to tell people that the dude that just killed himself this morning so i am like hi how you doing no i have not talked to you 

Recording: (1010/ 2140) 
well see he moved into an apartment over on 11th avenue

mmhmm 

Recording: (1022/ 2140) 
breastfeeding there was a lot of that i think it is all these poor guys are like oh we not talk about this you know they are all kind of uncomfortable 

Recording: (1023/ 2140) 
i said you know i do not know why you are insecure i said everything you do you do well i said i try things and just bomb at them and i said you just zip through them and i said you maybe someday when you are older you will look back and go oh i see what dad was talking about but she just can not see that 

Recording: (1024/ 2140) 
i am just kind of appalled at what they put on the news anyway it is not usually what i consider news it is a lot of human interest stories and things like that which 

Recording: (1025/ 2140) 
so many normal people in 

Recording: (1026/ 2140) 
i would not like it to be that way but basically when i was in the service the women had their own area of the service that they were allowed to be nurses and stuff you know

mmhmm i did 

Recording: (1032/ 2140) 
one of the bathrooms right now is a jacuzzi that is not really too hard but the hardest thing to do is electrical work i think it is just because it is more intimidating you 

Recording: (1033/ 2140) 
you know 

Recording: (1034/ 2140) 
no not at all i think in the united states it is the driving force of our government a necessarily a bad thing when the unions were really strong i thought i was reading about it i thought that was a good thing as well because 

Recording: (1035/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (1036/ 2140) 
and teresa the founder also realizes that if you can break that cycle through the children so the focus and the emphasis was really on the children

Recording: (1153/ 2140) 
they saw us have difficult times and they saw us our spouses crying together forgiving one another arguing with another just as much as you do you can have being in a human relationship they saw that they saw the love for one another they saw overnight where i would start caring for my dad because my mother died instantly like short term an hour and now he had a stroke i did not know whether i saved other lives and i had to learn all that and 

Recording: (1154/ 2140)

Recording: (1171/ 2140)

bring what is in your heart out and sometimes you will say stuff that does not even make sense but you say it and it brings it out and that is what it is for so i mean it is it is a struggle understanding that and i made it through all four rounds this time and i even sat up which was the first time it is a struggle but 

Recording: (1179/ 2140)

if you were not here well he was the first capital punishment case in ohio in 20 or 25 years or something like that he had killed somebody and he was on death row and he wanted to be executed and i thought that is a cop out if there ever was one just to get him a lethal injection and let him go he should have rotted in prison for it no that is not true 

Recording: (1191/ 2140) 
i wish they would clean it up more often no it is not sprawling out from where i am i do not live in the suburbs area so i mean i live i live right in the middle of all the houses that have been there for 60 or 70 years and i am smack dab in the middle of all the frats and sororities on campus so i am like yeah it is fine spreads out fine i just think it is funny i would love to get a good nice

Recording: (1196/ 2140) 
that is that whatever they call it 33 that is on the ballot 

Recording: (1197/ 2140) 
so i hesitate to say that it would really help them it would just be better if somebody could keep their eyes open or if we had more counselors or things like that like that to deal with everything including that

you know at lunchtime they would be cutting their next class you know there is two different lunchtimes sometimes they just alternate and take two lunches or go to one class go to one lunch and skip after then 

Recording: (1225/ 2140) 
yeah they really like it they have a huge house in the middle of nowhere out on a farm my brotherinlaw bought his father is wendy is business is out and so they own like six wendy is out there so but it is out in the middle of nowhere that was the whole problem he tried to get him to move and tried to get him to do this years and years ago and nobody wanted to move to nebraska he was doing them from ohio which is really tough running five wendy is in 

Recording: (1226/ 2140) 
and 

Recording: (1227/ 2140) 
and we were staying at his grandpa is and his grandpa would sit on the back porch and say all kinds of racial slurs towards black people 

Recording: (1228/ 2140) 
but 

Recording: (1229/ 2140) 
to turn on the news they do not really cover my husband comes from a journalistic background and he will be like that is not news you know what i mean it is just we get so let us here and watch a plane crash for 12 hours instead of watching i do not know what little house on the prairie i do not know i am being facetious but yeah you know what i mean 

Recording: (1230/ 2140) 
it is like it is um it is like there is flyers and stuff that you see or whatever and you get directions to it and it will be in a bunch you know there is a bunch of different places will be in you know like a sports arena or something or it depends how big there i mean there is ones where there is like 200 people there is ones really like five there is ones for their thousand there is ones where they are like three thousand and like there is ones in canada i did not i did not go to one but some of my friends went to it where there is like 15000 people there 

Recording: (1231/ 2140) 
like i am learning more about the environment because of this job but i would like to do something otherwise like a lot of like business leaders they become very conservative when they get higher up because of the tax breaks they want to support things like that but i think there should be a good mix 

Recording: (1232/ 2140) 
to get bags of apples and chicken sandwiches and apple juice but then here comes cooper is wife and his daughter and like his i am thinking they are putting all his family up in this hotel the night before a game i do not know i just thought it was very strange that he would have his whole family staying there with him when none of those boys get to bring anybody you know what i mean 

Recording: (1233/ 2140) 
there is a huge wind tunnel yeah 

Recording: (1234/ 2140) 
i have a very general opposition to this kind of thing no matter where it is anymore my being 76 years of age has a major you are bearing because i see the total destruction of our center cities and i say when i speak of center cities i do not necessarily mean just cities the size of columbus which is the largest one in the state of ohio now but i am talking places like washington courthouse which maybe have 15000 or 

Recording: (1235/ 2140) 
yes i did 

Recording: (1236/ 2140) 
mm 

Recording: (1237/ 2140) 
the government is always good for money 

Recording: (1238/ 2140) 
it is kind of like a 

Recording: (1239/ 2140) 
i still think i will baptize in my fires but i guess you survived okay because you are here you are still teaching 

Recording: (1240/ 2140) 
yeah like a little kid and he did not say anything to me but he made my aunt feel like a little pile of dirt sister and so he just really showed out that day but what is so funny is our baby my dad has red hair and our baby has red hair 

Recording: (1241/ 2140) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (1242/ 2140) 
our janitor is worthless basically we were complaining about it earlier during the year three formal complaints have been filed against him and he still refuses to pay is to change the bleach water like more than once a week it is just really disgusting so we had these temps come in one day and it was we went in like we are in shock it was so clean 

Recording: (1243/ 2140) 
mmhmm yeah it is an old eye sore that they should have got rid of years ago 

Recording: (1244/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1245/ 2140) 
one thing i was thinking that i have a perspective on that maybe lots of people do not is how columbus is grown up 

Recording: (1246/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1247/ 2140) 
and i do not know if it is quite that bad but it was certainly some things that he is been doing that are not proved up and i am not real up on that 

Recording: (1248/ 2140) 
i am living over on iucaa if you on the other side of high street you know the mcdonald is right by high street it is like 

Recording: (1249/ 2140) 
i think that is too young to talk about birth control methods and everything but with aids and as rampant as it is now and there is so many more women that have it start off it was mostly men women have got to know at an early age about these different diseases and things 

Recording: (1250/ 2140) 
right it is bad it is bad on the other hand it is not good to let your mind wander off somewhere i find myself having to focus sometimes i mean to really 

Recording: (1251/ 2140) 
i like management here 

Recording: (1252/ 2140) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1253/ 2140) 
mhm 

Recording: (1254/ 2140) 
the reds more so than indians back my younger days because they were not worth a damn but 

Recording: (1255/ 2140) 
oh yeah i would say so 

Recording: (1256/ 2140) 
i was in 78 and then i have just i have stayed there and it is grown a lot and the work chain it is an interesting place to work because well first the job is almost a different job every year because so many changes are happening stay out in front of what library innovations in front of web and net innovations and try to incorporate it all 

Recording: (1257/ 2140) 
but one time i read somewhere that a mexican lady who came across the border to have her baby and they put the little band on and they wrote female and then they wrote her last name she said to her husband when he came over to see her well they have already named her look famali 

Recording: (1258/ 2140) 
and he always said well i am so allergic but then he did not have any problems 

Recording: (1259/ 2140) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1260/ 2140) 
yeah i hear 

Recording: (1261/ 2140) 
but 

Recording: (1262/ 2140) 
well how he felt and knowing that we were not neglecting him are two different things we have always emphasized that knowing what is right or knowing that what is just is one thing is dealing with the emotions is another one 

Recording: (1263/ 2140) 
but he just did not have a very high opinion of the army 

Recording: (1264/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (1265/ 2140) 
yeah well he thinks he can do it 

Recording: (1266/ 2140) 
wow 

Recording: (1267/ 2140) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1268/ 2140) 
i want i do not want somebody i want them to be able to feel like they can punish him and they can pray and they can 

Recording: (1269/ 2140) 
mhm 

Recording: (1270/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1271/ 2140) 
uh but i like it when they are new york it is all real loud there is like cars and sirens in the background and stuff or when people uh and i think that is the she was telling me about she was getting like some bedroom set or something like that like some sheets or something and she was like asking me if it would go with her wallpaper and stuff and she was like she was like describing it to me like alright this has a green trim with like a flowers design she is like do you think this like blue will accent it or something i am like yeah sure whatever like 

Recording: (1272/ 2140) 
the father less respect for the mother less respect for the grandparents and the greatgrandparents i am going to give you a firsthand example i just had a conversation with one of my granddaughters who is now 20 she will come over to my house grandpa is house and and she will come in and she will flop down in a chair and she will do nothing in that household even if you suggest it 

Recording: (1273/ 2140) 
to be let go i mean that is an awfully small price to pay for 

Recording: (1274/ 2140) 
you 

Recording: (1275/ 2140) 
like right now their biggest campaign is some elementary school i believe no i think it is a high school in marion was built on an old weapons depot and so like leukemia has risen and so like that is their main campaign now is to inform the public and try and get that changed they have also done other things other they do anything dealing with the environment like exposure things like that 

Recording: (1276/ 2140) 
i do not know how to tell you that 

Recording: (1277/ 2140) 
fact that that is the only thing i felt difficult about about living there was they would be asking all these incredible questions and i would be trying to do the dishes or something mundane like that it is like i do not want to do the dishes i just want to answer the questions 

Recording: (1278/ 2140) 
conscientious that there are 

Recording: (1279/ 2140) 
well somehow or other yeah and if everybody would just begin to build that way and when they start to say something nasty you would think would i want them to say that to me 

Recording: (1280/ 2140) 
yeah it was just like there was a lot of people there who you know like their parents were farmers and or they they were whatever you know it was like like preppy kids or like hick type kids you know 

Recording: (1281/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1282/ 2140) 
everybody needs to know that information for credit cards 

Recording: (1283/ 2140) 
and go back and ask them as i would ask my english teacher in school anybody that said well what did this poet what was his he wrote this poem and i gave my interpretation no no no that was not it they would share their thought i know that was he is been dead 

Recording: (1284/ 2140) 
feel you can not put a value on a human life there were just subtle things that my sense of taste and smell was gone for about a year and a half just all the trauma that goes along with it not just the physical trauma i mean that was enough to kill anybody but because of me because of my size because of my strength i was not killed you 

Recording: (1285/ 2140) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1286/ 2140) 
mmm 

Recording: (1287/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (1288/ 2140) 
fort hayes 

Recording: (1289/ 2140) 
ha ha ha ha 

Recording: (1290/ 2140) 
how can you do that 

Recording: (1291/ 2140) 
the pizza is really cheap 

Recording: (1292/ 2140) 
connecting some wires are crossed up here or something and so they become very distrustful of adults because all their life people have been saying 

Recording: (1293/ 2140) 
yeah well the white man would probably win but the black man also has a better chance than the woman i think 

Recording: (1294/ 2140) 
mmhmm yeah 

Recording: (1295/ 2140) 
yeah so 

Recording: (1296/ 2140) 
have 

Recording: (1297/ 2140) 
like a girlfriend is mind 

Recording: (1298/ 2140) 
i do not know i like the story 

Recording: (1299/ 2140) 
it was columbus he went to fort hayes 

Recording: (1300/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (1301/ 2140) 
getting electrocuted or something yeah that just does not appeal to me too much but i mean it is really not too difficult i mean as long as you are careful and 

Recording: (1302/ 2140) 
yeah it says 

Recording: (1303/ 2140) 
well like a million miles down to the south end or something like that but you just punch in your numbers always you just talk with numbers it is interesting to add on 

Recording: (1304/ 2140) 
so i am like 

Recording: (1305/ 2140) 
and you saw very impoverished areas 

Recording: (1306/ 2140) 
i play with computers normally when people ask me i tell them what i did that day or what i did the day before if they ask me in the evening so what did i do today internet information server is a product by microsoft it lets you house web pages and put them out on the web on the web indexserve is another product that lets you put search engines on that then there is another product by a company called splitcycle it is called netstock it sucks netstock 

Recording: (1307/ 2140) 
i know well to me the cholesterol level and the health from that food has got to be so bad i mean my only downfall is i love taco bell so when i am like working out in the yard and mowing and edging and trimming and wash the car and i would look at my watch and i would go oh hell i deserve a break i am going out to lunch well most people would go somewhere really expensive i would go what i want a mexican pizza and a coke 

Recording: (1308/ 2140) 
well 

Recording: (1309/ 2140) 
i can not even go out and sign that long i have had melanoma cancer and stuff so i sold my boat now mainly my hobby is just tinkering around stuff buy a car fix it up and sell it 

Recording: (1310/ 2140) 
have you ever been there 

Recording: (1311/ 2140) 
okay so you are higher up there than i would be 

Recording: (1312/ 2140) 
obviously it is not something new that is been coming around i mean it is been around for a long time 

Recording: (1313/ 2140) 
mhm 

Recording: (1314/ 2140) 
yeah that is it 

Recording: (1315/ 2140) 
i helped them set up different things helped them clean them up afterwards prep patients all kinds of different things that was a lot of blood and stuff i do not know when it is not you it seems a little easier to observe i guess when you see somebody you know it is a little more concerning to you i do not know but you see a lot of different stuff and you hope that the majority of it is helping this person out now my wife you know 

Recording: (1316/ 2140) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1317/ 2140) 
and so they went up there but the germans caught on pretty quick and they made it pretty hot and that area of enzio was just flat as this rock stable almost for an area back from the mediterranean back probably ten miles ten or twelve miles well along the coast along and so we had enough area to many people 

Recording: (1318/ 2140) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1319/ 2140) 
you her move in with them they were her temporary foster parents and she just turned 16 so she was 15 when she moved in with them she refused to used to change and i do not know what could have changed it if they would have got her out earlier but basically all three of them 

Recording: (1320/ 2140) 
i travel across the state and country and before that i was always traveling to fall semester back time of semester not quarters and we would get on a greyhound bus 15 hour pass and buddy and i would just travel all over the country and sleep in the bus at night

mmhmm 

Recording: (1330/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1331/ 2140) 
right i think teaching band might be fun because i think you only ever got a satisfactory or unsatisfactory in band and it had mostly to do with whether you were there whether you were well behaved yeah and whether you are trying to play your instrument i do not think we ever got a is b is and c is yeah 

Recording: (1332/ 2140) 
i have no problem with a man being with a man or a woman being with a woman but if that was the relationship for everybody 

Recording: (1333/ 2140) 
i feel like i have friends and when we say oh we are going out to the bar like we all know which bar because there is only one that college students go to 

Recording: (1334/ 2140)

Recording: (1338/ 2140) 
yeah yeah i do not know but then they second guess the mother and she risked her life they can not do that i mean you know it is too bad that that she was not there to go on with what they were planning on doing but it is not our right to take other countries kids even i mean that is another thing come to america we will take everyone and everything but then we have all this crime because we have all these terrorist people that come from i mean that is all they have grown up with 

Recording: (1339/ 2140)

Recording: (1350/ 2140)

Recording: (1351/ 2140) 
just just kind of instincts i guess yeah actually there are quite a there is a well pretty wellknown doctor that has a ton of books and i go to la leche league and that is kind of their philosophy in a way yeah just that breastfeeding is you know a way to mother and 

Recording: (1352/ 2140) 
mbc 뉴스 김수진입니다 

Recording: (1353/ 2140) 
yeah that is kind of fun 

Recording: (1354/ 2140) 
you 

Recording: (1355/ 2140) 
i would not have been smiling from down there to up here when he dropped me off he did not even know 

Recording: (1356/ 2140) 
williams freshman year and every single one of them was accurate it was really really really funny william will lose something expensive by the end of the year and i had my bike stolen william will either grow in his faith significantly or will go exact opposite direction i knew one way or another what happened because my roommate my freshman year for the first quarter was a drug dealer oh 

Recording: (1357/ 2140) 
well i agree that we should help them maybe through some sort of government program but i think what really hurts them the most is the people that actually give them the money on on with it because it is really easy life 

Recording: (1358/ 2140) 
you 

Recording: (1359/ 2140) 
not on airplanes but on heating and cooling systems 

Recording: (1360/ 2140) 
it is a lot of the it looks look and feel is a lot the same 

Recording: (1361/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1362/ 2140) 
and then how satisfying is that to them when you have a chance to talk to them that is where we need to learn more from interview have more meaningful interviews with these people that we can learn from them they put them in the spotlight but we somehow we just do not want to i guess flood them with the we do not want to get the negative answer because it might hurt the image of the university oh gee no who was it katzenmaier or something 

Recording: (1363/ 2140) 
and they are very into capitalism and their lives are working pretty good for them 

Recording: (1364/ 2140) 
mmhmm yeah because they think they are grown they think they are grown and they are like 12 and 13 and they have been having sex since they were 10 it is just like and yeah and they are having babies earlier and earlier and it is just really scary 

Recording: (1365/ 2140) 
anything else is a hardware failure and you would have to go fix it somewhere else anyway so if you know how to put an operating system on your machine you can start over if you can start over there is no reason to be scared of anything that you do problem number one in playing with computers for most people is being afraid that they are going to break something 

Recording: (1366/ 2140) 
i am trying to come up with like a narrative that is both fun and brief okay so my friend chris and i are upstairs playing on the computer and my sister is downstairs watching television it is sunday morning and i am trying to figure out how this game works trying to figure out how this game works and then i said i have got some information on this game out in the car i am gonna go get it 

Recording: (1367/ 2140) 
fry 

Recording: (1368/ 2140) 
you know there is things about my dad that i would not want to live with he is great and he is wonderful to me i mean my dad is really wonderful to me but i mean things like when my mom had me he did not pick her up from the hospital i mean it is that kind of stuff that you think what the hell were you thinking 

Recording: (1369/ 2140) 
such an idea and that indeed is going to take away from family in my way of thinking i can not imagine that i would have my wife producing somebody else is child over here and i am going to have the same thank you that is exactly fatherly love fatherly value fatherly instincts toward war 

Recording: (1370/ 2140) 
ha ha ha ha 

Recording: (1371/ 2140) 
exactly huge 

Recording: (1372/ 2140) 
hmm 

Recording: (1373/ 2140) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1374/ 2140) 
i am still in it 

Recording: (1375/ 2140) 
oh my god 

Recording: (1376/ 2140) 
and we would adjust the guns call down shifts so they could come within reasonable close to that 

Recording: (1377/ 2140) 
and a tencent store theater i forget a couple other shops and when orrin was about i do not know five or maybe six or seven years old he had been explicitly told that he was not to go up there at all so one day grandma gave him i do not know a quarter 

Recording: (1378/ 2140) 
so 

Recording: (1379/ 2140) 
the problem is like say every airline wants to go to new york city and they want all their businessmen there at 8 am well an airport has so many runways and so many taxiways and like say ten airplanes every ten minutes can come in and out of those airports they end up shooting like 30 there so instead of letting them all get in the air and stand up there and hold while they are shooting them in what they do is they will 

Recording: (1380/ 2140) 
all of them the university is divided up in different areas and there is a shop within each area that takes care of all the maintenance needs for those areas about 20 buildings or so ours is in the northeast area from wexner down through the oval to i do not know about derby or so around in there and then on over to woodruff 

Recording: (1381/ 2140) 
oh yeah there is always people out there 

Recording: (1382/ 2140) 
i took a class for word processing 1 and 2 i took those i tell you truth i can not remember if they taught me how to balance a checkbook out 

Recording: (1383/ 2140) 
yeah i thought in the beginning i missed mirror lake cafe so bad said the good subs and all that i do not i do not know why i missed them i do not i go back and now i just do not like it anymore 

Recording: (1384/ 2140) 
it is a pretty dangerous drug i would say for the most part not so much the getting high part of it but just what goes into it 

Recording: (1385/ 2140) 
i am not 

Recording: (1386/ 2140) 
this 

Recording: (1387/ 2140) 
there is very definitely 

Recording: (1388/ 2140) 
you know with the computer and everything he is a really good handyman he can do anything so he is really helped me he is really into design and stuff stuff so he likes to paint and he is really open he is learned a lot about gardening from me and that is one of my main things is gardening you 

Recording: (1389/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1390/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1391/ 2140) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1392/ 2140) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1393/ 2140) 
yeah exactly so you know once you get to a certain degree of frustration and you need to relieve that somehow so that is pretty much why we moved 

Recording: (1394/ 2140) 
really 

Recording: (1395/ 2140) 
from our friends that have gone their discipline is expelling the child from school well they are expelling them to a home where the parents were where they are just getting three days of free play i mean pretty much to get in trouble and cause more trouble they really are not learning from that 

Recording: (1396/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (1397/ 2140) 
well yeah i think it is real important to really get a good feel for how you are and all your beliefs and all that they have to really match and if they do not then it is not ever going to work because there is always going to be conflict and friction and all that kind of thing so i think it is real important and there is no age limit on that to when you really feel good about yourself and you really know what you want to do then that is the only time that you can really commit and say yeah we 

Recording: (1398/ 2140) 
yeah i think basically normal hours would be like 8 to 12 and then you go home during lunchtime because that is the big meal of the day you go home and eat with your family that is really important 

Recording: (1399/ 2140) 
on sunday 

Recording: (1400/ 2140) 
i never knew they had so many beaches i mean i know they had a good reputation you know for like just having a great vacation time because nobody ever came back from australia and said the place was terrible the weather was bad people were rude everybody said you have got to go you have got to go it is a long flight but it is well worth the time the city of sioux falls we are 

Recording: (1401/ 2140) 
i think they lost i think ohio state lost because they was just out there ranting and raving and after a while it got out of hand 

Recording: (1402/ 2140) 
well that is probably the roof right there 

Recording: (1403/ 2140)

Recording: (1661/ 2140) 
so yes in my opinion definitely it is eroding i know you took a little different approach in answering the question from over the time that this kind of thing is eroding based upon the word respect i have always been the kind of person to leave i never told my kids not to do something i ca not do it this age somebody can at another age possibly like go out on a date for example well he is going out to a party like i have well he is already 16 years old but i mean i never did well i will not give you any examples but anyway if i told them they could not do it i would try them swearing is one of my bad habits and i know that i would try to i got taught one time that i better watch a little more carefully by my own little girl if they did catch me doing something that i would be telling them no you cannot do i would apologize and say mommy was bad and mommy did that i got sick of my mouth one time because of it well that is really admirable oh no i mean if you want to hear the story it is funny well the tv just i was baking pie and i was taking this pie out of the oven it was a cherry pie or an apple pie i said i like to sit there for a minute before i take it out i take it on out and sit on top of it well mommy said a bad word i guess that mommy has to have soap in her mouth does not she i get to put soap in your mouth i said yep i said yep you caught mommy saying a bad word

Recording: (1673/ 2140) 
i think the divorce rate has gone up because it is more socially acceptable i am sure there is plenty of people 20 years ago that would have loved to have gotten a divorce had that been an option i think a lot of it depends on the way you handle it how you handle it after the divorce is final do you see what does that make any sense at all 

Recording: (1674/ 2140) 
uh i mean obviously it is something that happens every day and things like that uh like said by no means my saying you go president clinton and i think that but i mean i can not say i would hold it against him for doing something like that i mean it is nothing that threatened the nation or whatever

Recording: (1983/ 2140)

oh well we really wants to go he lived in california that is where that family i told you about was the and when he was 14 or 16 and he really wants to go back back so we will probably end up there sometime but after i finish school and after he works for a little while and i work so that we can have enough money i mean we do not need to have a ton but we just should be at least a little out of debt yeah something 

Recording: (2011/ 2140) 
neither side is going to do anything about it somebody should have did something about that because then you know they would have been doing doing what they were supposed to do to make him you know get in line and so he knew hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei

oh well 

Recording: (2016/ 2140) 
right and just going over it and over it and over it 

Recording: (2017/ 2140) 
and they might be something as easy as what are the three colors in our flag or how much do you have to have of the senate to pass a law you know it could be something real real technical or something that a threeyearold could answer because it is trying to hit all the areas that you have learned 

Recording: (2018/ 2140) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (2019/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (2020/ 2140) 
so he did it well he is always had some problems his problem i am saying focused on things unless it is something he is extremely interested in then you can not get him away from it if it is something he it is just an example in school he would sit there and he would be rolling around on the floor and stuff while they are trying to teach something in class or it is working on a writing assignment or something they have a half hour to work on a 

Recording: (2021/ 2140) 
it took us 10 years to have and i think my mom generally thought i was doing birth control and we were not but you always knew the sublateral tones undertones you know is she or is not she i was just like well i am not going to discuss it with her because i knew that was a no no to her but i was not but you need to know that 

Recording: (2022/ 2140) 
you know they all get sidelined and sidetracked by special and private interests and that is the bottom line and it is sad but there is so i choose not to involve myself and that as much as possible we ended up settling for 

Recording: (2023/ 2140) 
what i have liked so much about it is they tell you everything and then you find out that it is not right and that is wrong i mean there was the episode 

Recording: (2024/ 2140) 
because there is some people that actually can not work 

Recording: (2025/ 2140) 
mmm 

Recording: (2026/ 2140)

Recording: (2028/ 2140) 
and eventually get my own business where i have a want that i want to get a spiritual bookstore and have things for everybody you know just come in and reading room browse you know read this stuff you know take time off to relax because i think one of the problems with stress and i think people are right in saying that we do not get enough exercise but 

Recording: (2029/ 2140) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (2030/ 2140) 
i think one of the things that we when you are baptized is that you are really supposed to help other people to if somebody gives you a gift you want to give it to someone else but it is easy a lot of times just to fall into the you know like mold of not letting anyone know what you believe and just so that they think well what are those weirdos you know they do not wear makeup or whatever but we can wear makeup 

Recording: (2031/ 2140) 
no there is a lot of people that go to church that are not worth anything too you know so i do not really believe that going to church you know makes you a better human being than another human being i believe that most people is basic structure in life if it is based similar to the bible or you could say buddhism or whatever you know that you tend to have a better life than you will if you practice nonbuddhism 

Recording: (2032/ 2140) 
he works

and even if you had two full bloods from two different tribes and they had a child the federal government still considered some halfblood 

Recording: (2040/ 2140) 
objectives because when we went into the service and then went overseas our objective was do away with hitler and mussolini i am just thankful that he was not carrying a rifle in a rifle company or something

Recording: (2052/ 2140) 
yeah i did and then she was kind of a gossip she went around talking to everybody trying to get them all support nobody would support her 

Recording: (2053/ 2140) 
well you know because i have to think about how it went back into our income with everything else but i am sure that i did not pay more than $3000 on it cost me more than $3000 and so if i had $5000 or $6000 out of it i was happy 

Recording: (2054/ 2140) 
expanded bus service 

Recording: (2055/ 2140) 
it i had one of the lawyers that was being our judges at state came up afterwards and gave me his business card and said if and when you get through law school you may a call i was like kick man dude keep that card make a phone call maybe he will be like a fulltime partner when i get out mbc 뉴스 김재경입니다 

Recording: (2056/ 2140) 
and that kind of thing i think is pretty important just because of the simple fact of the statistics that they are doing it so at least at the very least they might have as well be safe about it 

Recording: (2057/ 2140) 
no not really i feel a huge difference for me personally just in the closeness and being able to pick up on his cues a lot better and just knowing his needs 

Recording: (2058/ 2140)

Recording: (2067/ 2140)

Recording: (2068/ 2140) 
i think if god meant me to i think it is wrong for them to be using that introvertal fertilization i think they call it introvertal to say the right thing what is it 

Recording: (2069/ 2140) 
yeah yeah it is been glamorized and they do not they do not value human life either i do not think because they are so so much violence you know you can not watch tv and not seeing somebody get shot or something and it is just like it is not really real because it is you know you turn the channel and then you see the same actor doing something else you are like see it was not real and i do not think they i think 

Recording: (2070/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (2071/ 2140)

Recording: (2074/ 2140) 
the three rs you know i think those are still very important 

Recording: (2075/ 2140) 
have nuns or anything there i mean you know i think they were sort of more concerned with you know actually it might have been later than the first sex education we had that young i mean it might have been more like a couple like eighth grade that they talked about condoms i doubt that they would have done that that early now that i think about it but i know that there was at one point you know some sort 

Recording: (2076/ 2140) 
right right 

Recording: (2077/ 2140) 
well i thought about that doing something in the animal area even as a vet assistant um 

Recording: (2078/ 2140)

everybody is living longer there is more medical things where people can be healed from things that they could not be healed from so everybody today is living longer living basically as today as their future were back 30 years ago i mean when i was a kid you know i mean i was not really thinking about today i mean i was thinking about tomorrow 

Recording: (2087/ 2140) 
that is a thing but the thing is some people say well why did you do this the thing is why do not you talk to those people and say hey why not do this what i am doing best now we complement the team 

Recording: (2088/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (2089/ 2140) 
of different views on how things work but i mean for the most part i can not see that as being too big of a problem obviously there are more like violent guys out there and things like that than there are women but at the same time i would not say there is anything to overprotect 

Recording: (2090/ 2140) 
i never looked into that but that is a good suggestion yeah like being they are going to be like you know like spanish instructors no i never thought about that not until you just said it so yeah or like teaching english as a second language i know they teach those classes classes here so i was thinking well you know maybe i should start looking into like teaching classes but i was like well i did not know if that was like true or not that you can actually teach around

my kids went to a school where my son had already left it but in the fourth grade they announced took all the kids in the auditorium and said we are closing next year and it was hard but once it is reached the point that decision is made and announced then there were good reasons for it and they explain the reasons and at some point you have to figure out how much do you want to fight something 

Recording: (2093/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (2094/ 2140) 
right
