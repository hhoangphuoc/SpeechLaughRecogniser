 almost the minority. It was a pretty even, it was a low income neighborhood. And when I was in seventh grade I remember going home and saying was everybody the same and being told well of course they are.  So I went to school and told everybody I was in love with Danny Flowers, who happened to be black. And I got called into the office, and they called the social worker, and I was punished. I wasn't allowed to ask.  I was grounded for the year and they never called this kid in. Then I thought this whole thing is so screwed up. What's wrong with these people? They kept saying 

Recording: (5/ 2140) 
 Yeah, well actually I do silk screening for t-shirts for my like for like on the side for myself like to generate income and then also as of  Monday, I'm working at Ohio. It's an environmental group. I'll be doing canvassing type stuff, just basically going door to door, sign this petition. 

Recording: (6/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7/ 2140) 
 I mean, we went in there one day and I explained the whole thing to her. And then she puts off some kind of excuse to the administrator. She says, well,  We don't need problem students like yourself, blah, blah, blah. I said, what problem? 

Recording: (8/ 2140) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (9/ 2140) 
 until I threatened to sue them. 

Recording: (10/ 2140) 
 went on a mission and came back and so I just got accepted into that college. But yeah. 

Recording: (11/ 2140) 
 Yeah! 

Recording: (12/ 2140) 
 Yeah.

 That's ridiculous. That's amazing to me. 

Recording: (14/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (15/ 2140) 
 kept promoting. And then all of a sudden, about the 90s, they came around and said, hey, you know what? Our deficit's going the other way. We're going way out of whack on this thing. That's because we've been spending more.  Consumers are doing the same thing. They haven't learned that mom and dad remember mom went out and got little pieces of time as they needed things. No, I'm with the whole house completely  for

 EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE 

Recording: (17/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (18/ 2140) 
 You know, I mean, so it is true with different pets. 

Recording: (19/ 2140) 
 But I want them to do that to me. And I think if you could teach your kids that and get back to teaching them the same thing on those radio programs and TV programs instead of what they're showing right now.  I think the world would be a lot of place a lot better place and long to the politicians that they stopped saying now What's really best for the general public? Instead of what we think to make our  ourselves look great. 

Recording: (20/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (21/ 2140) 
 to move forward in my life. Now what happened with the chill was, you know, there was, I had a friend that  work for them so they didn't know that and he told me that there was glass in the back room that they were supposed to  installed, supposed to have installed that was five feet higher, three to five feet higher. And shoulda, woulda, coulda, you know, if it

 and have the two daughters. 

Recording: (24/ 2140) 
 which I think George W. is trying to do. Whenever anybody tells me that I go tell them yes and I'm an individual.  liberal. 

Recording: (25/ 2140) 
 I have just the same opinion I think most people have as a TV. 

Recording: (26/ 2140) 
 I'm an independent. 

Recording: (27/ 2140) 
 You should be real attentive to what's happening in his school situation his or her. 

Recording: (28/ 2140) 
 you 

Recording: (29/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (30/ 2140) 
 What'd you do? 

Recording: (31/ 2140) 
 Well, that guy who could change form. And in the movie they're about to kiss. I don't like it when they get that close. I like the...  their relationship is still professional and they interact with each other on that level first and they're very good friends and they have that tension but they don't  come to it and I really like it, I just dislike it a little less. 

Recording: (32/ 2140) 
 and decisions are happening to her without her making them. And I think she needs to have as many facts as she can get herself.  hands on. 

Recording: (33/ 2140) 
 I'd like to be, you know, but she lives, I keep telling her, I wish you'd move down here, but I'm not moving to Toledo. I don't like Toledo.  you 

Recording: (34/ 2140) 
 uh... i don't i mean they're definitely is that image of you know dallas and i see i think it's it's worse i think  the image of the tourists. Basically they think anyone who can afford to be over there must be absolutely loaded. That was sort of another thing when  you know, I went to school there is, you know, I had a scholarship. That's how I went there, you know, and I worked the 

Recording: (35/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (36/ 2140) 
 Right. 

Recording: (37/ 2140) 
 Really? 

Recording: (38/ 2140) 
 I said that and he's like. 

Recording: (39/ 2140) 
 I think the teachers are every bit as good as the students.  but I think there seems to be the whole administration up through the board and just it's not as  I don't know how to describe it. It's like the teachers are sort of, it seems like they almost have the feeling they're on their own.  Well, I'm going to go ahead and get started. 

Recording: (40/ 2140) 
 It was neat because my mom was 29 and Pete was 18. Pete was just like some kid who liked to play. We would go and fly kites and do all  all this fun stuff and 

Recording: (41/ 2140) 
 So 

Recording: (42/ 2140) 
 Yeah, I don't understand it. I really have a hard time understanding, you know, they're not after you. They just want to live a life. 

Recording: (43/ 2140) 
 You know? Yeah. 

Recording: (44/ 2140) 
 Mmm, I wasn't there that long. 

Recording: (45/ 2140) 
 See, he's just in his twos and I like, he's gotta be in a cart or something. Well, cuz when I'm holding his hand and taking him.  He just tends to want to, he's not calm and collective. He's a little, you know.  So that's why we don't do nothing, because when I take them to people's houses, I can't do that, because they'll get into everything. I get real stressed out about that. 

Recording: (46/ 2140) 
 Right. 

Recording: (47/ 2140) 
 I mean, I had parents that everything I did was negative. I mean, they just told me I couldn't do this, couldn't do that. And so what I try to do is when anything comes up, I always think of how my parents would handle it.  and I do 180 degrees. I sort of feel I'm mentally okay now, but I don't know how I got here because I've been there.  way, you know, and it's, you know. 

Recording: (48/ 2140) 
 Right. 

Recording: (49/ 2140) 
 It was part of the time. 

Recording: (50/ 2140) 
 But people coming from other cities, like Chicago, New York, and places like that, where they were treated poorly by whites.  They tended to act differently towards you and everything until they realized that you weren't like that, you know. We only had one racial incident when I was in the service.  where it was, we were predominantly white platoon and because we worked in missiles and stuff, you know, so. 

Recording: (51/ 2140) 
 You know, my daughter, you know, there's just a lot of stuff when she was in high school and I'd call up to the school and, you know, the principal like, he'd say, Miss, you know, I'm.  I am her last chance. You know, my daughter was going to summer school every summer.  And he's like Mrs. You know she's like you know the average student.  you 

Recording: (52/ 2140) 
 I wonder if that's also a socialized medicine there. It is socialized, isn't it? 

Recording: (53/ 2140) 
 Okay, so people can like fly in, do their little wedding thing, fly out. 

Recording: (54/ 2140) 
 Do this. 

Recording: (55/ 2140) 
 If they're having something for supper you don't like, you pass it on and you go, I don't care for any thank you. You know, make a big scene like so-and-so did the other night at my house that, you know, made me feel  like this big when I'm the cook. 

Recording: (56/ 2140) 
 people that were pushing the free speech gets mugged or anything else happens to them. 

Recording: (57/ 2140) 
 Yeah. OK. 

Recording: (58/ 2140) 
 Well, it's good now. Well, the web again has changed that. Computers have made a big difference. It's more exciting now for people who are in that.  that area who are interested in. It's more emphasis on information and not books and things. Going to the library is getting the information. 

Recording: (59/ 2140) 
 And so, you know, even though it turns out to be the real traditional breakdown, it's not it's not because I have to. It's not because he you know, he wouldn't do something that.  that something else, this suits me fine. 

Recording: (60/ 2140) 
 My one granddaughter, they live in Springfield. They just moved to Springfield and she goes to kindergarten.  a half day and this child is only five years old he has them reading the newspaper  over, watching the news. She told me a story about Christopher Columbus discovering 

Recording: (61/ 2140) 
 Yeah, and then I went to work before that. I had to walk from Hilliard one day through, matter of fact, through this 12th Avenue.  Stretch right there 

Recording: (62/ 2140) 
 tanks they claimed that we hit but 

Recording: (63/ 2140) 
 Yeah, because I don't like vegetables. My hands are going to sleep. I don't like vegetables is what it is. So it's real hard for me. 

Recording: (64/ 2140) 
 You're right. I never went back home. 

Recording: (65/ 2140) 
 they don't have auditions, they just take anybody that wants to play. And if you take a string player that can't play in tune, it can really wreck everything.  Yeah, but I think we've improved a lot. We gave a concert a couple weeks ago at a church in Upper Arlington.  And I thought it went pretty well. A wind piece, a little bit of Mozart, some concertos.

 NCR paper.  He didn't have to write, you know, if he wasn't getting the notes. 

Recording: (67/ 2140) 
 Answered an ad in the paper, but I've sung in, well, Sean sings in the symphony chorus too. I've sung in it for 16 years. 

Recording: (68/ 2140) 
 She wants to go to Columbus State. Wants to get into one of their engineering tech programs.  And I hope she does. She never failed.  She's mature in many ways, but she's had to be responsible for herself her whole life. 

Recording: (69/ 2140) 
 She's so bright. I mean, she really is. I think it's one of those things where she just doesn't turn in her stuff, you know? And she's 12. 

Recording: (70/ 2140) 
 Yeah, the Brady Bill didn't really do it for America like they thought. I mean, yeah, you wait five days, big deal. Go out on 20th Avenue and  pick one up in five minutes. You know, I've seen all kinds of people carry guns that shouldn't.

Recording: (73/ 2140) 
 30 on it and his report card he's got like a 1.25 average. So they take Jelena who has an A, him who has a D and they go well gee the average kid in this school is like  C plus and they're stupid at this school. Columbus like schools don't do any good. Then you go to Dublin, Worthington, Westerville. In order to get there, you're not going to be in his condition.  and you're not gonna be stupid because you're trying to, you know, probably both husband and wife work, so the intelligence is there, and you're not gonna have dumb people. 

Recording: (74/ 2140) 
 personally. 

Recording: (75/ 2140) 
 No. 

Recording: (76/ 2140) 
 Um... 

Recording: (77/ 2140) 
 Yeah, so, mm-hmm, right. 

Recording: (78/ 2140) 
 The parenting stuff they gave us a video to watch at home which was things like how to diaper your baby, whether you should leave them crying  dying in their bassinet or crib, which of course I think is horrible. I think it's good that they've come out with all these new studies that tell people don't do that. Let's see what  else was there feeding your baby. 

Recording: (79/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (80/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (81/ 2140) 
 Because they got beaches and yeah. I don't think Lake Erie can compare. That would hurt. 

Recording: (82/ 2140)

Recording: (83/ 2140) 
 come to offer me that. I mean she's the first, I never even heard of it. And there's all kinds of programs that you know.  Like, there's this one that, where, like, say, I live with my mom. My mom can be getting paid from the government for me to be  living there, you know, because she kind of helps me out, you know. And I don't know what that was called. I mean, I'm just now finding this stuff out, you know. 

Recording: (84/ 2140) 
 And not that that changed my opinion of her, but back then, and nobody would talk about it. And I just think in today's world.  we need to bring subjects like that out. Because there are so many people who are ashamed about things and they shouldn't be ashamed because it's a lifestyle anymore.  It needs to be brought up more. 

Recording: (85/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (86/ 2140) 
 mother used to be a principal of mine in elementary school so he's like I think we should talk I was like okay great because I was like yeah boy you're way too serious for  this particular affair. Okay, that's fine. We knew ahead of time that this was all coming to an end. Don't worry about it. So I, at this point in the story, I should point out that the paper that I went downstairs for,  I don't know where that is. I never found it. Never saw it. Never. It's anyway not relevant in all the story, but it bugs me every time I tell the story because doesn't exist anyway 

Recording: (87/ 2140) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (88/ 2140) 
 So what was different about it?  the things that I really enjoyed that was different was the traffic. That really became interesting and different for me when I started working for a courier  service winter quarter. I took all classes off winter quarter and worked for a courier service because I needed some money and I love driving. And let me tell you, it's really, really different 

Recording: (89/ 2140) 
 And there are some people that deserve to be fired. And there's no way that you can really differentiate just because they're in a union. 

Recording: (90/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (91/ 2140) 
 There was nothing there that really I can remember that did anything good for me. I mean I think middle school taught me a lot more  High School. 

Recording: (92/ 2140) 
 for the slick image, it bothers me. He has a potential of trampling Gore. I think that Gore will be the nominee, no matter what Bradley does.  Gore has it sewn up because he's the insider. 

Recording: (93/ 2140) 
 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다. 

Recording: (94/ 2140) 
 right. 

Recording: (95/ 2140) 
 Right. Right. That's right. Yeah. So that was an interesting and when we went to church up Hamilton and over to  and  out by Carl there's shopping center after shopping center after shopping center after housing development after but when we did that 

Recording: (96/ 2140) 
 to the other side. 

Recording: (97/ 2140) 
 terrible murderers get away with murder now by that plea bargain that plea bargain I think is a most thing that ever was passed I don't think  should be any plea bargains. And then there are people who get murdered and sent to the electric chair. Electric chair? I still believe in it. Because if someone is  And I don't believe that they should have 10 years of what do they call that legal process where they can bring appeals. Thank you. That's it. 

Recording: (98/ 2140) 
 Yeah, because I mean five years went by like... 

Recording: (99/ 2140) 
 So. 

Recording: (100/ 2140) 
 Oh, that was the Monica Lewinsky. 

Recording: (101/ 2140) 
 I was raised. 

Recording: (102/ 2140) 
 My honors class is challenging and organic chemistry is very challenging, but 

Recording: (103/ 2140) 
 She has trouble driving even at night and stuff like that. 

Recording: (104/ 2140) 
 before I found out actually. So we can stop the story here. It's a fun story. 

Recording: (105/ 2140) 
 And I did a lot of music interviewing and writing there. And then I moved up to editor. And it was sort of through that job that I got my first job with Sony while I was  as a sort of Ohio representative. So I was concentrated in Ohio State. And then, you know, basically, it's just something I'm not doing this as a career.  It's just sort of something I'm doing in the meantime until I decide whether I'm going back to school or not. 

Recording: (106/ 2140) 
 She's grown, she's expanded her horizons, if you will. 

Recording: (107/ 2140) 
 I don't have any evidence to support it. I just know that I feel that I have a distinct, a very clear distinction between what is fact  and what is fiction, what is true and what is imaginary. And so for me, I don't think that television has affected me in that way.  I mean, one way that television has affected me is I am full of media references. 

Recording: (108/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (109/ 2140) 
 right? 

Recording: (110/ 2140) 
 Green Bay Packers. 

Recording: (111/ 2140) 
 See, that's how my husband was. He didn't have a pet growing up. 

Recording: (112/ 2140) 
 Yeah, I got more people to buy presents for though. 

Recording: (113/ 2140) 
 That's still enough for me. 

Recording: (114/ 2140) 
 Wow, yeah 

Recording: (115/ 2140) 
 I mean, I don't know enough about it to really say, but I can't. I mean, I don't know where they got that. 

Recording: (116/ 2140) 
 Yeah, I can't wait. 

Recording: (117/ 2140) 
 I mean, I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do that.  Not nice. No. 

Recording: (118/ 2140) 
 You know. 

Recording: (119/ 2140) 
 And then when it became cold enough in September, October, maybe even as far as November, this year would have been November, we would take those shoes out. And depending upon  And whose foot fit those shoes, those would be the person who wore them. It wouldn't be the one who had worn them in the spring, because he's growing in the meantime.  And it may go to another another and I can remember we passed shoes down as many as four wee children now my dad also repaired shoes

 you 

Recording: (122/ 2140) 
 Well, you have to try some different things, like put on headphones with music that doesn't have any words and try to read somewhere. 

Recording: (123/ 2140) 
 Yeah, that's what they suggest doing is two years of med school, get your PhD, and then do your last two years of med school. 

Recording: (124/ 2140) 
 Oh, there always has been. There always has been. I think a lot of people feel that kids, a lot of kids are on medication today that shouldn't be.  But I think that's the fault of the school or the parents or some doctor that, like for example, when we refer kids in  Worthington to a doctor, we have a list of three doctors that we work with. And we know that they won't just give this kid a pill if he doesn't have eight out of the 12 symptoms or

 Yeah, I'm a Democrat. I've never voted for a Republican in my life, even when I lived in Oregon and I always adored Mark Hatfield. I didn't vote for him.  I was out there with him, we're insane, because I thought he was a great Republican.  But I think personally Mike Coleman was good. I've met well

 needs for that budget. They bought things on a cash basis as they needed it. They did not go out and spend on credit.  Business said, hey, let's produce these lines. Little lady, you want a refrigerator? We can make it for you. And we can make it cheap for you because we can mass produce it. 

Recording: (132/ 2140) 
 I'm sorry. 

Recording: (133/ 2140) 
 I mean I didn't have the greatest childhood, I don't think any of us ever really had the best, you know, but I don't like to talk to my kids the way some of these people talk.  Well, one today, you know, she got on the bus and a little girl went and sat over here. She's probably about...  8 maybe 6 or something like that and she wanted to sit here with mommy so she made her sit with her which is cool and mommy just goes to sleep and the little kids trying to study her homework you know

 His mother died the week after he got married. She had diabetes, juvenile diabetes, diagnosed at age 11 and just over the years.  I ended up having open heart surgery and didn't make it through the surgery. My grandmother also died during open heart surgery, so my perception of open heart surgery, even though I'm a nurse,  It's not very good just because of the two.

 My son, now I saw him when, let's see, he was 15 maybe, he'd run across the street when Martha, the 86-year-old lady across the street, was trying  bring her garbage down. He'd seen me do that. He'd go, oh, let me get that for you, Martha. She's got arthritis. She looks like she's going to fall. She takes steps about this big.  And I've seen him do that.

 Yeah, but I've got more influence, I think. Maybe, I'm not sure. I'm hoping I've got more influence over him than his father does. 

Recording: (152/ 2140) 
 Yeah, I mean, I want to see how the season ends out. It's just a lot of the ones this season to me have just been disappointing.  I mean I think every show sort of has a peak. Some shows peak towards the end, some at the beginning and sort of level off. The Simpsons had a stretch from like  their third year through like their seventh where things were just like unbelievably funny and then they had some writing changes I think and this this season it's just

I think that if you're married and you realize  that you get to a point where you and this other person are not in a positive relationship for each other or for anybody else in your family, that it's better to just say,  This is not working. We both deserve to be happy and go your own separate ways.

 But then that hurts the administrators in the sense that they're there to provide an education. So it'd be rough.  and like my high school they put up cameras and they locked bathrooms like at certain times you couldn't go in them.

You never  had any traffic, you don't sit on the freeway like you do now, now it's like you don't want to go out at 4 o'clock, you just don't want to get involved in it.  I don't know, growth is good, but I guess I'm not into it as much as a lot of other people. It's good for the economy, but it's just amazing all the

 My opinion changes from day to day on who's fault it is.  Actually, at this point in time, I don't know whose fault it is. I think it's the fault of evolution.  Well, it could have been prevented, but we didn't know it was going to happen, that our society was going to change so intensely.

 I, you know, from my perspective, which is skewed, of course, to me, I think it just seems that way. I mean, it was, we're only talking about ten cases, that's not very many, you know, I mean.  You could, by coincidence, have them all be African American. If I were African American, I think I would have a different perspective.  And I don't live in a neighborhood where we see a lot of police, so I'm not in touch with it.

 I think that's a good sign, but I think there's a huge, there's millions of children that don't have any health care and that's not right.  lot of like between the lower and the upper there's a huge disparity but at least it's a step in the right direction we have a nice solid middle income middle income middle income base  I think because a lot of countries only have that like I visited Mexico and it seems like they only had the distinction between the upper and lower I mean their middle class is very small and that I'm

 were like, oh, English people, your accent is so neat, and all that kind of thing. And then when I went there, and this was actually one of my friends, but I remember,  She was German and she was sort of asking me how you say different words and things. And then she sort of looked at me and she said, like, oh, actually, I shouldn't be asking you. I don't want to learn the American way to say those. Like, I want to learn the  British way. People would say things all the time and they'd ask you what your background was and if you'd say, well, I'm American, they'd say, well, where you're

Recording: (252/ 2140) 
 Because then, you know, what if something major happens that fourth time, then what? But I think, at least for children especially, because they have no means to help themselves.  And like the parents obviously even if they're working a lot of times can't get health care for their children so I think at least for children how many accidents happen to children like  People are always breaking arms and stuff.

 But when you look at Coleman, there was a point where they asked a yes or no question.

 I think they're doing different things, like different people in the program. But I kind of decided to take the easy route. 

Recording: (310/ 2140) 
 three weeks and they go that's right. So they take there's no excuses you know and it's it is very hard I know my youngest daughter who is just as smart as my oldest  would do horrible there because, you know, basically they say, we're talking about China this week, and on December the 15th, we want to report on  why Chinese people do what they do. And every week they don't come by and go, have you started? Have you started? Have you started? Do you have the outline?

Recording: (312/ 2140) 
 Go out and have fun, person. 

Recording: (313/ 2140) 
 I'm concerned that we are getting away from penalties completely. I feel it's absolutely essential that we have penalties.  we have for everyone, for everyone, really across the board. We are getting away from penalty, we're getting away from penalty.  But so many people, just to give an example, talking about adults, I just read a statistic 

Recording: (314/ 2140) 
 Well if it doesn't work then I can, well that's what my best friend Amy said, I'll get married and hell if it doesn't work I'll just get a divorce. That's a great attitude to have Amy.  But I mean... 

Recording: (315/ 2140) 
 Anyway. 

Recording: (316/ 2140) 
 Yeah, I usually am. Not quite there yet. Not really.

 I think it was the east side, I think. It was a while ago. He hasn't been there for a while.  Uh-huh. 

Recording: (318/ 2140) 
 Yeah, that's right. Frank Sinatra is the one I was thinking, I'll do it. I did it my way. And that's really, I think, the biggest problem in the world today. I want to do it my way.  My way and you can't or you got to cooperate with the other person. 

Recording: (319/ 2140) 
 And it's kind of weird because when I went from middle school to high school, it was like a big growing up period. And I see them like, what are you doing that for? 

Recording: (320/ 2140) 
 Sounds a lot like our dog. 

Recording: (321/ 2140) 
 And that was part of the process there, how to work work and work up there too with people. But if we could just share.  more.

 They're normal people just outside of their sexual, well, majority of the people prefer heterosexual.

 Well, this is about giving opinions and my opinion about the Columbus Public School System really isn't good. 

Recording: (326/ 2140) 
 But they always say don't let the animals sleep with you and all that. And with the cat, they curl up with you. It's hard to say. No, but you know what, honestly, eventually,  It took probably a year. 

Recording: (327/ 2140) 
 네. 

Recording: (328/ 2140) 
 Really, and it's a fun job, it really is. I've only ever known one male that taught first grade. And I knew one guy that taught third.  Most of the time if they go into elementary ed they go for the upper grades like 4, 5, or 6. But I really think that if we let the boys  always be more exposed to men earlier, then they would be more motivated to learn because they would see that it's not just a girly thing.

 If it were possible, I think that a lot of parents are trying to raise them what they think is the best right now, and that's another problem. It seems like the way the finance  World has come up and everything else the way the cost of living has increased it almost takes two parents in that home if you want to Really live a halfway decent life and be able to do some of the extra things  things. No one wants to live and only have to be able to disuse, like you said, the necessities. 

Recording: (333/ 2140) 
 Yeah, where are they needed? Right.

 No. 

Recording: (335/ 2140) 
 You know, he says that E equals MC squared, I say it's E equals MC cubed because the world is three dimensional. It's not two dimensional.  dimensional limits and everything but you look at history relativity all of our mathematical theorems physical theorems on physics and things of that nature  have been based off that. 

Recording: (336/ 2140) 
 Now is when I need to be off with them, where we can take them out and run. 

Recording: (337/ 2140) 
 for parties so because it's actually a market it's all done outside like tonight we're going to the uh gobleth pavilion which is um it next to the  It's really beautiful and people do a lot of parties there. 

Recording: (338/ 2140) 
 And he did that too. 

Recording: (339/ 2140) 
 It's like with this adoption of the baby, we know that that's best, but dealing with the emotions of it, we're very family oriented. And this is a grandchild we'll never see. 

Recording: (340/ 2140) 
 and just totally bombarded. And I mean here it's so force-fed as well. I mean I came home just before Halloween and you know I walked into the grocery store.  I mean, just like right there were just like cakes, cupcakes, cookies, like everything just right in front of you with like all this Halloween stuff on.  All the holidays in here are so pushed at you and it's such a money making, you know, and it's so over the top. Where there, it's sort of like there's a little bit of that and there are decorations and stuff. 

Recording: (341/ 2140) 
 If you just look at the nature of what they're doing, it's just... 

Recording: (342/ 2140) 
 Yeah, well it was like I kind of just like stopped going to class and and like I just like ended up withdrawing  because I would have like failed everything anyways but yeah then I was living with my friend for a while but and then like now I  Now me and her and my other friend live in Down Under, Maynard. 

Recording: (343/ 2140) 
 And then they're going to say they want to nail their parents. Their parents are sitting at home. They have no idea what that kid's doing. 

Recording: (344/ 2140) 
 rate well kind of like just because everybody else is doing it this way it doesn't mean it's the right way and yeah I you know I really  really struggle with that because I come more from I think the family should teach it but let's be realistic how many families are going to do that or how  the mentality to do that. It seems like, so like my dad, it seems like these days most of the people, a lot of people that are having kids  you 

Recording: (345/ 2140) 
 which was, see with those guns of ours, we figured within 10 yards was a hit.  If you had one of those things, 37 pounds of TNT would go off within 10 yards of it. 

Recording: (346/ 2140) 
 I just renewed my certificate last year, so I may get back into it. Part of the reason I renewed my certificate was I did some home instruction with the Columbus  public schools last year and that's kind of like a tutoring job where you can go, you can arrange hours with a student that is at home for some reason.  I had one that just had a baby. And they, it's an interesting job because they look for somebody that can cover 

Recording: (347/ 2140) 
 run quick, put plastic on.  Oh, I don't know. It seemed like it's a tough call because it's a very unusual situation here at Ohio State where they have a union and they have so many different  skills in a union. You think of unions, you think of auto workers, you think of pipe fitters, you don't think of such a wide variety of 

Recording: (348/ 2140) 
 the one that's 18 now, I thought he was going to be left handed up until he was like four. Because his dad's left handed, my sister's left handed, I have one left handed parent. Well, all of a sudden  in one day picked up a thing with the right hand and he's been with his right hand ever since. So you really can't tell because they're pretty much either or.  until they were about five. 

Recording: (349/ 2140) 
 I mean Columbus Public, they got some work to do too. Like the other night I was watching TV and an  elementary school overdosed a kid on like some I think it was a drug to calm him down so he's not so hyper and they like overdosed  him like twice in a day and then when he goes home his mom's even overdosing him because they're overdosing him. 

Recording: (350/ 2140) 
 I don't know. I would like to say no sitting here, but you never know because I guess that's what happens to a lot of them. They come out of school all ID-free.  idealistic and then they go into industry and then they're molded and assuming they make upper management There's you want the tax breaks you want thing, you know, I mean and then the other  Like I have an uncle, he's a vice president on Wall Street for Merrill Lynch and he said, you know, he got out of school and he was very idealistic, but now he... 

Recording: (351/ 2140) 
 sure you do something with them. But this group, the middle 30s I called them, you had to misogyism. And that's what Clinton did so well. And that's what Dole could have done. I'm not sure if  George W. is going to be able to because to get the nomination eventually he's going to come out and have to make his hard statements to those people which is I'm anti-abortion,  pro-gun, he's already said the pro-gun, and that's going against what most Americans are saying. Dole, I think, represented where most Americans

 Oh yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (353/ 2140) 
 quarter. 

Recording: (354/ 2140) 
 And I think some of my feelings about that sort of thing is colored by the fact that I collected data for 20 years from employers.  I'm a lot more sympathetic to that sort of thing. Yeah, I'm just a lot more sympathetic to people  collecting data. 

Recording: (355/ 2140)

Recording: (359/ 2140) 
 So she so I probably did learn a little bit because I she's still that she's lives with a man now and he does all the cooking still so I've  I learned everything on my own upon cooking and stuff like that, which I did love to cook. 

Recording: (360/ 2140) 
 I know people that sleep outside, and not all of them are veterans and everything, but there again, they don't want to be a part of the quote-unquote sheltered.  system, you know, staying in an open shelter VOA or something like that.

 I was 48 when I retired. It's great. It's terrific.

 And they'll ignore them, won't they? Because they're in their good Sunday clothes. 

Recording: (363/ 2140) 
 Oh yeah, it's so much better than having an alley or sitting there on your deck and looking at your house, the neighbors right behind you, you're staring at them sitting on their deck. We got all woods and a creek and then  the golf course. So that's hard to find in the city limits because we're inside 270 still.

 Well, the charge was cutting class. Yeah, and what it was, I was supposed to meet my mom outside. I told my teacher, I brought a note.  Got to excuse slip and all that. I went down to my locker before and the teacher, we called her the general because she would always be out there watching you.  not a teacher but an administrator excuse me and she was out there and she saw me in my locker and what are you doing down here in the whole 30 minute 

Recording: (369/ 2140) 
 Yeah, I would be at least 30 maybe, like getting up towards 40 before I have the experience really necessary to get in a good job. I don't want to be, I mean like...  My, uh, Venturing Crew Advisor is 38 and retired. I mean, I'm going more for there.

 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (371/ 2140) 
 a couple movies here and there, but we see what they rent or take out compared to the cartoon network and all these crazy…  just seem so worthless nowadays. But actually you watch some of the older cartoons that we watched and they seem more violent than some of the new ones. You know, Daffy Duck and the Road Runner and these types  of things, all it was was kill the fox. So we were like, wow, I don't know if we want to let them watch that either. Yeah, they were

 Well, I don't know if it's Monroe County or... 

Recording: (377/ 2140) 
 I think that's really a major problem, and I think there's a lot of problem with young kids today. Do it my way, or they all hit them, or... 

Recording: (378/ 2140) 
 Yeah, as I was teasing. 

Recording: (379/ 2140) 
 I know. 

Recording: (380/ 2140)

 because the priest they had there wouldn't let him take communion and all the other kids were taking communion. And that's pretty much the priest decides that. And he felt singled out.  And he was, he was the only one, and he was uncomfortable with it. But it hasn't been a problem.  person myself, but I'm not against it. And maybe I've justified it to myself by saying, well, they're teaching values.

 It's a clinical study where we're seeing how treadmill training affects ambulation in people with spinal cord injury.

Recording: (385/ 2140) 
 Yeah.

 It's just like the people you see go to church. I walk out of church and see somebody sitting there that's homeless.

 Oh yeah, almost always. It doesn't matter what the disability is. I don't know why this is, but they used to say 8 to 1. Now they're saying more like  five to one. It doesn't matter if it's a speech impediment, blindness, retardation, cerebral palsy, deafness, learning disability, you name it, there's five  to one more boys than there are girls. And we don't know why.

 in the tin. 

Recording: (393/ 2140) 
 I think it has changed drastically and I think it is changing and I think it will also be changing in the future. Going all the way back  finances were not a consideration in the, oh I'd say probably my first 30, maybe 40 years, there was some.  influence, but I think the influence was not financial. It was influence from the person who could get up here and talk with a group of people and sway them with 

Recording: (394/ 2140) 
 Is that right? 

Recording: (395/ 2140) 
 Sure! 

Recording: (396/ 2140) 
 Exactly. 

Recording: (397/ 2140) 
 Yeah, it got into a situation where you really weren't, there was a no-win situation from the get-go. And I think that had we been able to do what we were able to do,  went over there to do initially, it would have worked out okay, but we weren't, so it became a political war, as everybody knows. 

Recording: (398/ 2140) 
 Got a ways to go. It's getting bitter.

 There's a lot. We need to do a lot of evolving. We definitely do. 

Recording: (408/ 2140) 
 I think it was a nice thing about what we had. We had grandparents that were not necessarily, they were out of state in some cases.  We didn't see them that much. We made it a part that we communicated with the grandparents regularly. And when we did, it was a special time.  Emphasize the fact that kids want to do certain things. They saw their mother go out and maybe do some additional things to 

Recording: (409/ 2140) 
 Hmm 

Recording: (410/ 2140) 
 forced to take this class. I think that if I, I mean it's good to being forced to take a liberal arts thing because you don't know what you want to do. So it's like if you hate math and you don't take it at  But then you decide you want to do something in math and you're like screwed like can't go back

 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (415/ 2140) 
 But it's parents that fight for the society and what's in your community. You know the parents for each individual child, they have to all form together.  as a group and almost be a parent to all these kids as a group. You can be the best parent in the world at home and then your kid goes to school  school and it accesses the computer or they get in a group of kids where their parents don't even know where they are. It's the kids' responsibility to get and go to school. Maybe the mom and 

Recording: (416/ 2140) 
 home. We interact. The school is great. You have people that are on the clock. Whoop, time to quit. They're gone.  Those people don't know the meaning of life. They will never know the meaning of life. But if they stay around, try to extend themselves a little more with somebody that's  problems at work and are willing to work with that person. I say willing to work, not knowing they're going to be compensated because they'll be compensated 

Recording: (417/ 2140) 
 Right! 

Recording: (418/ 2140) 
 You know, like there are two fishermen that found him at sea. You never hear about the other one because this was on one, just briefly I heard on the news, because he thinks he should go back to his father. But you don't hear about him.  There's three cousins. Two of them think he should stay in Miami. The other one thinks he should go back with his father. You don't hear about him. He's reading about him in Newsweek or someplace.  So I think the news media has not been totally objective about this. 

Recording: (419/ 2140) 
 Yeah! 

Recording: (420/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (421/ 2140) 
 They're covered, but it was real tricky because she was a US citizen. She fell in love through email over the internet back in the early, like 1990, it was real early.  and went over there and married the guy. And so she had some of the medical problems and she emigrated. It took years to get that straightened out.  But she's covered now. 

Recording: (422/ 2140) 
 How many times have you been in Ireland? 

Recording: (423/ 2140) 
 If they had a way to cure it, then fine, but leave that up to the people. 

Recording: (424/ 2140) 
 That's how I feel. That's what I believe. I choose to believe that. 

Recording: (425/ 2140) 
 Well, it's like the... 

Recording: (426/ 2140) 
 this just can't go on. Not that they're going to stop it totally. 

Recording: (427/ 2140) 
 going to be a really busy day. And the same thing at Port Columbus. I'd see all these cars but it would be just about the same traffic. And I mentioned to somebody, I go, where are the extra  planes and they go, they can't add extra airplanes. They have certain routes they can do, they just have to put bigger airplanes on. So they said, you know, you'll see larger airplanes when it's hollow  time so they can put more people on. 

Recording: (428/ 2140) 
 right 

Recording: (429/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (430/ 2140) 
 Yeah, we need to pay the rent and that's, yeah. 

Recording: (431/ 2140) 
 There was snow or something. 

Recording: (432/ 2140) 
 Yeah, so she said she's going to be catching the disability bus out here, you know, after a certain amount of time, she's going to ride that bus. 

Recording: (433/ 2140) 
 or more accurately, I think she took it, but it's a fine line. And so she wears that around and I replaced it. So I have my own again. I wear this one around. So we have  competition to see who can get the most well-traveled ring. You get two points for every country and you get one point for every state or province within that country. 

Recording: (434/ 2140) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (435/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (436/ 2140) 
 I like to talk about Columbus. 

Recording: (437/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (438/ 2140) 
 Okay, let's go. 

Recording: (439/ 2140) 
 What we should buy. Yeah, the retail. What we should buy. And that's the problem. We listen to business too much. If business  reemphasized their goals to help society out and not themselves. 

Recording: (440/ 2140) 
 And I think, of course, we would all hope that abortion wouldn't be, that nobody would have an abortion. That would be the perfect world.  nobody would ever be in a situation where they would need one. But I also think, you know, I mean, yeah, there shouldn't be, there shouldn't  shouldn't spend six weeks on abortion or six weeks on what to do if you're pregnant. But I think the subject has to be mentioned just in passing. 

Recording: (441/ 2140) 
 I think for the most part people can handle it. Obviously I think probably more the older generations would be the ones that would  have the bigger problem with it. The ones that grew up during the whole black rights movements and things like that. I could see them having a problem with it but I mean more like  like 

Recording: (442/ 2140) 
 I mean, I liked Earl Bruce and I waited on him a couple times at a restaurant I worked at. He was the nicest man and when they did that, I don't know if you know about that, when they fired him the day before.  for the Michigan game for having a 9-3 season three years in a row. They fired him the day before that game. 

Recording: (443/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (444/ 2140) 
 I don't know. Trial stuff, I also wouldn't mind doing, since I'll have a business degree, I wouldn't mind doing some sort of financial laws stuff.  I don't want to be an ambulation.  I don't want to be an ambulance chaser, I just want to be somebody who helps screw all the big giants. 

Recording: (445/ 2140) 
 break. 

Recording: (446/ 2140) 
 we do have a mutual thing and young people there you know there's so many different infatuations to start with that they get blinded and they get you know  off course and everything else and then it doesn't stay the same. I mean it's all exciting and all that and then I think it's kind of... 

Recording: (447/ 2140) 
 Yeah. Yeah. 

Recording: (448/ 2140) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (449/ 2140) 
 We dated in high school, but he ended up going to prom with somebody else. We went to kindergarten  all the way through and my sister and his sister were the same age and my mom and his mom were campfire leaders together in the whole bit and then we didn't really date in college  kind of really didn't get together at all freshman year. He did go to school here and then as I said I swam for Ohio State and then I went into Agler Davidson, a sporting goods 

Recording: (450/ 2140) 
 I've been here all my life. Right now I don't do anything.  I had a head injury in 93 where I got hit with a hockey puck in the head.  chill hockey game. 

Recording: (451/ 2140) 
 Well, I have different options. I'm thinking I could either be an art teacher or have some kind of  freelance type thing for my home. And I really want to just hurry up and get done with it.  school as fast as I can. My husband and I really want to have kids, and so we don't want to wait very much longer.  this 

Recording: (452/ 2140) 
 Yeah, it is. And it seems to me that they don't keep the very, very best of the kids in state, but it gets a lot of the, like, just below the absolute best in.  And it keeps a lot of them here. 

Recording: (453/ 2140) 
 Yeah, it's my daughter. Yeah. 

Recording: (454/ 2140) 
 And we had like tapes we listened to with native speakers. So you got really good really quick 

Recording: (455/ 2140) 
 Um... 

Recording: (456/ 2140) 
 because they feel they have the need for it. There's so many golfers. I mean, sports went sky high. My mom used to play golf growing up and they only let the  on the golf courses one day a week, which is amazing. It was like on a Tuesday. And when I lived in Florida, a lot of the courses were like that too. And I thought, they're only allowing women one day a week?  You know, isn't that amazing? There's so many good women golfers now, but they said they're too slow and they always talk and that just killed me when my mom, that's the only day she's ever been in a wheelchair. 

Recording: (457/ 2140) 
 with 

Recording: (458/ 2140) 
 where she works and this is just OSU's breast cancer place. 

Recording: (459/ 2140) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (460/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (461/ 2140) 
 And so basically they decided to build a new building adjacent to the church, Tacton. And we, they  I asked the choir for input. 

Recording: (462/ 2140) 
 I think it fills its niche. I mean, Wexner has a niche and the museum has a niche.  and I think it fills it very well. 

Recording: (463/ 2140) 
 What happened was we know one of the people on our committee teaches in the math department here. 

Recording: (464/ 2140) 
 Oh, I'm not shocked at the bad behavior of the animal. I don't consider it's justice. 

Recording: (465/ 2140) 
 Just like almost out of control. 

Recording: (466/ 2140) 
 I don't know. She doesn't move anymore and she has to. I'm the one that loves to exercise. 

Recording: (467/ 2140) 
 If you come from a situation like that, that doesn't mean you have to be like that. Do you know what I mean? 

Recording: (468/ 2140) 
 I think so, I think so. If you're willing, you know, anybody who's willing to put out the effort. I mean you do have to, you know, you have to sell yourself. There's, you know, you're not going to just sit around and wait to be discovered.  But if you put out the effort, I really don't think there's that kind of discrimination anymore. 

Recording: (469/ 2140) 
 Yeah, and I think, I'm a firm believer that little subtleties like that to yourself are much better than looking in the mirror and going, look at them hips. And you go,  this way and you go, I'm getting a gut. And you know, it's like, that's so negative to yourself. Would you tell your mom that? You know? 

Recording: (470/ 2140) 
 They'd never say anything terrible to you or anything, but it was just sort of, you know, that feeling of, 

Recording: (471/ 2140) 
 I'm working here, but work-studying. 

Recording: (472/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (473/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (474/ 2140) 
 But you guys, the thing is just you have all these people in your  gotta keep their attention for like an hour or two. 

Recording: (475/ 2140) 
 There were people I met through friends. Actually, one of my friend's parents had a friend that was gay.  and just be over there or whatever. I mean, I can't say there's any big difference between. 

Recording: (476/ 2140) 
 Well, the PSATs and the, you know, just all those centralized scoring systems they have, they pretty much told me  that you know my scores when I was in what was it fifth grade yeah fifth grade they said that I was  I had a high IQ and I could be doctor, lawyer, yada yada yada. 

Recording: (477/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (478/ 2140) 
 And why? What? He's too busy? 

Recording: (479/ 2140) 
 like, you know. 

Recording: (480/ 2140) 
 Took a lot of time. 

Recording: (481/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (482/ 2140) 
 They just called me on the phone not knowing, you know, just that she went to the hospital. Well, they said to me, will you stay? Well, I said yes, but then as  When it got into two weeks and I wasn't getting any support from the principal or no aid or anything It's like I'm sorry. I'm a substitute  Substitute, I'm getting $60 a day. I can't do this unless I have more help. And I just flatly said that. 

Recording: (483/ 2140) 
 And that's what we did. And so he's just like my own too now. I go and volunteer. He's in kindergarten. I go and volunteer in his classroom too. So it's kind of like, I hope I get to do this forever. 

Recording: (484/ 2140) 
 and they do everything they possibly can to make me happy. And it's like my oldest girl, we're expecting our first grandchild here within a couple weeks.  She and I see each other all the time. My daughter, who goes to Ohio State, chose to live at home because she just said it was just a better situation for her.  It's not that these girls aren't independent and can't do it on their own. My second daughter could have lived on her own from the time she was 12. I mean, she's just very, very  and we'll see you next time. 

Recording: (485/ 2140) 
 short essay for a test. But the way that I would grade those would be pretty scientific, I think. I'd come up with a rubric and I would  say you need to mention certain things, and I'll give certain points for your mentioning certain things.  I've never been a teacher who's had to assign or grade creative writing. I'm not sure I would know how to do that. 

Recording: (486/ 2140) 
 you know, talk to her, but people don't, when I was 14, I didn't care what anybody told me. I was going to do it no matter what. 

Recording: (487/ 2140) 
 Yeah, I think I got really good. I've actually been sitting thinking about it, like what departments in the school were good and which ones weren't. The foreign language is really good.  They have immersion classes from like second level. 

Recording: (488/ 2140) 
 I'll raise them the best way I can. 

Recording: (489/ 2140) 
 It counts if you're touching the ground or if something that you're sitting on is touching 

Recording: (490/ 2140) 
 Um, actually, I was over there when all of that happened, but of course it was all over the papers and, you know, I think, I mean, I don't know what...  what it was like really here. I can imagine, but I mean, there especially, they really focused on not Columbine, but the one with the younger kids in Arkansas. Was it  I was there for both of those, but in the first one, they put the picture of the little kid in combat gear holding the gun everywhere. 

Recording: (491/ 2140) 
 Let's watch 7 to 9. 

Recording: (492/ 2140) 
 I was  which is fascinating. But, you know, I mean, our first day, I walked in, he said, hey, I'm Tom. You ever smoked pot before?  I was like, no. He said, we got a whole year together. And I'm directly quoting. That is the first thing he said to me. That is the first thing 

Recording: (493/ 2140) 
 and the second tornado. It wasn't as bad. I mean, we was driving up after he ripped me off and he said, well, I'm taking your sorry ass.  back to Columbus and I said okay go for it. I'm just sitting there smiling all the way up, knowing what he didn't know. We get the tennis  see and the weather is kind of bad there too. I'm like, hey man, slow down. You don't have any windshield wipers in the middle of this rainstorm. 

Recording: (494/ 2140) 
 Right. 

Recording: (495/ 2140) 
 I hope so, yeah. 

Recording: (496/ 2140) 
 And so I think it gets driven home. I think the media does that in a lot of places. They pick something that's sensational and keep... They're making it.  even more sensational, like when John Kennedy died. 

Recording: (497/ 2140) 
 It's really beautiful out there. We like mountains and walking around. We got married in Lake Tahoe, which is really beautiful. 

Recording: (498/ 2140) 
 Bye. 

Recording: (499/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (500/ 2140) 
 He is a picky eater, which he, yeah, he doesn't like everything. 

Recording: (501/ 2140) 
 Like, it's everything pretty much, I mean, like basic stuff that you, it would be like, you know, like a Lazarus or something like that, you know, or.  or a bunch of places like electronics, appliances, 

Recording: (502/ 2140) 
 If there were any Germans in there, I'll bet they're scared. 

Recording: (503/ 2140) 
 And I would just hear things. 

Recording: (504/ 2140) 
 Me too. 

Recording: (505/ 2140) 
 Um, I'm a Lutheran and a lot of what he says about everyone going to hell 

Recording: (506/ 2140) 
 as back in the high school. 

Recording: (507/ 2140) 
 I  and stuff like that with them. 

Recording: (508/ 2140) 
 Well, the crime you can't really stop and other things that happen. Just too much partying around.  left 12th Avenue because I couldn't you know but you know just everybody on the neighbors being loud and everything my mom's older so she can't really put up with it  any of that. 

Recording: (509/ 2140) 
 Like, I'm not really sure how the interview works to become a teacher.  I don't know. I think it's like a lot of times. They're really desperate to find people and so they really just take whoever I mean They're lucky enough to even have a body  to fill the place and they're doing well enough. I mean, the kids are learning the material, I mean, sort of. I mean, it's working well enough, I guess. 

Recording: (510/ 2140) 
 North. 

Recording: (511/ 2140) 
 That goes with the disorder. They know who's button to push and when not to push a button and how far they can go and where the line is.  and they push you always. That's why teachers, they drive the teacher up the wall. 

Recording: (512/ 2140) 
 I think society of today is less tolerant of a lot of things that they see where people getting by with stuff, you know, and they're more vocal.  about it as opposed to being violent about it. Back in the 60s and stuff, you know, not here, but you know, down south there were people still  getting hung and stuff for being a black or something. And there are bad blacks and there's bad whites too. 

Recording: (513/ 2140) 
 well. 

Recording: (514/ 2140) 
 I 

Recording: (515/ 2140) 
 You know, so you can use all those opportunities to show your kid what not to do. 

Recording: (516/ 2140) 
 Well, I mean, to me the whole thing is wrong, regardless of if you're guilty or innocent. To me, there's worse things, I would think, than dying. I know in Israel,  Israel, the guy who killed Yitzhak Rabin, he got locked up and he's not allowed to see it because under Jewish law you can't kill. 

Recording: (517/ 2140) 
 and now it's our turn to deal with the issues. We see our parents, we see this generation, all these things that are still popular, so we don't look down on the 60s. I think the 60s sound  and like a pretty fun time to live. I'll get into politics in a second. But those things are popularized, but no, we can't do it anymore because we've got all these problems.  and the other ones. 

Recording: (518/ 2140) 
 Cause they wouldn't let him when I was there. 

Recording: (519/ 2140) 
 I'm not sure. 

Recording: (520/ 2140) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (521/ 2140) 
 Yeah. I don't really have any childhood recollections of California. Yeah. 

Recording: (522/ 2140) 
 Yeah, he's teaching us system five. It's just funny. 

Recording: (523/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (524/ 2140) 
 But I think I like that, how it's kept with a sort of tension and it's not like, you know, they're not completely thrown together.  like B'Elanna and Tom, which I don't like that at all. 

Recording: (525/ 2140) 
 And he couldn't have any kind of caffeine, otherwise he'd get the shakes and he took all kinds of pills. 

Recording: (526/ 2140) 
 I'm 52. 

Recording: (527/ 2140) 
 Oh, exactly. I'm planning on just staying in the house if I can. Or what not. Oh yeah, yeah. I know. I mean we're gonna get some water and what not because you don't know people  might turn things off, like you said. 

Recording: (528/ 2140) 
 Microsoft. Linux? I don't know. I think Linux will be around forever just because it's such a stable system. It's so good.  And yeah, and Macintosh will stay around forever just because Macintosh is invincible  their obituary a year ago. 

Recording: (529/ 2140) 
 I don't know. Do you know anything about Unix? 

Recording: (530/ 2140) 
 I know I didn't think that much about it. Oh, well, I'm not doing anything else. Why not?  It seems kind of silly to legally have—  two levels. I mean either you're going to do it the hard way or you're not. 

Recording: (531/ 2140) 
 Wow. 

Recording: (532/ 2140) 
 The problem is lack of commitment. Lack of commitment and not saying, hey, there's a niche for you. You can't be a male. Oh, yeah, you want to do the operation? I can't be female.  Why not be happy what you are? God made you what you are. Why not make you the complete person you are and not strive for something you can't be? 

Recording: (533/ 2140) 
 Right. 

Recording: (534/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (535/ 2140) 
 I went to OU for about three months, but I just got out of school, you know how it is. 

Recording: (536/ 2140) 
 Oh, really? I was like, whoa, milk and Twizzlers. 

Recording: (537/ 2140) 
 Amen. 

Recording: (538/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (539/ 2140) 
 short north. It's in the short north. But it's so much fun. It's absolutely so much fun because it's really weird. You  normally  seven guys come up to him in one night and they're just like, can you do that for me? 

Recording: (540/ 2140) 
 that ran down, oh, 100, 200 yards from the gun position. So we took off down there. 

Recording: (541/ 2140) 
 you 

Recording: (542/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (543/ 2140) 
 I think there might be, but I think most of them are a dying breed. They're the older citizens. Many in my generation, they'd probably be  I'm the first of the baby boom. That's when the women's movement started. Many men still haven't accepted that.  for the generations, even the later baby boom generations behind me. When I talk to them, I talk to high school students or even young college students. 

Recording: (544/ 2140) 
 No, no, they didn't. They didn't pay for grading or preparing your classes or researching anything. So  Right, but but still even though it was real a very much underpaid job. I I liked it when I did it I liked the  introduction to the arts class because I had to develop my own curriculum for it. Right. They had a when they told me I 

Recording: (545/ 2140) 
 Yeah 

Recording: (546/ 2140) 
 the beginning of the end. Yep, I grew up in Upper Arlington. Yeah, really those five miles make such a  a difference though. Yeah, because I live on campus. 

Recording: (547/ 2140) 
 you 

Recording: (548/ 2140) 
 Well, it's not that there's been too much growth. I mean, growth is good, but now they need to stop. 

Recording: (549/ 2140) 
 Well, it's not how it's put into effect, the law, it's how it's enforced. You don't just say, well,  You know, little Johnny stuck his finger in a pie and you can't do that anymore. The more security you're going to have over that pie, the more he's going to want it.  Yeah. So, and going into the gun thing, it's pretty much nobody's winning game. I mean, you make stricter laws. 

Recording: (550/ 2140) 
 And so you had. 

Recording: (551/ 2140) 
 Oh ja. 

Recording: (552/ 2140) 
 The direction is being pushed, or they are being pushed. 

Recording: (553/ 2140) 
 They just got different beliefs. She believes I mean like one thing she believes all men will cheat 

Recording: (554/ 2140) 
 Yeah, much too fast for me. 

Recording: (555/ 2140) 
 but it's not going to work. I mean, if you're around people, I mean, number one, they're around their parents and their siblings, and that's socialization.  You go to church or to the library or wherever, I mean you're around people and you're around children and they get to  I  you 

Recording: (556/ 2140) 
 There's apartments above them. 

Recording: (557/ 2140) 
 I wouldn't. 

Recording: (558/ 2140) 
 Hmm, where from? 

Recording: (559/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (560/ 2140) 
 Just carrying around a gun and shooting someone. 

Recording: (561/ 2140) 
 He hasn't questioned me like that, but I see a lot of things coming out. He's doing more in line. He's been doing things a lot more differently than my daughter, because my daughter was away at school, and he  He's with us every day, he stays home, he doesn't want to stay on campus. He does things voluntarily, we don't have to coach him.  team 

Recording: (562/ 2140) 
 Well, I think a little bit safer idea than eliminating guns, because you know there's always going to be weapons out there.  Instead of eliminating the problem, more centralized it, make it a national law that you have to be a certain age.  Give a certain time period for your background checks and whatever else kind of record finding they need make sure you're 

Recording: (563/ 2140) 
 Commodore 64 is. They've heard of it, but they really don't know what a brilliant system it was at its initial stage.  and it just got bowled over because, you know, something better came out. Something better will come out than Windows. Microsoft will eventually go under.  It's just going to take a while. Oh yeah. I give it probably about six or seven years before somebody comes out with a system that's just as good as mine. 

Recording: (564/ 2140) 
 and just shows the ignorance in so many people. That really still bothers me. There's still so much of that going on.  you 

Recording: (565/ 2140) 
 you 

Recording: (566/ 2140) 
 factory, there's a, not really, there's all sorts of, there's all sorts of industry in the Mansfield area, but there's a lot of it.  Most of it stayed.  a while. Yeah, we've got the Mansfield State Reformatory where Shawshank Redemption was recorded. 

Recording: (567/ 2140) 
 Ninja Turtle, all the kids went into that just so intensively and they were supposed to be real good guys, but I mean the visual  was pretty miserable. In my opinion, they wore these masks and hoods and 

Recording: (568/ 2140) 
 Yeah, he uses a lot of different slurs towards gay people.

 Mm-hmm.

 Yes.

 with people who want them. 

Recording: (573/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (574/ 2140) 
 Yeah, they do. Their trains are so cool. I love those.

 and then once a month we'll have a leadership module which is the business ethics part and you know goal setting and that type of thing. And then once a month  month we'll just have Donato's pizza and just discuss basic general things. Events coming up, we planted the flowers  at Mirafield last weekend and the weekend before. I don't know. I can't wait for it to start just because I want to watch it on TV. I'm like, I planted those. 

Recording: (576/ 2140) 
 Well, there that went, you know. Why, I mean, you can't even have nice stuff in your car anymore. 

Recording: (577/ 2140) 
 plus the mental health aspect of it and everything. 

Recording: (578/ 2140) 
 No, it's very much so. 

Recording: (579/ 2140) 
 I don't think I would want my kid to go to daycare. Crazy. 

Recording: (580/ 2140) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (581/ 2140) 
 that he remembers. He remembers the stepfathers and that kind of thing. It's just not a good stuff. 

Recording: (582/ 2140) 
 for a long period of time. 

Recording: (583/ 2140) 
 This poor... 

Recording: (584/ 2140) 
 And they're less hyper about like, you know, bad things for people to do, you know, the drinking, the smoking. They're just not as strict about it.  it basically. 

Recording: (585/ 2140) 
 I can't see it. 

Recording: (586/ 2140) 
 And then the people that enjoy you think, why are we hiring these guys? What are they thinking? 

Recording: (587/ 2140) 
 You did, I. 

Recording: (588/ 2140) 
 Really? 

Recording: (589/ 2140) 
 you. 

Recording: (590/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (591/ 2140) 
 I think it should be my way. And I think the material should be there. I think it should be dealt with in a calm and reasonable way. And I think it should be accessible to the kids.  you 

Recording: (592/ 2140) 
 I guess so. I hope that they can keep the school somehow for kids and but it won't be him running  it 

Recording: (593/ 2140) 
 Yeah, I got a son, he's a senior at Audubon. 

Recording: (594/ 2140) 
 So. 

Recording: (595/ 2140) 
 So they get more buying power if they go there, okay. 

Recording: (596/ 2140) 
 I  it. You ever try to work for something? I mean you really struggled to achieve something? Did it mean more to you than something that was given to you? Tell me. 

Recording: (597/ 2140) 
 There's literally hundreds of library publications. And it's a problem that librarians are facing all the time. They can't keep up. 

Recording: (598/ 2140) 
 I moved into the dorms late September, last fall. 

Recording: (599/ 2140) 
 no sunlight, you know, and they don't give him, they keep it warm and he's not allowed sheets or razors or, you know, other than electric razors so he can't kill himself. So you're  stuck. There's nothing you could do all day for 40 years or however until he naturally dies. And that to me would be like that to me is actually like that has to be worse.  Like, just the agony and the... I think you'd have to go insane. There's really so much you... I'd ask for board games or something, but like, he doesn't even hear a human voice. 

Recording: (600/ 2140) 
 I'm not. 

Recording: (601/ 2140) 
 I've got nothing against Christianity, but I got something against the way it was brought here. 

Recording: (602/ 2140) 
 There's, you know, just I had three spiritual leaders tell me that a great gift came with that.  that there was, it was no accident. It was supposed to happen. And there's a word called synchronicity. 

Recording: (603/ 2140) 
 we're at least every other year we're out there. 

Recording: (604/ 2140) 
 Uh huh, uh huh. 

Recording: (605/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (606/ 2140) 
 I mean, there's nothing bad about them or anything that they... 

Recording: (607/ 2140) 
 Does your husband like that? 

Recording: (608/ 2140) 
 six years ago. 

Recording: (609/ 2140) 
 And it only took less than two months.

 Yeah.

It's a really, really cool house. 

Recording: (612/ 2140) 
 Hehe 

Recording: (613/ 2140) 
 The Columbus race showed that. He crossed gender lines, he crossed party lines, he crossed over into all of the city.  winning even Dorothy Teeter's precinct, which surprised me. And not by just a little small margin, I think it was 200 and some votes, which is pretty substantial. 

Recording: (614/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (615/ 2140) 
 One of the hardest. 

Recording: (616/ 2140) 
 It's just been my experience, unfortunately. I hope it gets better, but like I said, I haven't been ever  ever told that my degree matters by any employer. Contrary to what the news tells you and what people will tell you, oh go get that  college degree. You know, people told me as soon as I got out of college that I needed a master's.  MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다. 

Recording: (617/ 2140) 
 So I pretty much, it's not stressful at all. It's really easy. It's not challenging. 

Recording: (618/ 2140) 
 We're getting more fun stuff all the time, but predominantly it's still got way too much cow town personality. 

Recording: (619/ 2140) 
 I mean, there are gays in Congress, there are gays in the military. As long as people don't know, they don't feel threatened. I don't understand that mindset.  I really don't. I don't know why a man feels threatened by having a gay near them. I have a couple of gay friends and one of my friends always says,  Does every man like every woman he sees? Is he attracted to every woman? Does he want to go to bed with every woman? What makes a man think that just because

 Really?

 To Abbe House.

 and  you have to install a disk drive 

Recording: (623/ 2140) 
 they're confused. I don't know that saying home is for everyone and I don't think parenting is for everyone and it really makes me sad.  sad when I see somebody, you know, we just want our 

Recording: (624/ 2140) 
 Yeah. So that worked out. So I really hadn't dated for a long time and then I started dating again. And what's weird is you almost go right back in.  to the patterns because you're so scared you're going to be alone. You see yourself going, oh I can be with this person and you know in your head, this person's not for you.  And then luckily, indirectly, I met my husband. 

Recording: (625/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (626/ 2140) 
 Yeah, 84. 

Recording: (627/ 2140) 
 Right. 

Recording: (628/ 2140) 
 They have honors classes which are separate and they're supposed to be with better faculty and smaller class size and a little more challenging.

 Right? But how old is your kid?

 grade we were already writing cursive already. That's all she writes in now. I mean it seemed like they were teaching it then maybe. You might be learning something. Yeah. She's  in fractions, she's doing fractions, she's doing percentages already in second grade. And I thought we were one plus one, two plus, you know, in second grade. It's just  Seems like they're three years ahead. 

Recording: (631/ 2140) 
 Yeah, I don't know. 

Recording: (632/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (633/ 2140) 
 civil rights only went so far. They haven't corrected the wrongs in the past. They haven't created  a sense in our society that anyone can achieve. Like the American dream in my opinion is an absolute lie. 

Recording: (634/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (635/ 2140) 
 I live in Albany, therefore I'm cool. 

Recording: (636/ 2140) 
 Franklin Park South is wonderful too, Franklin Park out east is beautiful too off of East Broad Street. Now that's volunteer also, their guards are volunteer.  They're on a grand scale. That's where the conservatory is. 

Recording: (637/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (638/ 2140) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (639/ 2140) 
 Yeah, why not take advantage of this? Yeah, why not take advantage of that? 

Recording: (640/ 2140) 
 because it's hard for us to deal with. 

Recording: (641/ 2140) 
 and just get out there and have fun. And then we lift probably four days a week. I know I don't look like it, but I go with them and have a good time.  So... 

Recording: (642/ 2140) 
 My sister-in-law is one of them. She is just too stupid. 

Recording: (643/ 2140) 
 No, I don't fear none of the kids. 

Recording: (644/ 2140) 
 Just things like a waste of legislation, money. 

Recording: (645/ 2140) 
 Well, according to government, she would have. 

Recording: (646/ 2140) 
 that once you filter it through something it looks different but previous to that, yeah, there's a lot there. There's way too much shared experience to gloss over effectively. So when she said  Look, if you never listen to anything else that I say, you will listen to this. You need to go to Europe. I was like, OK, I'll go to Europe. 

Recording: (647/ 2140) 
 She did. My ex-wife did. I would have preferred her to continue going to school, but she had some problems with some students and stuff. 

Recording: (648/ 2140) 
 I see it as a problem and if I were African American I would not like to see it simply because  Because it's a child not being brought up in his tradition. But on the other hand, I  I hate to see a child left in foster care or in an orphanage when he can have a home. 

Recording: (649/ 2140) 
 you ask is it okay for us to do it and now with her I can have dishes out there in the  that are left there for breakfast and maybe lunch and she'll walk out there and I'll say, well, Grandpa, how come you're digesting that?  aren't done and then she turns around walks away. That's right uh-huh and and she may then 

Recording: (650/ 2140) 
 And you're not being recorded now. 

Recording: (651/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (652/ 2140) 
 But why would you make stricter gun laws when you can't even force your traffic laws? 

Recording: (653/ 2140) 
 That's right. In other words, it's so much me anymore instead of us and we. 

Recording: (654/ 2140) 
 Bye! 

Recording: (655/ 2140) 
 getting them someplace stable. 

Recording: (656/ 2140) 
 I'm not. 

Recording: (657/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (658/ 2140) 
 and you're like, oh, I'm going to a high school prom or something. That part's a little awkward, but I mean, I can't say it's really any different or anything.  I want to get back to what we were talking about earlier with the violence and kids and  In today's youth, they watch so much TV and listen to all this violent music and they play these violent video games like Doom or whatever.  Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (659/ 2140) 
 I do believe that in some cases the parents or the responsible adult should be found guilty.  I'm guilty of that. 

Recording: (660/ 2140) 
 No. No. 

Recording: (661/ 2140) 
 Yeah, I know. 

Recording: (662/ 2140) 
 No. 

Recording: (663/ 2140) 
 Good! 

Recording: (664/ 2140) 
 Not necessarily, but you know, I'd like him to be the candidate. 

Recording: (665/ 2140) 
 I like seeing them grow up together. 

Recording: (666/ 2140) 
 Excuse me, but you know what I mean. 

Recording: (667/ 2140) 
 in LA and then over the next two, three years my sister comes back and forth, no actually  I lived here for several months, I lived there for several months. 

Recording: (668/ 2140) 
 Yeah, I'm North and I can't even say that. Okay. 

Recording: (669/ 2140) 
 Yeah, real bad and it was, you know, mainly no one talked about it. 

Recording: (670/ 2140) 
 Oh, really? 

Recording: (671/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (672/ 2140) 
 different. 

Recording: (673/ 2140) 
 They can be paying me to go to finish high school and they can also, they'll also pay me to finish college and they'll help me out. I haven't seen anyone.  you 

Recording: (674/ 2140) 
 He cleans his. 

Recording: (675/ 2140) 
 I don't think that really matters honestly. I mean it's, I mean by the time you get into the Boy Scouts you're usually  eighth grade or something like that seventh eighth grade and up and I think by that time most kids have at least a general idea of who they are and what they like  I 

Recording: (676/ 2140) 
 crime and stuff. I mean a lot of it is just a strong economy now that may have started during the Republican years and carried over.  But people have been better off financially overall. And I don't think he's made any—I  say he's made major mistakes. 

Recording: (677/ 2140) 
 Yeah, my aunts do. 

Recording: (678/ 2140) 
 Yeah, I mean you generally could, I mean they didn't broadcast it obviously but... 

Recording: (679/ 2140) 
 Yeah, you're right. 

Recording: (680/ 2140) 
 I picked up one kid, he had been in, he was only about 15, he was adopted.  And he ran away. 

Recording: (681/ 2140) 
 I don't know, I saw it in the paper. Some kid was suspended because he had a paper. He drew a picture of a gun and cut it out. 

Recording: (682/ 2140) 
 for the system they have now. Keep punching the old card data into that. That was my first library job. 

Recording: (683/ 2140) 
 like that war divided people. But I would tell many, many women that they had to vote for Clinton because it was the difference between protecting Roe versus Wade and not  and in protecting choice. I'm starting to see that now even in the Gore campaign. I've seen a couple of editorials in the paper.  about the next president will again have an opportunity to appoint two to three Supreme Court justices. And if you want to protect that right, you've got 

Recording: (684/ 2140) 
 You mean at OSU? 

Recording: (685/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (686/ 2140) 
 But now he's with that girl he was cheating on with. He's with her now. They live together. So he's like going through a pattern too. And I he's a very they're like the real nice people.  It's just they just, I feel like they don't, and I try to tell them, don't mess up again. I just like, grow up, grow up. 

Recording: (687/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm, right. Education, definitely. And it's military. So. 

Recording: (688/ 2140) 
 So she's, and hopefully they'll get married soon. They've been together for over a year and a half. 

Recording: (689/ 2140) 
 Oh yeah, there's got to be unconditional love out there. 

Recording: (690/ 2140) 
 I think when you have two or more pets, you have to make a little bit more effort. 

Recording: (691/ 2140) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (692/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (693/ 2140) 
 I am and they are. My wife wasn't. 

Recording: (694/ 2140) 
 You like the university level. 

Recording: (695/ 2140) 
 Hate crime is an interesting term. All crimes, all murders are hate related. I'm not sure  It's difficult. We had civil rights laws. Many people were opposed to those.  but it was in an effort to correct years of institutionalized racism. 

Recording: (696/ 2140) 
 Starting over means putting a new operating system on it. 

Recording: (697/ 2140) 
 You know? 

Recording: (698/ 2140) 
 Well, when I was a senior in high school, I wish my parents would have pushed me to do something practical, but I'm glad they didn't because it gave me a chance to make my own decisions. 

Recording: (699/ 2140) 
 I think she'll end up coming here anyway. 

Recording: (700/ 2140) 
 What instrument do you play? 

Recording: (701/ 2140) 
 Yeah, I can't, you went to Europe and you missed Spain? Oh, okay.  See that'll be it you can plan that as a second honey move I'm sure your wife will object sure honey I can  I can do it. I can fit it in. So why did you decide to be ESPN?  you 

Recording: (702/ 2140) 
 I was a sinner. 

Recording: (703/ 2140) 
 heard about that, but the same principle applies. But I'm talking about just everyday things that people, if you want to talk about children,  primarily. There is no penalty anymore. Parents are scared to death to pick one up and spank  them, even with their bare hands, or to make them stand in a corner because they considered, and going back to the word, harassment, child abuse and harassment.  you 

Recording: (704/ 2140) 
 It's due December 2nd, but she's already dilating and everything, so the doctor had said before Thanksgiving, he thinks, you know. 

Recording: (705/ 2140) 
 Transit Authority. 

Recording: (706/ 2140) 
 We have a... yeah, we have. 

Recording: (707/ 2140) 
 And apparently that's a way of initiating a conversation. One of the guys I usually go clubbing with, he's the one who got me into the low stick dancing. And he said, there's like a sign that says, come hit on me.  Does it bother you at all?  If they start getting really pushy about it, I'm just like, I'm straight. But a lot of times it's really funny because I'll get in a conversation with them and they'll be like, you're straight, aren't you? I'm like, yeah. 

Recording: (708/ 2140) 
 Yeah, yeah. And the funny thing about that is if I heard one of those songs once, I might not be that turned off by it. But if you're going to play  played at me six times in three hours. 

Recording: (709/ 2140) 
 and then there's the one that's like, oh, I wish I had two weeks off at Christmas. Well, I used to work at Harding Hospital as a teacher when I first went to Worthington when I said I got another  job. I got a job working at Harding Hospital as the principal but I was also a teacher. So I taught part of the day and I was also the administrator. Because they had a small  school there for the kids that were in the adolescent unit and they were away from home and they had to go to school and get their credits somewhere. So the doctors always used to 

Recording: (710/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah, cuz I couldn't imagine rolling over on 

Recording: (711/ 2140) 
 and she did this and she did this and this. And they're going to go, oh, you know, it's like, you know, what do you want at the very end, you know? 

Recording: (712/ 2140) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (713/ 2140) 
 I mean, come on, who wasn't picked on, you know? 

Recording: (714/ 2140) 
 Is that right? 

Recording: (715/ 2140) 
 A lot of times he'll work for her dad. 

Recording: (716/ 2140) 
 that's accepted the cousin side yet. 

Recording: (717/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (718/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (719/ 2140) 
 So, then the security cops were above us and they were predominantly black. I don't know what happened. Something happened one time.  people in our whole platoon and it was all in the same barracks and some guy said something off-color to one of them or something like that.  and it got kind of out of hand for a while, but thank God nothing really happened. 

Recording: (720/ 2140) 
 Whoops. 

Recording: (721/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (722/ 2140) 
 Catholic schools. 

Recording: (723/ 2140) 
 Yeah, well I didn't realize that until I had kids. 

Recording: (724/ 2140) 
 We should be getting pretty near. 

Recording: (725/ 2140) 
 When I say I don't like the way it's heading, they're cramming so many houses and everything, and apartments and stuff. 

Recording: (726/ 2140) 
 They didn't like plot any weapon or anything like that, it was just fistfight, yeah. 

Recording: (727/ 2140) 
 That's fine. 

Recording: (728/ 2140) 
 a while. 

Recording: (729/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (730/ 2140) 
 like talking like I'm at work you know so it's like like the phone like 

Recording: (731/ 2140) 
 and they would ask, you know, can I do this, can I use this. Kids now, if I take my phone off and lay it on my desk, kids will walk right up and just take it. They won't ask me, they'll just go, oh. And then they start playing.  pushing button. Is this your phone? If I were at your house and I went in your bedroom and started messing with your stuff without asking you wouldn't like it much would you? 

Recording: (732/ 2140) 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (733/ 2140) 
 I don't have to put up with anyone's crap, but long drive and long distances is not good for me. Focusing, concentrating.  I've had several accidents, several tickets, I've even had  to other head injuries. 

Recording: (734/ 2140) 
 I'm finishing high school. I actually heard about a program where you can finish college on the internet. 

Recording: (735/ 2140) 
 Yeah, and it just didn't work. 

Recording: (736/ 2140) 
 There are two elderly women at the church, this has been about seven or eight years ago, father just mentioned that they had a need.  They had had a church bus and it had broken down so they had a need to get people to church and I met these two elderly women.  90, she turned 90 last October, and the other one is about 78 now. And they live together and I take them to church on Sundays. 

Recording: (737/ 2140) 
 Didja? 

Recording: (738/ 2140) 
 Before it wasn't that. You knew that if you had a problem, you could go and get something done with it. Now you can't get backing on it. 

Recording: (739/ 2140) 
 to heat in. 

Recording: (740/ 2140) 
 You know, because that will all go away about second grade. 

Recording: (741/ 2140) 
 yeah parents are very into this. my sister has no idea where she wants to go but they took me around all the different colleges to be sure what i wanted. interesting.  Go to OSU. 

Recording: (742/ 2140) 
 going to jump up and start hollering about my faith. And I won't walk into a coffee shop like a lot of my friends will and sit down and start talking to people.  I don't feel I'm ready to do that yet. I think there's a place and a time for doing certain things.  And this is one of the biggest things that people use as a reason for faith. 

Recording: (743/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (744/ 2140) 
 I teach a class on Thursday nights, how to play with computers. I play games on Tuesday nights. 

Recording: (745/ 2140) 
 Right. 

Recording: (746/ 2140) 
 here. 

Recording: (747/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (748/ 2140) 
 So that's why she's trying to get it out of the way now because you know the the the  He makes fairly decent money, so she doesn't have to work right now. But in order for them to move up the way they want to move up,  you know, after the baby comes, she will need to work. I have custody of another grandchild. 

Recording: (749/ 2140) 
 of all the off-campus kids to the police. And so they start driving around around 10.30 to try and bust them for noise on the weekends.  So it's pretty hectic. 

Recording: (750/ 2140) 
 They are, but it seems like they're going out instead of having, we don't do things in hotels and things because they have in-house. 

Recording: (751/ 2140) 
 Nothing's coming to mind now. 

Recording: (752/ 2140) 
 Real war. 

Recording: (753/ 2140) 
 support her living conditions or whatever. 

Recording: (754/ 2140) 
 Oh wow. So you have it on the speed dial. 

Recording: (755/ 2140) 
 and then remember back on it. 

Recording: (756/ 2140) 
 and to learn anything it had to be the same thing over and over and over again until he got it right. 

Recording: (757/ 2140) 
 Again, they set different rules. 

Recording: (758/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (759/ 2140) 
 They said, well, since you're getting that, we'll cut your pay back to what you would normally draw.  on your apprenticeship program. 

Recording: (760/ 2140) 
 And that's pretty much the way I felt the whole day, because I was just smiling on the inside. 

Recording: (761/ 2140) 
 Exactly. 

Recording: (762/ 2140) 
 It's just there we go again who's right who's wrong I have no idea 

Recording: (763/ 2140) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (764/ 2140) 
 Yeah 

Recording: (765/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (766/ 2140) 
 Yeah, so that's pretty much what she likes to do. 

Recording: (767/ 2140) 
 Yeah, it would be just one more thing. 

Recording: (768/ 2140) 
 It was mostly Caucasian and very few Asian and other ethnicities. 

Recording: (769/ 2140) 
 That's not true. I mean some of the older men and older tribes and different tribes 

Recording: (770/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (771/ 2140) 
 Yeah, but I mean, that's civilization-wide. 

Recording: (772/ 2140) 
 Yeah, and yeah, so I. 

Recording: (773/ 2140) 
 Well, I would sit down and talk to her. Like, you know, if you want to have sex, if you really want to have sex, you should get on some kind of birth control. 

Recording: (774/ 2140) 
 you know my husband and I were just talking about this I was saying I'm not in for the  you know, George Orwell, 1984, and Big Brother Syndrome and all. My ideal situation would be that  somebody decides who should have kids and who's not but I don't think God's gonna come down and do that so you know what I mean we can't really decide that but to be 

Recording: (775/ 2140) 
 So it's still just sitting down on my computer sits next to it. The only thing is you take it down, you can only have half a desk. 

Recording: (776/ 2140) 
 Yeah, I've lived with my mom since then. 

Recording: (777/ 2140) 
 just one school. So that's how many there was. 

Recording: (778/ 2140) 
 Yeah, and I get to argue about stuff there. Here, I'm just kind of sitting around. 

Recording: (779/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (780/ 2140) 
 and we'll just watch. Okay, come on, Scoony. He made it, okay, he made it in 30 seconds left. He made it, we win. Does that make the game interesting to you? 

Recording: (781/ 2140) 
 And I would definitely keep an eye out and figure out what's going on. 

Recording: (782/ 2140) 
 and I mean it's basically anytime I have free I mean it's not like I have a set schedule of when I have to work and things like that it's just whenever I feel like I have to do it. 

Recording: (783/ 2140) 
 then that was always her main focus. 

Recording: (784/ 2140) 
 Yeah, I went to Columbus Public Schools. Always over on the west side, same area of town. Always lived there. I live there now.  Came up here to OSU, got my bachelor's in English Lit, and then went to Case Western Reserve for a master's.  Then I decided I wanted to go somewhere else in the country, which I got my library degree, and the only job I could find was here in Columbus. 

Recording: (785/ 2140) 
 you know, and they, some of them spoke out where they should speak out. 

Recording: (786/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (787/ 2140) 
 But she's doing fine. She was dating somebody. I don't know whether they really got married or not, you know, because I don't really have that much communication with her, but some guy younger than her.  I talked to him, he seemed like a pretty decent guy. 

Recording: (788/ 2140) 
 But then you'll have to have people running the machinery and checking the machinery. 

Recording: (789/ 2140) 
 10-15 minutes. So yeah, we stay pretty close, see each other a lot. 

Recording: (790/ 2140) 
 And he goes, do you hear me? And I go, yeah. And he goes, you got a trip. Be out at the airport at 430. And I go, I don't know. He says, you hear me? And I go, yeah, yeah. He goes, well, get some sleep. And he turns the lights off and pulls the door shut.  I'm laying there, and I've been home three hours, and now I'm just fuming. I thought, I know a college education doesn't guarantee you  financial security. But I thought, what am I doing working from dawn to way past dusk, six days a week, and making 

Recording: (791/ 2140) 
 I said I didn't belong to any groups and that's not true. I belong to Ohio Designer Craftsmen. And in the shops they try to limit it to Ohio artists.  but the membership is national. So it's not really closed, it's just sort  of focusing on Ohio. 

Recording: (792/ 2140) 
 Or do you want to run over me? Is that what you want to do? 

Recording: (793/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (794/ 2140) 
 Well, yeah, sort of. 

Recording: (795/ 2140) 
 That's 

Recording: (796/ 2140) 
 No, and yeah, he's a mixture between Forrest Gump and Archie Bunker. 

Recording: (797/ 2140) 
 Whether it's over exaggerated or you know, none of us grew up shooting people or this, you know We don't own in firearms, but we played with guns and played count all these games  So I just wonder whether this is really, but society's a lot different now. 

Recording: (798/ 2140) 
 Oh yeah! 

Recording: (799/ 2140) 
 went shopping around for a new attorney. It took me about seven attorneys before I found  one that was adequate in terms of knowledge of head injury and brain injury because his father was a neurosurgeon and he had experience and expertise.  and bringing up the differences and the realities of a brain injury. 

Recording: (800/ 2140) 
 on. 

Recording: (801/ 2140) 
 Huh? 

Recording: (802/ 2140) 
 and where my mom was a young high school student, just graduating from high school.  They got together there, moved to California. 

Recording: (803/ 2140) 
 But if you love someone, you want them to do what's right and you want them to learn. And if that's the punishment they have to pay for something they did wrong, you still love them, but you're loving other people also.  In other words, you're not letting the fact, this is my child, so he can get away with murder, but this one over here, I'm not going to let him get away with it? No, I'm sorry, if my child committed something that this other one  would have had to pay for I'm sorry you've done that dear but and I love you dearly but I try to teach you different out where you went wrong I don't want to did wrong whatever but you got to pay the penalty  So 

Recording: (804/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (805/ 2140) 
 you know, which when you should is a better way of putting it. 

Recording: (806/ 2140) 
 My brother knows about it and my mother and that's the only ones in my family that are even aware of it. Because we just don't want to be bothered with all the questions. 

Recording: (807/ 2140) 
 understanding. 

Recording: (808/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (809/ 2140) 
 Everybody lives on a farm. 

Recording: (810/ 2140) 
 She would pamper the kids and well, from where we lived, we lived just all, I don't know whether you're acquainted with  north end of Columbus. But anyway, Indianola Avenue is one of the main thoroughfares. And we lived about a block and a half off of Indianola.  And then just another block was a small shopping center where there was a drugstore and a barber shop. 

Recording: (811/ 2140) 
 ADHD and they do this, they were trying to make it to where he would calm down and they wouldn't have to give him so much medicine.  and she reads a lot of magazines and articles about you know that problem and I guess he had if you changed  their diet if you take out milk or something. I think it was. Did you know Twizzlers had milk in them? 

Recording: (812/ 2140) 
 Aren't you holding it? 

Recording: (813/ 2140) 
 So... 

Recording: (814/ 2140) 
 Right. 

Recording: (815/ 2140) 
 I 

Recording: (816/ 2140) 
 Right. 

Recording: (817/ 2140) 
 Yeah, and everybody's going to associate with people that they feel comfortable with. So, you know. And unfortunately, as that guy, this guy in particular, he was the center for the football team.  team as he grew up older, you know, he realized that he wasn't as big as important as he, he blew out his knee for OU, you know.  But I went to school with Larry Hunter, who's the basketball coach for OU now.  you 

Recording: (818/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (819/ 2140) 
 They didn't make it into the history books, yeah. 

Recording: (820/ 2140) 
 that encompasses the theory that all things happen for a reason, even though it seems like it's  chaos, even though it seems like it's an accident. There's a flow of spirit in this world. Things  are moving at a pace that they're supposed to move at and things happen. And death is part of life, physical death. And that's 

Recording: (821/ 2140) 
 her husband is, believe it or not. They're not really, I wouldn't call them neat freaks, but we tease them because my parents and her live within a couple miles  of each other in Dublin and you have to take off your shoes when you go in which is really, it's amazing how good their carpet looks. 

Recording: (822/ 2140) 
 better head start on development so 

Recording: (823/ 2140) 
 No, because they're going to learn that on their own. I personally think that it's a choice. I don't think you're born that way because I have friends  that are homosexual and I don't believe in what they're doing but I don't do everything right every day. So I still love them and they're my friends and blah blah blah.  because but I've also known people that were that way and now are heterosexual and are much happier and they realize that it was just a choice they 

Recording: (824/ 2140) 
 Yeah, they are. 

Recording: (825/ 2140) 
 I am not agreeing with. My grandma, she seems to think, okay, maybe, but if you put a discount store in there, I would love it.  That's what she said I was like, okay 

Recording: (826/ 2140) 
 Right, wow. 

Recording: (827/ 2140) 
 So, yeah. 

Recording: (828/ 2140) 
 I wish they could. 

Recording: (829/ 2140) 
 Man I wish I knew what to buy this week 

Recording: (830/ 2140) 
 onto a house but it's just more time consuming than I think I'm ready 

Recording: (831/ 2140) 
 Get it from us. 

Recording: (832/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (833/ 2140) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (834/ 2140) 
 Yeah, and I wouldn't do that if I had no children. 

Recording: (835/ 2140) 
 So, but that's, you know, I ended up settling the attorney, got most of the money. What little I had, I invested some and then I made some bad investments when I went  off my medication and blew it. So that was my responsibility, my fault.  that, you know, how it was just years of pent-up frustration and I just, I 

Recording: (836/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (837/ 2140) 
 That's perfect. 

Recording: (838/ 2140) 
 Yeah, just one concert. 

Recording: (839/ 2140) 
 And I don't think that it is just executed properly. So I would almost rather have it not at all. 

Recording: (840/ 2140) 
 I don't hear you. 

Recording: (841/ 2140) 
 The women really don't need the sweat lodge, but it's there for them and they do participate. 

Recording: (842/ 2140) 
 The reason I asked was, it seems to me a lot of the impetus for going to church or going back to church for people is when their kid gets old enough to  Go to Sunday school. Starting asking questions about religion and you're saying, well, I suppose I could answer all these, but.  Yeah 

Recording: (843/ 2140) 
 Um, no English. 

Recording: (844/ 2140) 
 I don't think so. 

Recording: (845/ 2140) 
 Um, 

Recording: (846/ 2140) 
 Cry. 

Recording: (847/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (848/ 2140) 
 And part of it was just being stupid, but it was down around the Mount Vernon area and they got very little money.  but I wasn't hurt. 

Recording: (849/ 2140) 
 Right. 

Recording: (850/ 2140) 
 I'd say. And then I'd also say that, you know, because a number of reasons that people don't vote for school levies now is because they don't have kids in the schools. You know, but education is  the foundation of a democracy. And if you don't have an educated citizenry, your democracy could go down the drain. That was why Thomas Jefferson  and founded so many schools, or the University of Virginia, and believed in education, because he said, without an educated citizenry, you won't understand the issues. 

Recording: (851/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (852/ 2140) 
 WITH THAT BOY. 

Recording: (853/ 2140) 
 Mm-mm. 

Recording: (854/ 2140) 
 groups and different cliques, but I can't help but thinking that if it was bad enough that you would do something like that, that  It had to have been more than just normal jocks versus whatever.  So I think it should be more, I don't know, I mean even, you know, I went to a private 

Recording: (855/ 2140) 
 And you know, you have a hard thing there. But then if you teach the teachers that they're not going to be quiet and they're not going to, you know, look at this flattery. 

Recording: (856/ 2140) 
 Right. 

Recording: (857/ 2140) 
 Yeah, it sucked. 

Recording: (858/ 2140) 
 Uh-huh. 

Recording: (859/ 2140) 
 And I wouldn't be too opposed to do that myself if it would keep the cost down around here. 

Recording: (860/ 2140) 
 Time to go. All right, I'm done here. 

Recording: (861/ 2140) 
 Yeah, yeah, just sit on it. She's not allowed on the couch, but we had caught her last winter on the couch. You know, you come home and it's warm and, hey, there's a doggy bone  up here. 

Recording: (862/ 2140) 
 It'll be a long campaign. I thought it was interesting that Gore suggested two debates a week, and I just can't imagine what you  two debates a week for months. At least they could get things out into the open.  They have the chance, but who wants to watch that much? Who has the time to watch that much? 

Recording: (863/ 2140) 
谢谢 

Recording: (864/ 2140) 
 Heh heh heh. 

Recording: (865/ 2140) 
 Yeah, not for special conditions, nothing. Just universally, it's wrong. 

Recording: (866/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (867/ 2140) 
 private but no I wish those guys would just spell hey I'm a majoring in accounting I'm majoring in finance I'm majoring in business and I got  I got 3.5, I got 2.6. And whatever the criteria is to play on the team, why aren't you playing this week?  Well, I'm practicing. I'm still required to practice even though I can't play this week. Why can't you play? It's a rule. What rule? 

Recording: (868/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (869/ 2140) 
 Well, there was a house I didn't want it, so that was easy. 

Recording: (870/ 2140) 
 I, I, at one time I kind of wanted to be a teacher and everything, but of course that would have been, I'm 49, so I would have been probably  I'm about 24, so I've got about 25 years in, so I'd be ready to get the heck out anyway. 

Recording: (871/ 2140) 
 Right. 

Recording: (872/ 2140) 
 So basically, well yeah it might work, but to me it's kind of stupid, because what you're saying is we're going to take this law and we're really going to stick you on this law, but to hell with all the other ones.  So is that really fair? 

Recording: (873/ 2140) 
 It was back in the 60s. 

Recording: (874/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (875/ 2140) 
 I mean, I don't think they should get rid of it for Polaris thing. But there's plenty of malls to go to if that's okay.  It's not a big deal to me to tell you truth. No, actually I live, I live closer. I live east more.  more. 

Recording: (876/ 2140) 
 I remember it being a pretty positive thing for me. I was never upset about the fact that they weren't together because they both gave me a lot of attention.  About I think I was maybe five or six my mom moved into apartment in German village 

Recording: (877/ 2140) 
 Yeah, my brother, well, he's the oldest oldest, but two sisters pretty much all the ones I really care about, two sisters and  their husbands. 

Recording: (878/ 2140) 
 more expensive so everyone has a lot less. And here it's like everything is so relatively inexpensive that it's like, you know, picture frames or something there, it might be, you know, $25  for one, so you buy one here. Oh, they're $5 a piece, let's buy five. 

Recording: (879/ 2140) 
 Yep. 

Recording: (880/ 2140) 
 You're going to cross the street, you know, four-lane highway, and you're sitting there going, 

Recording: (881/ 2140) 
 around you but at night it's pretty fun and you just floor it and fly right through the middle of downtown. Improvements I would just say keep I would just say the  Man, this place is dirty. 

Recording: (882/ 2140) 
 Yeah. Well, I think chiropractors would be more popular for the same type of reason. Yeah. 

Recording: (883/ 2140) 
 Ha ha ha! 

Recording: (884/ 2140) 
 As he was speaking and as he started to speak, I realized too, another thing that I really feel has a tremendous impression on how we as people are doing here, but how the politicians are, is because the world  in essence is getting smaller because the communication has gotten better and all these other countries and us are just like all one country anymore or something and I think that's had a tremendous influence also on  our politics and on we as a people. 

Recording: (885/ 2140) 
 See you tomorrow. I mean hold them, feel the warmth of the body, hear the conversation quietly.  rather than hearing, okay, time to get out of here, you know, with a vigorous saying, but a pleasant sort of remark. These kind, I could elaborate, I could write a whole book on that.  on this on the answer your questions but it's these kinds of things are very elementary really they're very elementary I guess to 

Recording: (886/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (887/ 2140) 
 Right, right. He would go for weeks, he would get mad at me and not speak to me when I was growing up for a week or two at a time. My mother would say, please, Nance, I changed my name when I went to college. I just decided  I'm out of here, everything's gone. And so she would say, Nancy, please just talk to your father, just for my sake, please talk. And I would think, I'm the child here, I shouldn't have to.  to be the one to make peace in this family. If he doesn't want to talk to me, I don't need him. I don't have to talk to him. 

Recording: (888/ 2140) 
 Well, it's sort of like the sociology of like clicks, you know, like how how that develops like how people like some people seek to like fit in like  That's a real strong... 

Recording: (889/ 2140) 
 Really? Yeah, I don't feel old at all. I mean, a lot of people think, wow, you should know what you want to do. And I guess there is different phases.  Maslow's hierarchy what is that the hierarchy of needs Maslow anyway 

Recording: (890/ 2140) 
 I won't let him beat us right now. 

Recording: (891/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (892/ 2140) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (893/ 2140) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (894/ 2140) 
 Well, it was both, really, because there's kids who've lived there since I lived there. That was 13 years ago. And being that long in the same neighborhood just  I didn't really get it with me. 

Recording: (895/ 2140) 
 Yeah, from the strike, yeah. Actually, a lot of our stuff did pretty well while we were off, so it didn't make you feel as needed as you wanted to be.  We got a lot of our buildings up and running before they went on strike. And I think the bosses knew this was coming. So a lot of the air conditioning was already on.  running by then. 

Recording: (896/ 2140) 
 Yeah, exactly, I know. 

Recording: (897/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (898/ 2140) 
 It's always been my feeling, and I try to be fair in the way I grade. I try to be as objective as I can.  Sometimes I, because I think it's important that people learn how to write, I would ask all my classes to write an essay or a short. 

Recording: (899/ 2140) 
 You know? 

Recording: (900/ 2140) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (901/ 2140) 
 That's pretty extreme. 

Recording: (902/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (903/ 2140) 
 Oh gosh. 

Recording: (904/ 2140) 
 their IDs. I mean, the guys are trying to look older, the girls are trying to look younger. 

Recording: (905/ 2140) 
 Or then they had to, after that, they had to lottery number and that wasn't, if you were hot, you know, if you got, your number was picked, I mean, I don't know what should be worse, knowing that you're going to get a notice and being able to  to prepare for it or because I've had friends that got numbers and everything you know and getting a high number and sitting there going oh my god. 

Recording: (906/ 2140) 
 It was just, yeah, I guess the mafia was a big problem. They just take over everything and they don't pay their workers and most people aren't mafias.  Don't get paid. 

Recording: (907/ 2140) 
 But I do know my brother-in-law mentioned to his parents, gosh, what a sacrifice you guys did for us. And he's just turned 50.  And they don't have any kids. And he says, well, how you did it? Well, for one thing, they probably did a lot of sacrifice.  And when you sacrifice, it makes you more humble. 

Recording: (908/ 2140) 
 the younger kids wouldn't think anything about it. 

Recording: (909/ 2140) 
 a type of lifestyle and that lifestyle is gone. Everybody is independent, everybody is going their own ways and if you happen to be lucky enough to find somebody that is looking  in the same direction you are and is equally as independent, then it might work. But, you know, and who knows why each person gets divorced.  I mean, each one of them was an individual situation. 

Recording: (910/ 2140) 
 Right. 

Recording: (911/ 2140) 
 The watchtowers, yeah.  You can look it up and say, has anybody got their sights on me? Yeah. Because that's  It's like, you know, like, you know, that's like the World War II stuff, you know, there's like remains, I'm sure it's like, you get to see the wall, it's like, I mean, I'm sure there's like, from what I understand, it was like 

Recording: (912/ 2140) 
 you 

Recording: (913/ 2140) 
 So however this works out, you know, I don't know. I'm just like, okay. She just says, I just want to get it over with.  And see, now she, you know. 

Recording: (914/ 2140) 
 Oh really? 

Recording: (915/ 2140) 
 To be close, so I didn't have to drive. 

Recording: (916/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (917/ 2140) 
 See, that's great though. 

Recording: (918/ 2140) 
 So I mean basically my opinion on that is just leave it up to them. I mean if they want to take the risks obviously they know. 

Recording: (919/ 2140) 
 If you say buy, buy from those unscrupulous business people, they'll say, ah, gee, these guys can't have credit.  What happens to that person that files bankruptcy? Ah, bankruptcy, okay. I'll do something else next time. 

Recording: (920/ 2140) 
 Why really think that's happening right now? Because I think that I don't know what the divorce statistics have been recently, but I do see that more people who are getting married  married, are staying married, because those that would have gotten a divorce, they're not bothering to get married to begin with. They're just living together, and if they separate, so what? And I  I think that 

Recording: (921/ 2140) 
 Yeah, and it has the least amount of people, which is kind of neat as far as tourism. So. 

Recording: (922/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (923/ 2140) 
 I'm looking for a part-time job as we speak. I've been doing temporary on and off. The thing with that is you can work for four or five months and then nothing. And then  like that. So right now I'm looking for something permanent. 

Recording: (924/ 2140) 
 you know, just experiencing someone for who they are. And so she's 

Recording: (925/ 2140) 
 a couple restaurants or something. But I mean, it's different when you think of other cities, you know, it's more of like a downtown is where you go to hang out, but here it's like campus.  or more of a 

Recording: (926/ 2140) 
 It was just... So I didn't object to that one at all. 

Recording: (927/ 2140) 
 That would be seriously fun. But it depends. If you work industry, you get money. 

Recording: (928/ 2140) 
 ride. 

Recording: (929/ 2140) 
 Well, I 

Recording: (930/ 2140) 
 And they were just wild, you know. I just ran every minute. And I took it as a substitute and didn't know from day to day, you know, whether it was going to keep it. I finally had to say,  I can't do this. 27 kindergartens. I'm sorry, I can't do this by myself. 

Recording: (931/ 2140) 
 Me or 

Recording: (932/ 2140) 
 Yeah, drugs, right. Yeah, so that's what she's interested in right now. She's looking to see if she can find some place to work this summer.  even if it's just a day a week, some clinic or something, just to see what goes on day to day. 

Recording: (933/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (934/ 2140) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (935/ 2140) 
 That's Bishop Reedy. It's a Catholic school over on the west side. 

Recording: (936/ 2140) 
 And I just told them what it has to do with my belief system, so you're in violation of the First Amendment. And then they realized that I wasn't stupid.  So, you know, they just made things more and more difficult for me. So I just decided to, since they weren't going to change, I was just going to leave.  So, it's a hard way to choose to walk if you're an idealistic person. 

Recording: (937/ 2140) 
 Is it any worse than baseball cards? 

Recording: (938/ 2140) 
 and you said divorce is more acceptable. Divorce should never be acceptable. 

Recording: (939/ 2140) 
 Yeah, I had a cousin that went on, she was in school for that. And as you can tell, I like to do office work. 

Recording: (940/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (941/ 2140) 
 Yeah, that's how he gets so much money. He says, I will be paid this much, and I will be given this much minimum per day, or I'm not working for you.  And they usually say, no, no, no, we won't do that. And then they'll call back a week later. OK, we'll take you. He has some really good stories about that. Oh, yeah.  He just has qualifications with running businesses, is that why? He has qualifications with businesses and also with Unix, which is? 

Recording: (942/ 2140) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (943/ 2140) 
 a lot more places to live. It seems like everywhere I turn there's construction and you know you go down one road and then you wait a couple years if you don't go in that area  and it's all changed, it looks all different. So and that's mainly like looking up Bethel and 315 or things like that. 

Recording: (944/ 2140) 
 You know, he was in... Oh, yeah, they both worked during college. I guess my dad was on the GI Bill after the war, so that's how he got in here.  and had to work some part-time work to get his degree.  It's just East Broad Street, just Franklin Park, conservative. 

Recording: (945/ 2140) 
 I mean, that goes along with my customs and beliefs. I mean, we're going to send our child, I already know, to parochial schools. There's no way I'm going to send him to a public school.  and even my husband's a boy scout leader and just listening to the boys there he did a  last night on Respect. 

Recording: (946/ 2140) 
 The ultimate would probably be a part-time thing, but neither one of our positions offer any type of part-time work. We have some friends that do that where  they only go two days a week or something, which is, they get a little bit of both the world, so. 

Recording: (947/ 2140) 
 Do I think they will? Oh yes, I think they definitely will. I think there's so much heavy political and financial... Well, I'm going to reverse that statement. There's so much heavy financial...  influence upon the political influence that it is almost a foregone conclusion. And if it doesn't occur within this year,  and there may be another vote in another year or next election. But I think that in fact it will go. 

Recording: (948/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (949/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (950/ 2140) 
 You know? 

Recording: (951/ 2140) 
 Yeah, that's what I'm saying. 

Recording: (952/ 2140) 
 Yeah, yeah, they've had two different articles in there about it. Well, they had a big article back when It was a Jesse Jackson was down there or something  a couple years ago or something. And he made a concerted effort to try to let people know how much poverty is there.  down there and everything. But then you go to a lot of other extremes, you know, where you sit there and these people wouldn't want to live in Columbus. So. 

Recording: (953/ 2140) 
 I think he's done some positive things, that whole thing about as far as your student loans and being able to get into Scala, which has helped me.  As far as some of the issues go, I feel pretty similar to the way he does.  I think I've gone pretty decently. But I mean I think, I don't know. I mean, I don't 

Recording: (954/ 2140) 
 Yeah, from what I hear, actually, like the Emory and the University of Chicago, you have to work really hard because they get all the kids who wish they would have gotten to Harvard and then  start, you know, try to make it up by working harder. You get to actual Harvard, nobody works because they're like, we already made it, you know. 

Recording: (955/ 2140) 
 I well that's a that's a tough one I Remember when you know when we were we had you know some movies like  But they were like the Bowery boys and stuff, you know, where you pretty much knew it was all fake anyway, you know, but and to me that's fake  And I never really thought about while I was growing up that it was what was real and everything I always knew that by I dare again, you know by my dad being a 

Recording: (956/ 2140) 
 He's a disappointment. 

Recording: (957/ 2140) 
 Right. Right. 

Recording: (958/ 2140) 
 we'll do this and we'll do this. So we checked out the Catholic school and they were organized that way. And it just was a better match for him. And then my daughter  went to school, it was just easier to take him to the same school. And that goes back to another thing I wanted to say about why the discipline and behavior may  be different in the Catholic school is you're paying big bucks. You know, it's $4,500 a year for us to send her to school.  you 

Recording: (959/ 2140) 
 Yeah, I figure right now I might as well take advantage of it. 

Recording: (960/ 2140) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (961/ 2140) 
 businessmen. My dad and I have been screwing around with stocks for years. I've been in contact with a day trading firm down in West Virginia and they're starting an intern program sometime, I don't even know  win, but if that opens up, I will probably seriously consider going down to West Virginia.  I've been saying West Virginia, haven't I? They're in Virginia, sorry. Their home base is in Richmond, Virginia. 

Recording: (962/ 2140) 
 year and then I went into the Army in 1940, spring of 1941, before Pearl Harbor. I was in service for  four and a half years in Italy most of that time, North Africa and then Italy.  And I had met a girl before I went into service. 

Recording: (963/ 2140) 
 Then when I found out there were so many openings in special ed, so and then I found out later that speech therapy is a very good background for LD because  A lot of these LD kids have language deficits and language problems. They can't express themselves on paper or they don't process  things correctly, auditorily, so that's the perfect background to work with LD kids. I didn't know I was doing that at the time. 

Recording: (964/ 2140) 
 I made a difference. 

Recording: (965/ 2140) 
 That's great. 

Recording: (966/ 2140) 
 Yes and no. When we were in Boy Scouts, we got kicked out of it. 

Recording: (967/ 2140) 
 And well, the people that own it are starting to build it up now. But it's been like that. It was the first apartment community in Columbia.  It was built in 38, I guess. 

Recording: (968/ 2140) 
 People that lived there, we've got the Indian department stores right down there on High Street and a couple of Asian groceries.  I don't know where they live. I mean, it seems like for those stores to be opening there, they must be somewhere in Clintonville, but I don't know. 

Recording: (969/ 2140) 
 All right. 

Recording: (970/ 2140) 
 huh 

Recording: (971/ 2140) 
 I don't know I wouldn't personally like think that the parents should be held responsible. I mean they do have you know a certain amount of responsibility  for the fact that they should have been more aware and especially because I mean I believe that those, at least one of the two, had been in counseling and was doing  aggression management or something like that. You know, you would think that if they were going through something like that, you would just sort of, you know, maybe 

Recording: (972/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (973/ 2140) 
 Once the tourists hear about it, you know, it's like, you know. 

Recording: (974/ 2140) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (975/ 2140) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (976/ 2140) 
 Well, basically it's the same thing here. But some of your management is real good. I've seen people that are super, but I've seen people that are bad. The problem is you get a bad management.  And it can make your life hell. I don't care who you are. 

Recording: (977/ 2140) 
 All you do is you just keep your records of what you spend on things and then there's a form you fill out and how much you have if you've taken any depreciation you need to  basically put that back in and deduct your cost. And then there's a percentage that goes on your Schedule E that goes on the front of your form that goes into your income, and then it's just taxed.  It's just, it's really not that hard. 

Recording: (978/ 2140) 
 the 

Recording: (979/ 2140) 
 Yeah, I'm just learning the area, but I like it so far. It seems really nice. It seems like there's a lot more to do in Columbus, obviously.  But... 

Recording: (980/ 2140) 
 Why do I think that is? 

Recording: (981/ 2140) 
 everyone might experiment or try or make a mistake, but the way he's handling it saying I'm not even gonna dignify that question over and over and over. If he didn't do it, he might as well just be like no I didn't do it. 

Recording: (982/ 2140) 
 downtown, which is where one of my orchestras plays a lot. We sang in other different kinds of churches and said what we liked about them and what we didn't.  Maybe it had some feedback. I think the new building is acoustically very good. It's certainly much better than the old building.  Old Worship Center, because I don't know if you've seen a picture or anything of the church, but the Old Worship Center was designed by a modern architect to 

Recording: (983/ 2140) 
 At this point, I'm not against the urban schools, but if it was my own personal child, I would merge.  move to a suburban area until Columbus gets their act together. They are in such bad shape right now that I do think the state will take over the Columbus Public  schools in two years. Yeah. They've threatened it. And if they don't pull their scores up they will. You know. 

Recording: (984/ 2140) 
 and move on. That's basically my fear. But as one of the guys tried to help me,  said well listen I'm afraid of that too because right there in that pit there that's God. Now if you remember that there's nothing in here that can  hurt you, even as hot as it gets, you know. And when you think about that, you try not to think too much while you're in there. Although 

Recording: (985/ 2140) 
 Or they come back to visit me sometimes from the high school. 

Recording: (986/ 2140) 
 Yeah, it's ridiculous. Plus it's a nationally recognized school, so a degree from Ohio State, I mean, you could go anywhere in the nation, someone's at least going to recognize it because it's a big  It's a big big name Ashland. It'd be more of a sell I'd be like okay. We it's small. It's private. It's credited, but still 

Recording: (987/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (988/ 2140) 
 It doesn't matter how much money they're given for their education. 

Recording: (989/ 2140) 
 Yeah, I think mostly they did. I was kind of surprised. Which class was this? I think this was in that introduction to the arts class. I was  kind of surprised that one of the students in my class thought it was very hard. I didn't think it was that hard at all, but she wrote me some kind of nasty  you know at the last class or before the last class that she had a straight A average at the school before my class and I was giving her a B and she was her 

Recording: (990/ 2140) 
 He's proud of the fact that he did not cook. 

Recording: (991/ 2140) 
 I don't know where he got the contact, but anyway, he went up to Boone, Iowa and joined the National Guard out, which was field artillery.  and with the expectation of their being mobilized soon, which they were. And so he was home one weekend and talked to me about it.  and I went on field artillery. I was exposed to that when I was in ROTC at Ames, so I thought, let's be better than carrying 

Recording: (992/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (993/ 2140) 
 enough kids out there that need love. 

Recording: (994/ 2140) 
 But when it came down to it, what was the protest really about?  I'm not being clear because I'm not exactly sure where I'm going with this. I'm very cynical about the world I've inherited because I see a world in which my political views  have been silenced by 50 years of international politics and propaganda. 

Recording: (995/ 2140) 
 I went to, let me see, I applied to Emory, Harvard, Duke, University of Chicago, and Washington University. So I got into three of those.  They were neat places. 

Recording: (996/ 2140) 
 I have no idea. 

Recording: (997/ 2140) 
 Oh yes! 

Recording: (998/ 2140) 
 Yeah, he was up there too. The old guy with the beard and the tweed jacket. It was pretty cool. And they said most of  students are not even from Delaware. 

Recording: (999/ 2140) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (1000/ 2140) 
 Right, right. That's the amazing thing about this country is that there's enough space in the United States and North America that you can have all these incredible  monstrosity developments and still be able to find relatively wild places between them. 

Recording: (1001/ 2140) 
 Something to think about. 

Recording: (1002/ 2140) 
 Yeah, it's spring break. A couple of teachers are taking a bunch of kids. 

Recording: (1003/ 2140) 
 you know, they shouldn't know where the keys are, if there were keys to the gun cabinet or whatever. I mean, the fact that, you know, how do you explain your way out of your kids taking guns to  school. 

Recording: (1004/ 2140) 
 I 

Recording: (1005/ 2140) 
 they what they 

Recording: (1006/ 2140) 
 He's an educator, which is all the more reason to homeschool. Because he sees it and he's like, yeah, they. 

Recording: (1007/ 2140) 
 that is going to, well, it might make national news. I just. 

Recording: (1008/ 2140) 
 That's my dad has red hair and blue eyes, so. 

Recording: (1009/ 2140) 
 Okay, so um, Chris and I spent the rest of the evening calling people. I got it in my head that I didn't want anybody to  call and say, how's your dad doing? And so the best way to deal with that situation was to call globally, across the board. Plus it was a fun psychological experiment. Just as they go,  because how often do you get to tell people that the dude that just killed himself this morning? So I'm like, hi, how you doing? No, I haven't talked to you. 

Recording: (1010/ 2140) 
 Well, see, he moved into an apartment over on 11th Avenue. 

Recording: (1011/ 2140) 
 Right. 

Recording: (1012/ 2140) 
 you 

Recording: (1013/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1014/ 2140) 
 ground up bone. So my mom was working and it's going to sound sickening. I was 12 years old. I'd even have to come home from school and stick suppositories up on 

Recording: (1015/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1016/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1017/ 2140) 
 probably gonna light him again, you know, and then a lot of them I don't think are capable, well in the present condition I know like the print of my own talking about, there is no way in hell that he  get hold down a job. 

Recording: (1018/ 2140) 
 Yeah, and the smaller house, like bigger squished in areas, are the older area.

 to marry him and she moved over and 

Recording: (1020/ 2140) 
 and don't insult us anymore or we'll go to trial. So my attorney jumped it back up to $125,000. I couldn't take sitting there.  These guys going back and forth of what they felt I was worth. Even the arbitrator was an asshole. But that's the way that system works.  tomorrow. 

Recording: (1021/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1022/ 2140) 
 breastfeeding, there was a lot of that. I think it's all these poor guys are like, oh, we not talk about this. You know, they're all kind of uncomfortable. 

Recording: (1023/ 2140) 
 I said, you know, I don't know why you are insecure. I said, everything you do, you do well. I said, I try things and just bomb at them and I said, you just zip  through them and I said you maybe someday when you're older you'll look back and go oh I see what dad was talking about but she just can't see that 

Recording: (1024/ 2140) 
 I'm just kind of appalled at what they put on the news anyway. It's not usually what I consider news. It's a lot of human interest stories and things like that, which... 

Recording: (1025/ 2140) 
 So many normal people in! 

Recording: (1026/ 2140) 
 I wouldn't like it to be that way, but basically when I was in the service, the women had their own area of the service that they were allowed to be.  nurses and stuff, you know. 

Recording: (1027/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1028/ 2140) 
 And we really like her. We enjoy being with her, but sometimes more than being with my son.

 in Germany. 

Recording: (1030/ 2140) 
 Oh, definitely. 

Recording: (1031/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm, I did. 

Recording: (1032/ 2140) 
 One of the bathrooms right now is a jacuzzi. That's not really too hard, but the hardest thing to do is electrical work. I think it's just because it's more intimidating.  you 

Recording: (1033/ 2140) 
 You know. 

Recording: (1034/ 2140) 
 No, not at all. I think in the United States, it's the driving force of our government.  a  necessarily a bad thing. When the unions were really strong, I thought, I was reading about it, I thought that was a good thing as well because 

Recording: (1035/ 2140) 
 Oh, yeah. 

Recording: (1036/ 2140) 
 And Teresa, the founder, also realizes that if you can break that cycle through the children, so the focus and the emphasis was really on the children. 

Recording: (1037/ 2140) 
 Absolutely.

 He dropped out and that's where I come into play. I want to be the one that has that high school.  of us should have a high school diploma. He says he's going to probably go back and get his GED but it's like when, when do you have the time hun? You know, you work  so much. It's like, when can I get back to school? 

Recording: (1039/ 2140) 
 I'm trying not to laugh out loud.  Way back and what was it 1670 or something  Colonials 

Recording: (1040/ 2140) 
 right in there. 

Recording: (1041/ 2140) 
 He's got his first name too. 

Recording: (1042/ 2140) 
 I had that with the parakeet I had before. Their lifespan in the wild is about five years, seven years in captivity, and he was 13. 

Recording: (1043/ 2140) 
 I was born in Dayton, Ohio. I lived there almost 35 years before moving to Columbus in 1981.  I lived in northwest Columbus for 18 years. I moved last January a little farther west, about five miles further west near Hilliard, but still live in the city of  Columbus. I've been here about 18, 19 years. I like Columbus also. I think it's a great city, although the last three months I've threatened to move on more than one 

Recording: (1044/ 2140) 
 I've got plenty of people. It's funny Jason's mom asked me, so is your mom gonna come and stay with you for a week? I said no. I told my mom she started last  Because, I mean, of course, for her to come over and help out is terrific, but if she actually stayed at my house for a week, I think we'd just kill each other. 

Recording: (1045/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1046/ 2140) 
 Yeah, and I can say there are some drugs that I don't really consider to be too threatening or that I'm really  to  do the same thing it does. 

Recording: (1047/ 2140) 
 I don't know. I don't know. I'm sure it would happen because there's all kinds of wacky people out there.  Seriously, I don't know. I have family members that are homosexual. That's just my own personal thing, beliefs. I don't know.  I think that's, they shouldn't have taken it off of the DMS, whatever it was. I don't know. 

Recording: (1048/ 2140) 
 We don't know who's in the airplane, but there are seaplanes that do come in and out of there.

 A little geography wouldn't hurt. 

Recording: (1050/ 2140) 
 You know, I haven't tried that. I eat tofu a little bit, but not really that much. I probably should.  It's more to soy products and there's so much nutritional value, especially for women.

 Columbus 

Recording: (1052/ 2140) 
 Yeah. Yeah. 

Recording: (1053/ 2140) 
 That's awesome, there's a lot of stuff to do down there. If you like outdoors. I bet. 

Recording: (1054/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1055/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1056/ 2140) 
 Right. 

Recording: (1057/ 2140) 
 Oh, is he? 

Recording: (1058/ 2140) 
 Right, right, right. 

Recording: (1059/ 2140) 
 which isn't fun. And number two, you know, the diseases and things like that. I think that's a good idea to teach just that it's not all fun and peer pressure.  I know I kind of got off track there, but... 

Recording: (1060/ 2140) 
 The population is much different, yes. 

Recording: (1061/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1062/ 2140) 
 Bye. 

Recording: (1063/ 2140) 
 I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.  of an acquaintance of mine that's kind of a headhunter and I've given him the idea that I want to either work for an attorney that's going to make some changes or do  something that way. I've got a lot of administration and manager and things like that background. So I can have fun doing what I know how to do but also 

Recording: (1064/ 2140) 
 Hehe 

Recording: (1065/ 2140) 
 They know more knowledge. I wouldn't say they're more socially mature or more, um,  I mean, there's even sweet little preschool girls that don't say please and thank you. You know, you have to remind them. 

Recording: (1066/ 2140) 
 Aww, that's nice.

 Yeah. 

Recording: (1078/ 2140) 
 I'm really anything like right now I'm just painting and they laugh at me because I went the other day and found some chairs that were that badly and ask if I could  have them cleaned them up and I'm painting those and things like that.

 There you go. 

Recording: (1080/ 2140) 
 Okay, good.

 to get bags of apples and chicken sandwiches and apple juice. But then here comes Cooper's wife and his daughter and like his  I'm thinking, they're putting all his family up in this hotel the night before a game? I don't know, I just thought it was very strange that he would have his whole family staying there with him when  none of those boys get to bring anybody, you know what I mean? 

Recording: (1233/ 2140) 
 There's a huge wind tunnel, yeah. 

Recording: (1234/ 2140) 
 I have a very general opposition to this kind of thing no matter where it is anymore. My being 76 years of age has a major  you're bearing because I see the total destruction of our center cities. And I say when I speak of center cities, I don't necessarily mean just cities  the size of Columbus which is the largest one in the state of Ohio now, but I'm talking places like Washington Courthouse which maybe have 15,000 or 

Recording: (1235/ 2140) 
 Yes, I did. 

Recording: (1236/ 2140) 
 Mm. 

Recording: (1237/ 2140) 
 The government's always good for money. 

Recording: (1238/ 2140) 
 It's kind of like a... 

Recording: (1239/ 2140) 
 I still think I'll baptize in my fires. But I guess you survived okay because you're here. You're still teaching. 

Recording: (1240/ 2140) 
 Yeah, like a little kid. And he didn't say anything to me, but he made my aunt feel like a little pile of dirt.  sister. And so he just really showed out that day. But what's so funny is our baby, my dad  has red hair and our baby has red hair. 

Recording: (1241/ 2140) 
 Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (1242/ 2140) 
 Our janitor is worthless. Basically, we were complaining about it earlier during the year. Three formal complaints have been filed against him and he still refuses to pay.  is to change the bleach water like more than once a week. It's just really disgusting. So we had these temps come in one day and it was we went in like we're in shock  It was so clean. 

Recording: (1243/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's an old eye sore that they should have got rid of years ago. 

Recording: (1244/ 2140) 
 Right. 

Recording: (1245/ 2140) 
 One thing I was thinking that I have a perspective on that maybe lots of people don't is how Columbus is  grown up. 

Recording: (1246/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1247/ 2140) 
 And I don't know if it's quite that bad, but it was certainly some things that he's been doing that aren't proved up, and I'm not real up on that. 

Recording: (1248/ 2140) 
 I'm living over on IUCAA. If you, on the other side of High Street, you know the McDonald's right by High Street? It's like 

Recording: (1249/ 2140) 
 I think that's too young to talk about birth control methods and everything, but with AIDS and as rampant as it is now, and there's so many more women that have it, start off it was mostly men.  Women have got to know at an early age about these different diseases and things. 

Recording: (1250/ 2140) 
 Right. It's bad. It's bad. On the other hand, it's not good to let your mind wander off somewhere. I find myself having to focus sometimes.  I mean, to really... 

Recording: (1251/ 2140) 
 I like management here. 

Recording: (1252/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1253/ 2140) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (1254/ 2140) 
 The Reds more so than Indians back my younger days because they weren't worth a damn but 

Recording: (1255/ 2140) 
 Oh yeah, I would say so. 

Recording: (1256/ 2140) 
 I was in 78. And then I've just, I have stayed there and it's grown a lot and the work chain  It's an interesting place to work because, well first the job is almost a different job every year because so many changes are happening.  stay out in front of what library innovations, in front of web and net innovations and try to incorporate it all. 

Recording: (1257/ 2140) 
 But one time I read somewhere that a Mexican lady who came across the border to have her baby,  And they put the little band on and they wrote female and then they wrote her last name. She said to her husband when he came over to see her,  Well, they've already named her. Look, FAMALI. 

Recording: (1258/ 2140) 
 And he always said, well, I'm so allergic. But then he didn't have any problems. 

Recording: (1259/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1260/ 2140) 
 Yeah, I hear. 

Recording: (1261/ 2140) 
 But... 

Recording: (1262/ 2140) 
 well, how he felt and knowing that we weren't neglecting him are two different things. We've always emphasized that knowing what's right  or knowing that what's just is one thing is dealing with the emotions is another one. 

Recording: (1263/ 2140) 
 But he just didn't have a very high opinion of the Army. 

Recording: (1264/ 2140) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (1265/ 2140) 
 Yeah, well he thinks he can do it. 

Recording: (1266/ 2140) 
 Wow. 

Recording: (1267/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1268/ 2140) 
 I want I don't want somebody I want them to be able to feel like they can punish him and they can pray and they can 

Recording: (1269/ 2140) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (1270/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1271/ 2140) 
 uh... but i like it when they're new york it's all real loud there's like cars and sirens in the background and stuff or when people uh... and i think that's the  She was telling me about she was getting like some bedroom set or something like that like some sheets or something and she was like asking me if it would go with her wallpaper and stuff and she was like she was like  Describing it to me like alright. This has a green trim with like a flowers design She's like do you think this like blue will accent it or something? I'm like yeah sure whatever like 

Recording: (1272/ 2140) 
 the father, less respect for the mother, less respect for the grandparents and the great-grandparents. I'm going to give you a first-hand example. I just had a  conversation with one of my granddaughters who is now 20. She will come over to my house, Grandpa's house, and  And she'll come in and she'll flop down in a chair. And she will do nothing in that household, even if you suggest it. 

Recording: (1273/ 2140) 
 to be let go. I mean that's an awfully small price to pay for 

Recording: (1274/ 2140) 
 you 

Recording: (1275/ 2140) 
 Like right now their biggest campaign is some elementary school I believe, no I think it's a high school in Marion, was built on an old weapons depot.  and so like leukemia has risen and so like that's their main campaign now is to inform the public and try and get that changed. They've also done other things, other, they do  anything dealing with the environment like exposure, things like that. 

Recording: (1276/ 2140) 
 I don't know how to tell you that. 

Recording: (1277/ 2140) 
 fact that that's the only thing I felt difficult about about living there was they would be asking all these incredible questions and I would be trying to do  the dishes or something mundane like that. It's like, I don't want to do the dishes, I just want to answer the questions. 

Recording: (1278/ 2140) 
 conscientious that there are. 

Recording: (1279/ 2140) 
 Well, somehow or other, yeah. And if everybody would just begin to build that way, and when they start to say something nasty, you would think, would I want them to say that to me? 

Recording: (1280/ 2140) 
 Yeah, it was just like there was a lot of people there who you know like their parents were farmers and or they they were whatever you know it was like  like preppy kids or like hick type kids you know 

Recording: (1281/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1282/ 2140) 
 Everybody needs to know that information. For credit cards. 

Recording: (1283/ 2140) 
 and go back and ask them. As I would ask my English teacher in school, anybody that said, well, what did this poet, what was his,  he wrote this poem and I gave my interpretation. No, no, no, that wasn't it. They'd share their thought. I know that was  He's been dead. 

Recording: (1284/ 2140) 
 feel you can't put a value on a human life. There were just subtle things that my sense of taste and smell  was gone for about a year and a half. Just all the trauma that goes along with it, not just the physical trauma, I mean that was enough to  kill anybody but because of me, because of my size, because of my strength, I wasn't killed.  you 

Recording: (1285/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1286/ 2140) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (1287/ 2140) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (1288/ 2140) 
 Fort Hayes. 

Recording: (1289/ 2140) 
 Ha ha ha ha! 

Recording: (1290/ 2140) 
 How can you do that? 

Recording: (1291/ 2140) 
 The pizza's really cheap. 

Recording: (1292/ 2140) 
 connecting. Some wires are crossed up here or something. And so they become very distrustful of adults because all their life people have been saying, 

Recording: (1293/ 2140) 
 Yeah, well, the white man would probably win, but the black man also has a better chance than the woman, I think. 

Recording: (1294/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

Recording: (1295/ 2140) 
 Yeah, so... 

Recording: (1296/ 2140) 
 have 

Recording: (1297/ 2140) 
 Like a girlfriend's mind. 

Recording: (1298/ 2140) 
 I don't know, I like the story. 

Recording: (1299/ 2140) 
 It was Columbus. He went to Fort Hayes. 

Recording: (1300/ 2140) 
 Oh yeah! 

Recording: (1301/ 2140) 
 getting electrocuted or something yeah that just doesn't appeal to me too much but I mean it's really not too difficult I mean as long as you're careful and 

Recording: (1302/ 2140) 
 Yeah, it says. 

Recording: (1303/ 2140) 
 well, like a million miles down to the South End or something like that. But you just punch in your numbers always. You just talk with numbers.  It's interesting to add on. 

Recording: (1304/ 2140) 
 So I'm like. 

Recording: (1305/ 2140) 
 and you saw very impoverished areas. 

Recording: (1306/ 2140) 
 I play with computers. Normally when people ask me I tell them what I did that day or what I did the day before if they ask me in the evening.  So, what did I do today? Internet Information Server is a product by Microsoft. It lets you house web pages and put them out on the web.  on the web. IndexServe is another product that lets you put search engines on that. Then there's another product by a company called SplitCycle. It's called NetStock. It sucks. NetStock 

Recording: (1307/ 2140) 
 I know, well to me, the cholesterol level and the health from that food has got to be so bad. I mean, my only downfall is I love Taco Bell. So when I'm like working out in the yard.  and mowing and edging and trimming and wash the car and I'd look at my watch and I'd go, oh hell, I deserve a break, I'm going out to lunch. Well, most people would go somewhere really expensive, I'd go, what?  I want a Mexican pizza and a Coke. 

Recording: (1308/ 2140) 
 Well... 

Recording: (1309/ 2140) 
 I can't even go out and sign that long. I've had melanoma, cancer and stuff. So I sold my boat. Now mainly my hobby is just tinkering around stuff.  buy a car, fix it up and sell it. 

Recording: (1310/ 2140) 
 Have you ever been there? 

Recording: (1311/ 2140) 
 Okay, so you're higher up there than I would be. 

Recording: (1312/ 2140) 
 Obviously it's not something new that's been coming around. I mean, it's been around for a long time. 

Recording: (1313/ 2140) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (1314/ 2140) 
 Yeah, that's it. 

Recording: (1315/ 2140) 
 I helped them set up different things, helped them clean them up afterwards, prep patients, all kinds of different things. That was a lot of blood and stuff.  I don't know. When it's not you, it seems a little easier to observe, I guess. When you see somebody you know, it's a little more concerning to you.  I don't know. But you see a lot of different stuff. And you hope that the majority of it's helping this person out. Now my wife, you know, 

Recording: (1316/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1317/ 2140) 
 And so they went up there, but the Germans caught on pretty quick and they made it pretty hot. And that area of Enzio was just flat as this rock.  stable almost for an area back from the Mediterranean, back probably ten miles, ten or twelve miles  Well, along the coast, along. And so we had enough area to many people. 

Recording: (1318/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1319/ 2140) 
 you  her move in with them. They were her temporary foster parents. And she just turned 16, so she was 15 when she moved in with them. She refused to  used to change and I don't know what could have changed it if they would have got her out earlier but basically all three of them 

Recording: (1320/ 2140) 
 I travel across the state and country and before that I was always traveling.  to fall semester, back time of semester, not quarters. And we'd get on a Greyhound bus, 15 hour pass, and Buddy and I would just travel all over the country and sleep in  the bus at night. 

Recording: (1321/ 2140) 
 Yeah, it is. I like it. 

Recording: (1322/ 2140) 
 You know, so. 

Recording: (1323/ 2140) 
 See ya. 

Recording: (1324/ 2140) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (1325/ 2140) 
 It's different. 

Recording: (1326/ 2140) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (1327/ 2140) 
 Oh hell yeah, look at you man. 

Recording: (1328/ 2140) 
 We're excited. It'll be fun. 

Recording: (1329/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1330/ 2140) 
 Right. 

Recording: (1331/ 2140) 
 Right. I think teaching band might be fun because I think you only ever got a satisfactory or unsatisfactory in band and it had mostly to do with whether you were there.  Whether you were well behaved, yeah, and whether you're trying to play your instrument. I don't think we ever got A's, B's, and C's.  Yeah. 

Recording: (1332/ 2140) 
 I have no problem with a man being with a man or a woman being with a woman, but if that was the relationship for everybody, 

Recording: (1333/ 2140) 
 I feel like I have friends and when we say, oh, we're going out to the bar, like we all know which bar because there's only one that college students go to. 

Recording: (1334/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1335/ 2140) 
 You're gonna get a lot of dates. 

Recording: (1336/ 2140) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (1337/ 2140) 
 Yeah, there's a girl at the store I was talking to and she saw how I wrote my signature. If you look right there,  She asked if I was a doctor. 

Recording: (1338/ 2140) 
 Yeah, yeah, I don't know. But then they second guess the mother and she risked her life. They can't do that. I mean, you know, it's too bad that  that she wasn't there to go on with what they were planning on doing, but it's not our right to take other countries' kids even. I mean, that's another thing.  come to America we'll take everyone and everything. But then we have all this crime because we have all these terrorist people that come from, I mean that's all they've grown up with. 

Recording: (1339/ 2140) 
 In high school, yeah, I was friends with most of them. 

Recording: (1340/ 2140) 
 We are. 

Recording: (1341/ 2140) 
 Did you get a tape of everything? I don't care if it's overtime or not as long as...

 um... at the same time and at the same time uh... that my mother my dad split up i was  just about to start my second year at Worthington High School. So I'm about to start my sophomore year and for the first time in something like three years I'm at the school. For two years  in a row. And so I was like, no, I just finally made friends. There's no way in hell I'm leaving the friends I just finally succeeded in making. My father-in-law

 Mm-hmm.

 Mhm. Right. 

Recording: (1349/ 2140) 
 You've spelled every name, you've read every name, you've written every name. Practically, there aren't any that you haven't heard of. 

Recording: (1350/ 2140) 
 Walk us all the way through the hospital. 

Recording: (1351/ 2140) 
 just just kind of instincts I guess.  Yeah, actually there are quite a, there's a well, pretty well-known doctor that has a ton of books and I go to La Leche League and  That's kind of their philosophy in a way. Yeah. Just that breastfeeding is, you know, a way to mother and

 Williams freshman year and every single one of them was accurate. It was really really really funny. William will lose something expensive by the end of the year and I had my bike  stolen. William will either grow in his faith significantly or will go  exact opposite direction. I knew one way or another what happened because my roommate my freshman year for the first quarter was a drug dealer.  Oh 

Recording: (1357/ 2140) 
 Well, I agree that we should help them, maybe through some sort of government program. But I think what really hurts them the most is the people that actually give them the money on  on  with it because it's really easy life. 

Recording: (1358/ 2140) 
 you 

Recording: (1359/ 2140) 
 Not on airplanes, but on heating and cooling systems.

 It's a lot of the, it looks, look and feel is a lot the same. 

Recording: (1361/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1362/ 2140) 
 And then how satisfying is that to them? When you have a chance to talk to them? That's where we need to learn more from, interview, have more meaningful interviews with these people.  that we can learn from them. They put them in the spotlight, but we somehow, we just don't want to, I guess, flood them with the...  We don't want to get the negative answer because it might hurt the image of the university. Oh, gee, no. Who was it? Katzenmaier or something? 

Recording: (1363/ 2140) 
 And they're very into capitalism and their lives are working pretty good for them. 

Recording: (1364/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah, because they think they're grown. They think they're grown and they're like 12 and 13 and they've been having sex since they were 10.  It's just like, and yeah, and they're having babies earlier and earlier and it's just really scary.

 Anything else is a hardware failure and you'd have to go fix it somewhere else anyway. So if you know how to put an operating system on your machine, you can start over. If you can start over, there's no reason to be scared of anything that you do.  Problem number one in playing with computers for most people is being afraid that they're going to break something. 

Recording: (1366/ 2140) 
 I'm trying to come up with like a  narrative that's both fun and brief. Okay, so my friend Chris and I are upstairs playing on the computer and my sister's downstairs watching television. It's  Sunday morning and I am trying to figure out how this game works, trying to figure out how this game works, and then I said, I've got some information on this game out in the car, I'm gonna go get it.

 You know, there's things about my dad that I wouldn't want to live with. He's great and he's wonderful to me. I mean, my dad is really wonderful to me.  But I mean things like when my mom had me, he didn't pick her up from the hospital. I mean it's that kind of stuff that you think, what the hell were you thinking? 

Recording: (1369/ 2140) 
 such an idea and that indeed is going to take away from family. In my way of thinking, I can't imagine  that I would have my wife producing somebody else's child over here and I'm going to have the  same thank you that's exactly fatherly love fatherly value fatherly instincts toward war

 Ha ha ha ha.

 Exactly. Huge.

 Hmm.

 Mm-hmm.

 I'm still in it.

 Oh my god.

 And we'd adjust the guns, call down shifts, so they could come within reasonable, close to that.

 and a Tencent store, theater, I forget, a couple other shops. And when Orrin was  About, I don't know, five or maybe six or seven years old, he had been explicitly told that he was not to go up there.  at all. So one day, Grandma gave him, I don't know, a quarter.

 So.

 The problem is, like say, every airline wants to go to New York City and they want all their businessmen there at 8 a.m. Well, an airport has  So many runways and so many taxiways, and like say, ten airplanes every ten minutes can come in and out of those airports.  they end up shooting like 30 there. So instead of letting them all get in the air and stand up there and hold while they're shooting them in, what they do is they'll

 All of them, the university is divided up in different areas and there's a shop within each area that takes care of all the maintenance needs for those areas.  about 20 buildings or so.

Recording: (1381/ 2140) 
 Oh yeah, there's always people out there. 

Recording: (1382/ 2140) 
 I took a class for word processing 1 and 2. I took those.  I tell you truth. I can't remember if they taught me how to balance a checkbook out 

Recording: (1383/ 2140) 
 Yeah, I thought in the beginning I missed mirror Lake cafe so bad said the good subs and all that I don't I don't know why I missed them. I don't  I go back and now I just don't like it anymore. 

Recording: (1384/ 2140) 
 It's a pretty dangerous drug I would say for the most part. Not so much the getting high part of it, but just what goes into it. 

Recording: (1385/ 2140) 
 I'm not.

 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1392/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1393/ 2140) 
 Yeah, exactly. So, you know, once you get to a certain degree of frustration,  and you need to relieve that somehow. So that's pretty much why we moved. 

Recording: (1394/ 2140) 
 Really? 

Recording: (1395/ 2140) 
 from our friends that have gone, their discipline is expelling the child from school. Well, they're expelling them to a home where the parents were  where they're just getting three days of free play. I mean, pretty much to get in trouble and cause more trouble. They really aren't learning from that. 

Recording: (1396/ 2140) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (1397/ 2140) 
 Well, yeah, I think it's real important to really get a good feel for how you are and all your beliefs and all that. They have to really match.  And if they don't, then it's not ever going to work because there's always going to be conflict and friction and all that kind of thing. So I think it's real important.  and there's no age limit on that to when you really feel good about yourself and you really know what you want to do then that's the only time that you can really commit and say yeah we

 I never knew they had so many beaches. I mean, I know they had a good reputation, you know, for like just having a great vacation time. Because nobody ever came back from Australia and said,  The place was terrible, the weather was bad, people were rude. Everybody said, you've got to go, you've got to go. It's a long flight, but it's well worth the time.  the city of Sioux Falls. We're

 Well, that's probably the roof right there. 

Recording: (1403/ 2140) 
 Yeah.

 She's very bright. She comes from an extremely dysfunctional family. Her parents divorced when she was about four. Her mother's an alcoholic. Her father said he would take her.  with him and then after he got divorced he changed his mind so she's pretty much raised herself. It's a big, it's terrible things what she's had to go through and  And she's made it very clear that she will not live with an alcoholic. And that's helped straighten him out some. And our feeling was never that the alcoholism or 

Recording: (1405/ 2140) 
 So I think 

Recording: (1406/ 2140) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (1407/ 2140) 
 I think that basically that's in a nutshell they've reached a point in their life where, you know, they're cowards as far as going out and killing themselves, but they want to kill themselves slowly by drinking.  themselves a death or smoking you know whatever you know smoking crack or whatever and then you  and just living in a hell, I mean.

 and you need to have the violence and stuff like that. I have never heard, and you know, I'm just using pot right now. 

Recording: (1412/ 2140) 
 much more widely used once you get into college. But I mean as far as like the pot and just things like that I mean I can't say I see any difference between

 It has a large gate. It does. 

Recording: (1414/ 2140) 
 of  to be able to do anything else any guy can do.

 Because now they're getting to the age where they're fighting more and you got a boy and a girl. 

Recording: (1424/ 2140) 
 Right. 

Recording: (1425/ 2140) 
 But then it's like some evil person back there in the screening room puts some of this junk in there right in the middle and then you go, you can't stop and not watch that, you know.  And if I was in charge of it, I'd cut some of it out. It's not that important. 

Recording: (1426/ 2140) 
 It wasn't so much of a hate thing, it was just more, these are the people I like to hang out with. If you don't like that, that's fine. 

Recording: (1427/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1428/ 2140) 
 I think that just because you do so, because I know I've done studies and I took some of those classes, and you just think about it that way. I think a lot of these people just say,  The nurse said you take everything for a fact, and I thought that was kind of strange. But I think there are a lot of things that are probably positive enough about it that I would want to do it for a while.  as long as I could.

 I said, this will never work. I'm not interested. Take it back. And he said, no, no, no. Just let's just work with us. Just work with us. We'll take care of this. So I end up selling to him for 144.  But it was just funny because I thought I thought they're never gonna get to where I have to be and we're not even gonna play this game back and forth 

Recording: (1431/ 2140)

 You got bears?

 Yep. 

Recording: (1434/ 2140) 
 Yeah, I applied for it and went after it aggressively. 

Recording: (1435/ 2140) 
 And I'm not quite sure how to address that. Because some people would say, now wait a minute, you're talking out of both sides of your mouth, the expression is. How can you say,  over here you must have the love of this child in your arms and then over here you're saying you believe in capital punishment and electrocution.

 I had hypertension when I had the first two and then the last two I had, now I got cardiovascular disease. I still got one of my arteries about 80% blocked. I got  another one 50% block and I got a dead spot on my heart right now. So when I exercise, my heart slows down. Let's put it this way where I work at. I work here at OSU.  you

 like one of my friends who had the apartment in Arlington. 

Recording: (1439/ 2140) 
 About 15 minutes. My mom and I don't go too far from each other. But Jason's going to take the week off and everything, so I think that we'll be able to do that. 

Recording: (1440/ 2140) 
 Yeah, and because I, back when I was in high school in my AP government class, I was paying attention a lot, you know, like I read the Columbus Dispatch every day and I read  US News and World Report for my economics class and I was totally caught up with everything. 

Recording: (1441/ 2140) 
 Oh yeah, and I'll probably step on your toes here, but I'm not a firm believer of mom and dad both working. My wife worked until we had children, then she stayed home, and once they got  into school, she worked at a school. So when they were gone, she was gone. When they were home, she was home. And my parents didn't do that, and I hated it. I hated coming home from school by myself every day.  day. There was nobody there to talk to, you know, and I did it for years. And I just feel that, you know, I hope you don't have children yet. Do you?

And I think that's going to happen again because the candidates, and I'm telling you my politics here very clearly and early, but the candidates have pretty well spoken on  that issue already. I know which one will protect the right for choice and I think

 right there's a lot of money in town here and there's sometimes like you'll see a one entire airplane that goes to Cancun and it's like people are going on  vacation or people are going to go gambling in Jamaica that's all it is so then when that comes in we have these really weird painted airplanes and we're like who is that

 She said it's amazing you can give people numbers and they immediately use them wrong. They just don't know how to use them.  they completely misinterpret even though it's very clearly stated what they're doing. And the newspapers do that a lot too.

 One of my best friends from high school and my boyfriend are both in it and they had bugged me about it forever to come and like I don't know about computers  So they took me finally like December or something.

 I'm working on three different research projects with three different physicians. Two are specific to the traumatic brain injury service, looking at long-term outcomes in people  that have sustained traumatic brain injuries. The other one is a drug study looking at control of agitation. And the other one is a spinal cord injury research study. 

Recording: (1456/ 2140) 
 I feel like I should be standing out there giving money because my bills are getting high.

 Yeah, it's a lot smaller than Columbus though 

Recording: (1458/ 2140) 
 His speed was like, say, 70 miles an hour before, and now it's going to be 20 because he doesn't know how to do it. And that's the problem they're running into. They have all these qualified people who know how to separate airplanes.  and how to get them in trail and you know everything but now they've got to do this extra part which is going to make their job easier down the road but everybody hates change.  So what they're doing now is they're having problems because people can't take the volume of airplanes because they're trying to keep up with the computer, so it's making it even slower.

 You were past ready. Yeah. 

Recording: (1464/ 2140) 
 No, I don't think it was because I grew up just basic, not even really Christian, just really no real religion.  and I'd been going to Presbyterian Church as I was about 19 years old, looking for something, a church. I just had a feeling that I wanted to have that experience.  that in my life because I never had that before. And so I was just looking around and I was open to anything. I'd listen to

 Well, they pretty much put by the test scores, they don't sit you down like in private schools they do this. They sit you down one to one, just like we are.  They spend probably, you know, maybe 20-30 minutes a day actually getting to know the student, what the student still needs for the completion  of that grade and once they figure that you're able to go there, then up you go, right up the ladder. 

Recording: (1468/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1469/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1470/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1471/ 2140) 
 Right, at the age that they were. 

Recording: (1472/ 2140) 
 I'm bouncing around too much. 

Recording: (1473/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1474/ 2140) 
 Yeah, you know, I've just come to, I always prefer for my children and myself, I mean, if there's anything  Disney, I usually go and watch it at the movie theater. And after a while, I think Beauty and the Beast is where it really came through to me. It's like, that's  wonderful story but do they have to have all that killing and so on in the middle right in the middle of it. 

Recording: (1475/ 2140) 
 And then as the community fanned out, then they had bigger houses. I like living in the old area better. I like the houses in the new areas better.  There's one in particular that's just gorgeous.

 So let's say she was in a situation where she had some sort of bills to pay, you know, the one environment was much more close-knit.  I'm sure somewhere, I'm sure somewhere.  somewhere along the line, they would work things out to try to help her over those bumps. It wouldn't be long term. And they would know that it would not be long term. But that's that 

Recording: (1485/ 2140) 
 She goes, well yeah, Dad, they cost money. I said, oh, Lord. 

Recording: (1486/ 2140) 
 Yeah, that's really a tough one because I think people are looking for easy answers and there is no easy answer.  I don't think it's violence on TV. I don't think it's working parents. I think it's, I don't know what it is. It seems to be something more pervasive than could be solved.  easily. I don't know it's a tough one. I mean your daughter, his

 He thought it was great that I was going to school, but...

 Yeah, imagine you learned it in a hurry. 

Recording: (1505/ 2140) 
 You know. 

Recording: (1506/ 2140) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (1507/ 2140) 
 And

 I mean, it's a lot better than it was even a year ago. 

Recording: (1509/ 2140) 
 Well, no, actually my mom didn't. She was a very bad cook.

 The majority of the ones that don't get the guidance at home that you're trying to reach ain't gonna go to Boy Scouts.

 Right, yeah. 

Recording: (1513/ 2140) 
 Try it if you have eight children. And if you're here in this country and you have eight children, why do you have eight children to start with? 

Recording: (1514/ 2140) 
 Yeah, and the problem is seeing things in other people. I mean actually seeing spirits.  in other people in terms of someone said the eyes are the mirror to the soul that's very true you know I could see in  in certain people's eyes when I was in the hospital, the confusion, the unsure feelings 

Recording: (1515/ 2140) 
 Doesn't that get back more or less to the thing about everybody being me, me, me now and therefore they really don't so much care about where they came from and what they are and who they are? 

Recording: (1516/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1517/ 2140) 
 Right. 

Recording: (1518/ 2140) 
 Really? 

Recording: (1519/ 2140) 
 and yes, it's a Catholic school environment. So it'll be interesting to see what evolves from the children's attention to.  the Roman Catholic side of religion as compared to the Baptists. 

Recording: (1520/ 2140) 
 right and then they wonder why you know I don't know what's happened it's the other person who's changed you know and if you if you start changing your behavior you  can usually get the kinds of changes. I always figure if you treat people the way that old golden rule thing, if you give out what you want back, you get it. 

Recording: (1521/ 2140) 
 Or like I talked to this one guy he was he was a Navy SEAL and he did like a couple tours in Vietnam And he was he was talking about how he was he was drunk, and he was he was from Alabama  He was like, yeah, I'm about half drunk now, so I'm trying to figure out where his model number is. And like, I don't know, we talked to him for like 15 minutes. 

Recording: (1522/ 2140) 
 I think that's great. I think obviously there's always a downside, but  I think that too many people abuse the system and you know unfortunately it's very  very 

Recording: (1523/ 2140) 
 like it's okay i mean it's like a country school which was always over to as i was like me and my friends are always like the way they sever along here and so that was like they speak of the kipi rd  And like that was I guess weird kind of like being the odd people in an  in a small Midwestern farming school is kind of odd, I guess. I don't know.

Recording: (1526/ 2140) 
 People like that can't work. When I was a kid, your family took care of you. There wasn't welfare and stuff like this. But you don't have a family structure no more.

 When you think that our major resource is our children and our offspring, then we better not, you know.

 cents an hour at the Beverly across the street on Neal Avenue. So but anyhow you know they could never understand you know you didn't you never got a job with it you know why  Why would you go to school and waste all that money? It was the best money I ever spent. 

Recording: (1529/ 2140) 
 Yeah, we was going up there to... I can't really remember. You know, it's been 20 years ago. And I just...  You know, I don't have any real recollection. 

Recording: (1530/ 2140) 
 Nope. 

Recording: (1531/ 2140) 
 And if I was in the same situation, I'd be doing the same thing. 

Recording: (1532/ 2140) 
 Wow, yeah, I know. 

Recording: (1533/ 2140) 
 Appeals, appeals. 

Recording: (1534/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1535/ 2140) 
 whole time, I was in high school and college and all this kind of thing, but it was just like, people just thought, oh, you are American, you're here, therefore you must have lots of extra money to throw around.  and they just sort of don't grasp the fact that you can have made sacrifices to be there.  Also in films, you know, I remember actually being in Bristol in that film California with Brad Pitt and Julie Lewis and you know, they're in the trailer and everything else 

Recording: (1536/ 2140) 
 We now run under Gregorian and that sort of thing. But back to your question, I think you were asking, 

Recording: (1537/ 2140) 
 Yeah, I'm actually like a month older than him. 

Recording: (1538/ 2140) 
 but he'd bring in a nutritionalist or whatever to explain to the parents blah blah blah 

Recording: (1539/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1540/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1541/ 2140) 
 Yes you are! You're saying you don't need to have a leader in a family. And if I'm going to be a leader, I'm going to be the one. I'm going to be the one, not the sperm bank. Oh, you came from this little tube here. Oh, okay.  That's the principle of family. No, I have to be because there's no father here.

 the technical assistance and policy end of it and hated it. The other years were fine, but those last three  They were pretty bad.

 Oh my gosh. It's one of them, like, you know, falling out of trees. 

Recording: (1545/ 2140) 
 I talk to him every now and then. 

Recording: (1546/ 2140) 
 So, I mean, carrying cabinets and he'll do it. As long as you're paying him, he'll do it. 

Recording: (1547/ 2140) 
 I'm not built that way. 

Recording: (1548/ 2140) 
 Well, I do think access is too easy, but it's sort of like anything else. I think if laws were passed, the people who were against it would be so, you know, just  themselves that it would I don't know for how long but I think it would make the situation not with the shootings and things like that but I think  it would make the gun situation probably much worse for a while because people would be doing illegal things to get guns. 

Recording: (1549/ 2140) 
 Just throw that into being sure you're relaxed enough. 

Recording: (1550/ 2140) 
 but I don't see it as negatively affecting me. I still get all the stuff done I need to get done. 

Recording: (1551/ 2140) 
 2 in the 11th and 2 in the 12th. You can take them as many times as you need to take them, but if you don't pass them all by the time you graduate, you get this nifty little thing called an attendance certificate.  It's not a real diploma. It's like, okay, I attended. I didn't learn anything, but I was there.

And at some point,  that we're going to have to put a levy on again. And who knows what's happened. We're keeping Rosa Smith right now.  because she's so good PR with the business community, but the business community in Columbus doesn't really support the schools.

Recording: (1712/ 2140) 
 Oh no, no they move you around all the time when you teach kids with learning disabilities. They move you to where the population is rather than move the  kids to you. So yeah, I've been in Columbus and Worthington are the two systems I've been in, but you know that within those systems they can move you around from school to school.  I'm in at the same one now for, this is my seventh year at the middle school.

 Yeah! 

Recording: (1717/ 2140) 
 Yeah, and I had the prerogative. I could have gone somewhere else and made more money. But the bad part was, as the university's trying to do away with  Civil service is a good thing and a bad thing. You know, you do, you had step raises and everything, so at least you did have an increase back then. Nowadays, you have none.  nothing. 

Recording: (1718/ 2140) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1719/ 2140) 
 Yeah, well people don't have the priorities that they should. What do you do? You work all your life and you make a lot of money and then you die. What did you do  Did you learn anything? Did you teach anyone? Did you have an opinion about anything? That to me, if you don't have time, then you're just floating along.  I'm trying to take it up space now. 

Recording: (1720/ 2140) 
 Yeah.

 Yeah, yeah. They said.  it's going to be hard to do in some of the other states, but I don't think so.

 Um, yes and no. I mean, as far as the experience goes, I mean, I don't live on campus, so  I don't get the entire college experience, you know, the whole dorms and events going place on campus. It's more things that I pick and choose that I want to do.  do on campus I come down for. So I can't really say it's anything too drastic. I mean obviously it's kind of weird when people are asking what you're doing and you're

Recording: (1739/ 2140) 
 I mean, fact of the matter is, if being gay is a genetic disorder, then that should have no effect on  the kids because they should still be normal I guess or whatever you want to say. 

Recording: (1740/ 2140) 
 Not as much as I used to be when I was younger. I used to be diehard, but not anymore.  Yeah, by their standards, but they still were 66, you know, and they probably could have won maybe a  couple more games but that's about it.

 Well, I often have to write on papers. I believe you turned in the wrong paper. I believe I got the rough draft instead of the final copy. Do you have the final copy somewhere at home?  and

 Yeah, just since March. 

Recording: (1748/ 2140) 
 and feeder and I go, don't bother me. I've had a bad day and I'm tired. You go watch TV. And how are we raising children doing that? You know, you know, and people say you have to have  both those incomes because we have to do this. Why do you have to have a house that's $300,000? Why do you have to have a brand new car? Isn't life sacrifices?  Aren't you supposed to do best for your children? My children don't have everything. They don't have a Sega. My daughter has a car that goes to

 Almost all the parents did.

 Mhm. 

Recording: (1752/ 2140) 
 Mm. 

Recording: (1753/ 2140) 
 where they're almost segregating themselves by having these organizations because they're geared specifically towards black people. And I think in a way that's  some  30, 40 years ago, where they had their white organizations or whatnot. And I think it's sort of going along the same lines. 

Recording: (1754/ 2140) 
 That would be neat, that would be real neat. But that's Dreamworld, so. 

Recording: (1755/ 2140) 
 You can't, especially with kids, it's just too overwhelming. 

Recording: (1756/ 2140) 
 Yeah. Yeah. 

Recording: (1757/ 2140) 
 I don't know. Maybe if teachers, just their status in society isn't real high when it should be, it's more...  like garbage men get paid more than teachers, you know, and how, but it, so it's just like people always talk about, you know, education for the, you know, we got to like,  think about our child's future or whatever, but really teachers are paid crap and don't really get a lot of respect from anybody. Like professors and stuff get 

Recording: (1758/ 2140) 
 Yeah, if they want, if they, you know, choose. I'm sure there's, you know, women that are lesbians that have been with men also, you know, they've been with a man and  then they've been with a woman now. Now they got a girlfriend. So obviously, you know, and I feel like that was because they had an attraction towards a woman, so now they think they're lesbian.  I don't see, I don't, that's why I think, so I don't think that, but if that's their choice, that's their choice. So I do think they could change.  Bye. 

Recording: (1759/ 2140) 
 I would say it doesn't really matter either way honestly. I mean the fact of the matter is they are so deal with it.  Get over it, I mean. 

Recording: (1760/ 2140) 
 I think, I think through education that's, it's just going to only help. 

Recording: (1761/ 2140) 
 Right. 

Recording: (1762/ 2140) 
 It's American from the fact that it was written by Native Americans.  And Joseph Smith was an American and he was used to translate it. It's actually funny though.  There's more members of the church that live outside of America.

 Hehe 

Recording: (1764/ 2140) 
 I'm trying to think, it's a Meijer brand, I know that's what we have. It's like Frutos instead of... 

Recording: (1765/ 2140) 
 And the fact that I recognized all that and couldn't wait to get out of there and when I was gone, I was gone. And even now we still have this ongoing thing where my family, in fact,  I've been really happy about them lately because we've lived in our same house for 20 years and my parents, they live in Florida.  I mean, they're not well-to-do by any means, but they're not lacking for anything, and they can afford to take plane trips, and they can afford to go to California twice a year to study. 

Recording: (1766/ 2140)

 For the medical insurance. 

Recording: (1774/ 2140) 
 You really need to start teaching what I call the older values, but good values, I don't care whether they're old or new.  But good values, and I think we really need to have that established within our educational system. Starting in the elementary, right on up through college.  I think there ought to be a number of courses that devoted exclusively for this so that those students can 

Recording: (1775/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1776/ 2140) 
 So really that's about it. I have a dog who's outside right now and that's it for my kids. 

Recording: (1777/ 2140) 
 basic where they learn things is their peers they don't get everything instilled at home that's pretty much what you  know, I seen talking to my husband and, you know, and there's so many broken homes and single moms and trying to trying to do  at all and the kids are the ones that are suffering and having to grow up before they're ready. 

Recording: (1778/ 2140) 
 Yeah.  No, not at all. No.  I'm pretty shy for the most part so there's more types of questions.

I liked at first having Captain Janeway being a female in the leadership standpoint, but I still think that  the women on the show, particularly Seven of Nine, are used as sex objects. 

Recording: (1782/ 2140) 
 Absolutely. 

Recording: (1783/ 2140) 
 So they spent all these thousands of dollars on airfare and they're still coming out ahead. Maybe they should get to one of those Las Vegas chapel weddings and do like a drive-thru.  They really want to do it on the cheap. I didn't have Elvis as a performance ceremony. That's crazy.

In other words, let's say you have 100 IQ, but in all of your classes, your performance is  like a 70 IQ person would.

All you see is this like orange haze. You can't see stars very well. The noise, I mean there's always noise. I remember last year living in the dorms,  Every morning at 2.30 in the morning, there was a trash truck that picked up some trash from a bar right behind where we lived. I lived in Taylor, so it's

New York, you know, I don't get to New York that often, but, you know, I mean, I can, I still have access to a lot of stuff if I want to go to the trouble.

 Oh, they do in ninth grade, and by 10th grade and 11th, they're a little more focused on the fact that they better get their act together because they're going to have to go to college.  the only life they're gonna get, you know? They kind of get that realization, they start getting serious. Kids at middle school think everything's just a big joke, you know? I'm gonna play in a rock band.  You know, they all think they're going to be rock stars and drummers and, you know, they could care less about anything. It hasn't hit them yet. This is my real life.

Recording: (1900/ 2140) 
 And you know I just really think they need to make that an option for a young girl. I really do because there's just you know there's just too many unwanted  children. There just is, and that really bothers me that we don't have another option like another country. We're a lot more right-wing here in America, but  I just feel that's got to be an option, you know, for these young girls. It just really does. 

Recording: (1901/ 2140)

 Freshman, sophomore year, yes. After that I quit wrestling and I just kind of found myself being myself.  instead of trying to be someone else. Sports is definitely part of a clique. You try  to be part of the team and the team tries to do everything the same.

Recording: (1908/ 2140) 
 And that's essentially what the Supreme Court said in their last decision on this two, three years ago. What they said was whether we think it's right or wrong, whether we think the previous Supreme Court was right or wrong, it's been a  part of this fabric of this country for more than 10 years and to reverse it would create too much, too many problems for people.  which I thought was a nice way of saying, sorry folks, but it's too late. 

Recording: (1909/ 2140) 
 That's exactly what it is. 

Recording: (1910/ 2140) 
 I think that there should be a mandatory, because you have it in big companies, you have mandatory sexual harassment tapes.  And you learn, you teach the girls that it's not what they do, it's how they make you feel is constituted as your harassment there.  and they're too afraid. And then besides that, there's crushes. You can't fault the girls for having crushes and things like that. They're going through enough things as it is.

 Well, the first thing is Clintonville. 

Recording: (1914/ 2140) 
 I'd like to see that implemented, something like that in the United States. That'd be a neat thing. Because I know iron foundries and the low  lower paying jobs. They hire people that are illiterate and things like that and they can't give paychecks out on Thursdays because everyone will call off on Fridays because they all go out and get drunk.  I don't know what they do with their paychecks. I know that's a big, big problem.

 The bad places, the television things that they have on, the programs they have on, and I think that that's had a lot to do with changing our younger generation in the way they think, the way they act, what their morals are.  And I think that's why they're having more shootings in schools. And the programs are terrible. I think that they need to really redo them. There's too much profanity.  there's too much sex, there's too much just do what I want. I got to do my own thing. That's what when the I want to do my own thing started he says with the women's feminist movement.  But...

 but the federal government and their lawyers have done that and the Department of the Interior still considers Native Americans on the same level as a dog. They don't have  rights. There's something wrong there. And that still goes on today after about 600 years. And we got good people in this country that want to do something about it.  But unfortunately, you know, what I'm finding, you got, everybody's got to choose their path. 

Recording: (1933/ 2140) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1934/ 2140) 
 Whether they're playing a video game where they're shooting people, I can't see that as being something that affects them.

 We try and teach and expand people's knowledge so that when they go out and they talk to someone about Christ, they don't have to be afraid.  have that blank look on their face when the person asks them something. You know, that somebody asks them something and they're like, you know, I don't know. Or they actually have an answer. You know, if and if  they don't know, they'll say, I don't know, but I can find out for you if you're willing to give me the time to go find out. So what's the hardest question that someone has ever asked you?  감사합니다.

 That was so funny. 

Recording: (1952/ 2140) 
 Namaste. 

Recording: (1953/ 2140) 
 I think the reason that our generation is cynical, the reason I'm cynical, is because we're handed a world in which we see  injustices of the past. The hypocrisy, I mean I guess injustice, also applies in terms of things like the Cold War and stuff. That's why I'm cynical.  I hope that answers your question at least a little bit. I don't know. I feel kind of preachy. Like, this is my position.

 I'm not.

 improvement in three months and all that kind of, it was image and we were saying the same thing, you know, we want to continue this, we want to make even this better.  We learn to say the negatives in a positive way and that's important. You need to appeal to the center.  Americans don't like extreme liberals. They don't like extreme conservatives. They want peace.

 So I almost bought one a couple weeks ago. In fact, I went into contract on it with this guy, this dear old man, it was for his mother who was in her 90s.  I was on Royal Forest, which is north. And I made this low offer, and I never thought that they would. I didn't want, it was kind of like, I felt like I had to do this because I,  If I was going to get this house, I should get it. But I didn't really want now because I have the baby coming and we're going to be busy and I didn't want to get involved in it. And so I made this offer and then he countered back.

 my family and I'll see them face to face and I'll recognize them and they'll recognize me.

Recording: (1983/ 2140) 
 Well, it's got to come from the top.  You know, I just found like there was just a total lack of interest in the student from every direction.  So I would say you know it's an organizational problem.

Recording: (1989/ 2140) 
 Right now he's really interested in Eastern religions. I'm not sure where that came from. You know, when they go to college and they're gone and you don't see them much. That's what he's interested in right now.  So I don't think it really took
