Recording: (19/ 2140) 
but i want them to do that to me and i think if you could teach your kids that and get back to teaching the same thing on those radio programs and tv programs instead of what they are showing right now uh i think the world would be a lot of place the lot better place and along with the politicians they stopped saying now what is really best for the general public i said what we think to make our ourselves look great 

Recording: (20/ 2140) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (21/ 2140) 
um to move forward in my life now what happened with the chill was you know there was uh i had a friend that work for them so they did not know that and um uh he told me that there was glass in the back room that they were supposed to and it was about five or five feet higher three to five feet higher and uh the 

Recording: (22/ 2140)

which i think george w is trying to do uh uh whenever anybody tells me that i go tell them i tell them yes and i am in uh and in different liberal 

Recording: (25/ 2140) 
so i have just the same opinion i think most people have it as as tv 

Recording: (26/ 2140) 
i am an independent 

Recording: (27/ 2140)

umhum 

Recording: (30/ 2140) 
what would you do 

Recording: (31/ 2140) 
i mean well that guy who could change for him that and in the movie they were about to kids i i do not like it when they get that close i i like the how oh their their relationship is still professional and they interact with each other on that level first and they are very good friends and they have that attention but they do not come to it and i really like it i just dislike it a little less 

Recording: (32/ 2140) 
uh and uh her decisions are happening to her without her making them and um i think she needs to have as many facts as she can get her hands on 

Recording: (33/ 2140)

Recording: (34/ 2140) 
um i do not i mean there definitely is that image of you know dallas and dimeses i think it is it is worse i think for the the image of the taurus like basically they think anyone who can afford to be over there must be absolutely loaded you know and that was sort of another thing when you know i went to school there is you know i had a scholarship that is how i went there you know and i worked but 

Recording: (35/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (36/ 2140)

Recording: (38/ 2140) 
he he is like 

Recording: (39/ 2140) 
uh yeah well um i think the teachers are every bit as good as the sticated but i think they it seems to be uh the whole administration all through the board and just just not as a to i do not i do not know how it is great it is like the teachers are sort of it seems like they almost had the feeling they are on their own what 

Recording: (40/ 2140) 
so it was it was neat though because pete was my mom was twenty nine and pete was eighteen and so pete was just like some kid who liked to play you know and like to play and and do all oh they spend stuff and 

Recording: (41/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (42/ 2140)

Recording: (44/ 2140) 
um i would not know that long 

Recording: (45/ 2140)

Recording: (46/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (47/ 2140) 
i mean i i had parents that everything i did was negative i mean they just told me i could not do this could not do that and and so what i try to do is when anything comes up i was thinking of how my parents would handle it and i do a hundred and eighty degrees so you know because you know they just i do not know how i got i sort of feel i am mentally okay now but i do not know how i got here because i have been there right you know and it is the you know 

Recording: (48/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (49/ 2140) 
it was uh part of the time 

Recording: (50/ 2140) 
b big people coming from other cities like chicago new york you know and places like that where they were treated poorly by once you know they um they tended to act differently towards you and everything until they realized that you were not like that you know uh we only had one ratio once and one of us in the service uh or was we were predominately white uh platoon and uh because we worked in this was and stuff you know so 

Recording: (51/ 2140) 
you know my daughter you know there is just a lot of stuff when she was in high school and i would call up to the school and you know the principal was like he he said you know i am at i am her last chance you know my daughter was going to summer school every summer and he is like mrs is you know she is like you know the average student uh um 

Recording: (52/ 2140)

Recording: (53/ 2140) 
okay so people get like fly in do do they do they little waiting things why out 

Recording: (54/ 2140)

Recording: (58/ 2140) 
well it is good now uh while the webably it is changed that there is computers have made a big difference uh it is more exciting now for people who can at a uh uh they were interested in it is more emphasis on information not books and things that go into the library to get any information 

Recording: (59/ 2140) 
and so you know even though it turns out to be the real traditional breakdown it is not it is not because i have to it is not because he you know he would not do something that that something else it is this suits me fine

Recording: (84/ 2140) 
and not that that changed my opinion for um but back then and nobody would talk about it and you know i just think in today is world we need to bring subjects like that out no one because there is so many people who are a shame about things and they should not be a shame because it is a lifestyle anymore you know i just it needs to be brought up more 

Recording: (85/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (86/ 2140) 
mothers he used to be a principal of mine in elementary school so uh he is like i i think we should talk i was like okay great because i do not like uh boy you are way too serious okay so i know we knew at the time the laws were coming to the door so i i um at this point i um point out that the paper that i went downstairs for i do not know where that is i never found it never saw it never it it is anyway not relevant at all of the story but it bugs me every time i told the story because it does not exist anyway 

Recording: (87/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (88/ 2140) 
little house for the bunch of guys on that yeah so fully different um one of the things that i really enjoyed that was different as the traffic and that really no that really that really became really became uh interesting in different for me when i started working for a career the service winter quarter i took off i took all classes off winter quarter and worked for career service and i need some money and i love driving and let me tell you it is really really different 

Recording: (89/ 2140) 
and there is some people that deserve to be fired and there is no way that you can really different age just because they are in a union they 

Recording: (90/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (91/ 2140) 
there was i do not there was nothing there that really i can remember that did anything good for me i mean i think middle school taught me a lot more or the nice school 

Recording: (92/ 2140) 
for the the slick image bothers me uh he has the potential of of traveling gore i think that goor will be the the nomination no matter what bradley does gore has it sewn up because he is the insiders uh it 

Recording: (93/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (94/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (95/ 2140)

Recording: (96/ 2140) 
to the other side 

Recording: (97/ 2140) 
carable murderers you know away with murder now by that plea bargain that plea bargain i think is the most thing that ever was passed i do not think they are she would be in any plea bargains and they would be so horrible but there are people who get murdered you know instead of electric chair electric chair i still believe in it because if someone is pure and i do not believe that they should have ten years of uh what do they call that legal process where they can putting appeals you think you that is it 

Recording: (98/ 2140) 
yeah because i mean five years went by like <laugh> 

Recording: (99/ 2140)

Recording: (105/ 2140) 
and i do a lot of music interviewing and writing there and then i moved up to editor and it was sort of threw that job but i got my first job with tony while i was as a as a sort of ohio representative so i was concentrated in ohio state and then you know basically it is just something i am not doing this as a career right or something i am doing in the meantime to i decide whether i am going back to school or 

Recording: (106/ 2140) 
she is grown it she uh she is expanded her horizon if you will and 

Recording: (107/ 2140) 
i do not have any evidence to uh to support it i just know that i have it i feel that i have it distinct they just uh a very clear there is a boil between what is uh back in what a friction what is true and was a magicary and uh so for me i do not think that television has affected me in that way um i mean one way that like television has affected me is i am full of media references 

Recording: (108/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (109/ 2140)

Recording: (120/ 2140) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (121/ 2140)

um yeah that is what they suggest doing is two years of medical get a phd and then do last years of medical 

Recording: (124/ 2140) 
oh there always has been there always has been i think a lot of people feel that kids a lot of kids are on medication today that should not be but uh i think that is the fault of the school or the parents or some doctor that like for example and we have refer kids in arlington to a doctor we have a list of three doctors that we work with and we know is that they will not just give this kid a pill if he does not have eight out of the twelve systems or 

Recording: (125/ 2140) 
i am sure i am sure it is you know it is just the circles i move in 

Recording: (126/ 2140) 
oh i see yeah 

Recording: (127/ 2140) 
ten years no question about it that that you are in jail for ten years eighteen years old you have got anything on ten years that is it you know and you look at some of these other people like sports people and

Recording: (131/ 2140) 
needs for that budget they bought things on a cash basis as they needed it they did not go out and spend on credit and uh many of them some of the hemisphere but business said hey let us produce these lines little uh new you want a refrigerator room we can make it for you know we can make it cheap for you because we can mass produce it 

Recording: (132/ 2140) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (133/ 2140) 
i mean i did not get the greatest chance as i do not think any of us they really had the best you know but but i do not i have been talking to my kid to the way of some of these people talk to her eight maybe zips or something like that and she wanted to sit here a mommy so she made her sit with her which is cool and mama just goes to sleep and little kid is trying to study her homework you know

Recording: (135/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (136/ 2140) 
his mother died uh the week after he got married she had die beets um uh juvenile die beets i did not know see the age eleven and just over the years uh um and then to having open heart surgery and then they get through the surgery my grandmother also died during open heart surgery so my perception of open heart surgery even though i am a nurse <laugh> it is not very good just because of the two 

Recording: (137/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (138/ 2140) 
deer space nine in that uh yeah different people of different i mean these were alien rather than different ethnic denominated of humans but it it approach that from a less um from a more realistic standpoint in instead of having you know like an old star trek you know everyone gets along then we come 

Recording: (139/ 2140) 
um originally on the more side 

Recording: (140/ 2140) 
my son now i saw him one let us see he was fifteen maybe he would run across the street one month of the eighty six year old lady across the street was trying to brin her garbage down he would seen me do that he go oh let me get that for you martha she is got ours right and she looks like she is going to fall she takes steps about this big and and i have seen him do that 

Recording: (141/ 2140) 
then you are really going to get out of it what you need to 

Recording: (142/ 2140) 
the door to um buy his home suits my sophomore year and he was a cash year there 

Recording: (143/ 2140) 
in adequate but that was even through nursing school i mean those were not things that were discussed you get special conference to get information on that 

Recording: (144/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (145/ 2140) 
umhum yeah 

Recording: (146/ 2140) 
uh 

Recording: (147/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (148/ 2140) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (149/ 2140) 
yeah i like that 

Recording: (150/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (151/ 2140) 
yeah but i have gotten more influence i think maybe i am not sure i am hoping i have got more influence over him than his father does 

Recording: (152/ 2140) 
yeah i mean i would want to see how the season ends out it is just a lot of the ones this season to me have just been disappointing the i mean i think every show is sort of has a peak some shows peek towards the end some at the beginning and sort of level off but uh the the simpsons had a stretch from a like their third year through like their seventh where things were just like unbelievable funny and then they had some writing changes i think and this this season is just 

Recording: (153/ 2140) 
and we started talking again and it was just like we had missed our time and started dating 

Recording: (154/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (155/ 2140) 
whereas i do not know luther and it is a little bit more open to 

Recording: (156/ 2140) 
so we have really never had a lot of use for the union but recently we just figured out that you know if they decide to strike we have no choice too and you can not work because they will take all the money you make across in that line so you can out work anybody that came back to work will lose all the money that they made do not take them to court you know they can not yeah it is against the union contract so you have just 

Recording: (157/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (158/ 2140) 
um i think that i do not think the divorce is the bad thing i think that it is if your married and you will by the size that you get to a point where you and this other person are are not an positive relationship for each other or for anybody else in your family that it is better to just a this is not working we both deserve to be happy and we and and and go your own separate ways um 

Recording: (159/ 2140) 
it kind of yeah so old i have seen worseers so <laugh> um um so i am in they are doing this i think kids called sit and reach where he is got to sit on the floor and he is got to raise his feet up just so and and he is got to take his hands and reach towards his toes and they do that for or you know late five minutes first time they increase it and he really hates it 

Recording: (160/ 2140) 
but then that hurts the the the administrators in the sense that they are there to provide education so maybe rough in like my high school they they put up cameras and they like they lock bathrooms like at certain times you can go in on it was getting and they had like we were on the front page to actually i can be comfortable because they had a lock down where no one was allowed to leave their classroom and then they brought this the dog is threw and they found i 

Recording: (161/ 2140) 
you can not you can not be mad at somebody for choosing life style you just can not life is too short you know i mean you can love them either way it does not make any difference 

Recording: (162/ 2140) 
that is why it is mainly appealing to people you they pay you to go to school 

Recording: (163/ 2140) 
i forget they have uh like way more than like they dwarf in the other state i think so that to me is not that is not adroable and then i i so that is one reason i would not vote for blood this 

Recording: (164/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (165/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (166/ 2140) 
um i am signed up for art protection right now which i like art protection but i think there is probably more time into it than i am ready to actually commit into it 

Recording: (167/ 2140) 
yeah hard to be cut though

Recording: (227/ 2140)

Recording: (228/ 2140) 
well unfortunately i do not think it is fair but i think in the long run it does not have to be a college education because most of those people probably would not want a college vacation uh but like a trade or a skill or something that will give them a little bit of hope if they do want to choose to get a job instead of right i mean to bank or selling drugs or whatever they did they have that choice it is it is it is up on their head okay i can either go become a welder or 

Recording: (229/ 2140) 
in the business world in other words i used to work uh during uh high school days for a furniture company and those days was nine days okay so we just uh and talk to the man to well they they do not have the they do not have the money to pay the money to the bank well why are we still left to them though well we will get our money back the bank the bank for the money and we will get a we will repossess it and we still do the same to my thing over three or four times

no no um my i was born in new york i was in play um i then i went to tennessee with my family and uh right it was six months 

Recording: (233/ 2140) 
i you know from my perspective which is skewed of course to me i think it just seems that way i mean it was we are only talking about ten cases that is not very many you know i mean you could by coincidence have them all be african american um if i were african american i think i would have a different perspective and i you know i do not do not live in the neighborhood where we see a lot of police so uh you know i just do not i am i am not in touch with it 

Recording: (234/ 2140) 
um sector and i think that is a good sign but i think there is a huge there is millions of children that do not have any health care and that is not right there is like there is a a lot of like between the low in the opera there is a huge disparity but at least it is a step in the right direction we have a a nice south middle middle income middle income middle income middle income base i think because a lot of countries only have the like i visit of mexico and seems like they only had the distinctive between the opera and lower i mean their middle class is very small and that i 

Recording: (235/ 2140) 
um

Recording: (238/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (239/ 2140) 
um well actually it is sort of all happening in a certain area you know with you know very high unemployment like council council states um you know this sort of stereotypes you know kind of bad family environment you know parents have lots of boyfriend and girlfriend drugs everything else and you know a lot of these girls that have been interviewed yeah 

Recording: (240/ 2140) 
i am going to like oh english people your accents so neat and all that kind of thing and then when i went there you know i and this was actually one of my friends but i remember you know she was german and she was sort of asking me how you say different words and things and then she sort of looked at me and she said like oh actually i should not be asking you know i do not wanna learn the american way to say those like i wanna learn the predish way and people would say things all the time and it was you know they would ask you what your background was and if he would say well i am american they said well you know like where are your 

Recording: (241/ 2140) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (242/ 2140) 
as far as i was concerned for what they were doing um you know one got one principal that from my um daughter is high school he was out pretty and all the time they you know they he was he was right around in a corvette and uh he tried to take me out 

Recording: (243/ 2140)

Recording: (244/ 2140) 
they went they went to private schools they went to private schools i certainly did not want them to go to public schools and even when going to the high state uh compared to miami university i i see differences in the standards of the of the students uh but i believe and i have seen it with my son going out of the state that his more  girls that he is gained through his uh pre college years are staying with him uh and i am very grateful that there is 

Recording: (245/ 2140) 
or to do anything extreme to their bodies 

Recording: (246/ 2140) 
there and everything that uh they will tend to talk to maybe you were talking to somebody else then uh like in the thorties if they are not believe it anymore they say

right 

Recording: (248/ 2140) 
uh fifty percent of everyone who marri is is divorced within a matter of about five years as i understand the statistics today and uh uh unfortunately it is still increasing but there is a strong feeling that maybe this going to slowly reverse or at least decrease not reverse probably um once again we are talking about communications too uh and the communications can be ill and they can be great uh as she is touched 

Recording: (249/ 2140) 
christal clarity and they will just run with it and that is what my mom came out of um her her denomphous init she came out of she is not part of it any more denomination she came out of it um some of the more devout churches within the apistolic christian church we are talking men sit on the one side and women sit on the other women wear little finney is on their head no jewelry the in thedman is read in three different languages <laugh>

yeah 

Recording: (251/ 2140) 
umhum well you you had a had a good reason to be bothered 

Recording: (252/ 2140) 
because then you know what is something major happens that first and then what but i think at least for children especially because they have no means to to help them ohs and like the parents obviously even if they are working a lot of times can not get health care for their children so i think at least for children because how many actions happen to children like he will always breaking arms and stuff 

Recording: (253/ 2140) 
saying that they wanted to save this nice white girl because i had so much potential and uh they were not going to let me throw my life away like this well i was you know it was bizarre and so i was always from that time on the other side of these these people are all crazy i have never going to i am never going to be like that and so i have a whole lot of different values from my family and it is real hard for them because all my other siblings who are younger are willing to

Recording: (259/ 2140)

<laugh> 

Recording: (330/ 2140)

Recording: (393/ 2140) 
i think it has changed drastically and i think it is changing and i think it will also be changing in the future uh going all the way back gulf finances uh we are we are not a consideration in the in oh i would say probably my first thirty maybe forty years there was some there was infoance but i think the influence was not financial it was influenced from the person who could get up here and talk with a group of people and sway them with 

Recording: (394/ 2140) 
is that right 

Recording: (395/ 2140) 
sure 

Recording: (396/ 2140) 
exactly 

Recording: (397/ 2140) 
yeah got into a situation where you really were there was no wind situation from the good go and uh uh i think that had we been able to do what we you went over there to do it initially it would have worked out okay but we were not so so the capital political war is everybody knows anything about it 

Recording: (398/ 2140) 
got a ways to go just getting better 

Recording: (399/ 2140)

Recording: (406/ 2140) 
um 

Recording: (407/ 2140) 
<laugh> yeah there is a lot we need to do a lot of involving <laugh> we definitely do 

Recording: (408/ 2140) 
i think it was a a nice thing about what we had uh we had uh grandparents that were not necessarily they were out of state in some cases we did not see them that much we made a part that uh we communicate with the grandparents regularly and when we did it was a special time we um emphasize the fact that uh uh you know kids want to do certain things okay they saw their mother go out and maybe do some additional things to 

Recording: (409/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (410/ 2140) 
forced to take this course like i think that if i i mean it is good to being forced to take abroad like a liberal arts thing because you like you do not know what you i want to do so it is like if like you hate math and you do not take it up at all but then you decide you want to do something to math and you are like screwed like can not go back 

Recording: (411/ 2140) 
i do kind of 

Recording: (412/ 2140) 
oh really 

Recording: (413/ 2140) 
um well as far as my mom goes she is real into the catholic faith and i mean she made me always go to church and things like that 

Recording: (414/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (415/ 2140) 
but it and it is it is parents that fight for the society and what is in your community you know the parents for each individual child they have to all form to yeah there is a group and almost be upheaance to all these kids as a group you know it is not you can be the best parent in the world at home and then your kid goes to school in his access is the computer or they get in a group of kids where they are parents they do not even know where they are you know it is the kids responsibility to get and go to school you know maybe the mom and 

Recording: (416/ 2140) 
at home we interact the school is great you have people that are on the clock whoop trying to quit they are gone those people do not know the meaning of life they will never know the meaning of life but if they stay around try to extend themselves a little more with somebody that is have problems at work and are willing to work with that person i say willing to work not knowing they are going to be compensated because they will be compensated 

Recording: (417/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (418/ 2140) 
you know like the two <laugh> fisherman that found him at see you never hear about the other one because that this was on one just briefly i heard on the news because he thinks he should go back to his father but you do not hear about him there is three cousins two of them think he should stay up in my amy the other one thinks he should get back with his father you do not hear about him it is reading about him newsweek or some place uh so i think the news media is not been totally objective about this 

Recording: (419/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (420/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (421/ 2140) 
they are covered but it was real tricky because she sort of had some of them she was a us citizen she found a lot through the mail over the interstate back in generally you know like in nineteen ninety eight he was real early and went over there and married the guy uh and so she had some of the medical problems and she am a great health and uh it was just it took years to get that straightened up but she is covered now 

Recording: (422/ 2140) 
how many times you have been in ireland 

Recording: (423/ 2140) 
if they had a way to cure it then fine but leave it up to the people 

Recording: (424/ 2140) 
that is how i feel that is that is what i believe in i just believe that 

Recording: (425/ 2140) 
well it is like the i 

Recording: (426/ 2140) 
just can not go on i thought if they are going to stop it totally 

Recording: (427/ 2140) 
going to be a really busy day and i would the same thing in poor columbus you know i i would see all these cars but it would be just about the same traffic and i am like and i mentioned somebody go where are the extra the they go they can not add extra airplanes it is they have certain routes they can do they just have to put bigger airplanes on but said you know you will see larger airplanes when it is day time so they can put more people on so 

Recording: (428/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (429/ 2140) 
oh 

Recording: (430/ 2140) 
yeah could not get me to pay the rent <laugh> that is yeah <laugh> 

Recording: (431/ 2140) 
there was snow or something 

Recording: (432/ 2140) 
yeah so she said she is going to be catching the disability bus out here you know after the third round so i am she is going to ride that bus 

Recording: (433/ 2140) 
or more accurately i think she took it but they need it to find mine um and so she wears that around and i replaced it so i have my own again i wear this one around so we have competition to see who you can get the most well traveled to bring you get two points every country and you get one point for every state or problems within that country 

Recording: (434/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (435/ 2140) 
umhum uhhuh 

Recording: (436/ 2140) 
i i like to talk about columbus <laugh> 

Recording: (437/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (438/ 2140) 
oh okay that is good 

Recording: (439/ 2140) 
what we should buy yeah they because what we should buy and that is the problem we listen to business too much if business reemphasized their goals to help society out and not themselves 

Recording: (440/ 2140) 
and i think um of course we would all hope that abortion would not be that that nobody would have an abortion that would be the perfect world is nobody would ever be in a situation where they would need one um but i also think i you know i i mean yeah they should not be they should not and she does not spend six weeks on abortion <laugh> or six weeks on what to do if you are pregnant uh but but i think the subject has to be mentioned just just in passing 

Recording: (441/ 2140) 
i think for the most part people can handle it uh obviously i think probably more the older generations would be the ones that have the bigger problem with that the ones that grew up like during the whole black rights movement and things like that um i could see them having a problem with it but i mean more like like more of the generations today or whatever like basically anyone down to the age of about forty or fifty so i think that they could they could probably deal with it i mean i do not think it 

Recording: (442/ 2140) 
you know i mean i like earl bruce and i uh waited on him a couple of times at a restaurant and i worked out he was a nicest man and when they did that i do not know if you know about that one they fired him the davis for having an nine to three season three years in a row they fired him the day before that game

Recording: (452/ 2140)

Recording: (453/ 2140) 
yeah it is my daughter yeah umhum

they have uh you know you come from a situation like that that does not mean you have to be like that do you know what i mean kind of 

Recording: (468/ 2140) 
i think so i think so if you are willing you know anybody who is willing to put out the effort i mean you do have to you know you have to sell yourself there is you know you are not going to just sit around and wait to be discovered but uh if you put out the effort i really do not i do not think there is that kind of that kind of discrimination any more 

Recording: (469/ 2140) 
yeah that and i think i i am a firm believer that uh little subtle tastes like that to yourself are much better than looking at them are going look at them hips then you go this way and you go i am getting a gut and you know it is like that is so negative to you are would you tell your mom that you know 

Recording: (470/ 2140)

you know talk to her but uh people do not when i was fourteen i did not care what anybody is home i was going to do it no matter what 

Recording: (487/ 2140)

uh it counts if you are touching the ground or something that you are sitting on the touching 

Recording: (490/ 2140) 
um actually i was over there when all of that happened but of course it was all over the papers and you know i think i mean i i do not know what it was like really here i can imagine but i mean they are especially they really focused on um not collin byne but the one with the the younger kids in arkansas was it d before i was there from both of those but you know in the first one you know they they put the picture of the little kid in combat gear holding the gun everywhere

Recording: (495/ 2140) 
i hope so yeah <laugh> 

Recording: (496/ 2140) 
and so i think it gets driven home i think the media does that in a lot of places they pick something that is sensational on keep them they are making it even more sensationaly type than uh uh john kennedy type 

Recording: (497/ 2140) 
it is really beautiful out there we like we like mountains and you know walk around uh we got married to lake tahoe which is really beautiful 

Recording: (498/ 2140)

Recording: (500/ 2140) 
he is a picky eater which he you know he he does not like everything 

Recording: (501/ 2140)

Recording: (509/ 2140) 
like i am not i am not really sure like how they how the interview works to become a teacher um i do not know i think it is like a lot of times they are really desperate to find people and so they really just take whoever i mean they are lucky enough to even have a bought i need to feel that this place and they are doing well enough i mean the kids are learning it is material i mean sort of i mean i i mean i it is working well enough i guess 

Recording: (510/ 2140) 
north 

Recording: (511/ 2140) 
oh because that goes with the disorder they know they know when who is button to push and when not to push the button and how far they can go and you know where the line is and they push you all the way that is the way teachers they uh they drive the teacher up the wall 

Recording: (512/ 2140) 
i think society is today uh today is less tolerant of uh a lot of things that they see where people getting along with this stuff you know and they are more vocal boy back in the sixties and stuff you know uh not here but you down south there people still getting hung and stuff you know for being a black or something and uh you know there are bad blacks and there are bad whites too you know so 

Recording: (513/ 2140) 
so 

Recording: (514/ 2140) 
i 

Recording: (515/ 2140) 
you know so you can use all those opportunities to show your kid what not to do 

Recording: (516/ 2140) 
well i mean to me the whole thing is wrong regardless of if you are guilty or innocent to me there is worse than worse things i would think than than dying you know the you you like i know an just the guy who kills etsacrobeen he got locked up and he is not allowed to see it because it um under jewish law you can not kill 

Recording: (517/ 2140) 
and now it is our turn to deal with the issues we see our parents we see this generation that all these things they are still populous so we do not look down on the sixty i mean i think the sixty sounds like a pretty fun time to live i will get into politics in a second um but those things are popularized but no we can not do it any more because we have got these problems um

Recording: (841/ 2140) 
women really do not need as well as but it is there for them and they do participate um 

Recording: (842/ 2140) 
oh okay well the reason i asked was a lot it seems to me a lot of the in particular going to church or going back to church for people is when their kid gets old enough to go to sunday school <laugh> starting asking questions about religion and you are saying well i suppose i get answer all these but <laugh> <laugh> yeah

Recording: (849/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (850/ 2140) 
i would say and then i would also say that you know uh because i i a number of reasons that people do not vote for school at least now is because they do not have kids in the schools you know but education is the foundation of a democracy and if you do not have an educated citizenry uh your democracy could go down the drain um that was right almost the other and found it so many schools or you know the the university of virginia and believed in education you know because he said without an educated citizen you will not understand the issues if it 

Recording: (851/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (852/ 2140) 
um 

Recording: (853/ 2140) 
humum 

Recording: (854/ 2140) 
groups in different looks but i can not help but thinking that if it was bad enough that you would do something like that that you know had to have been more than just you know sort of normal drugs versus whatever so i think it should be more i do not know i mean even you know i went to a private 

Recording: (855/ 2140) 
and you know you have a hard thing there but then if you teach the teachers that they are not going to be quite and they are not going to you know um look at this flatterie 

Recording: (856/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (857/ 2140) 
yeah it is um 

Recording: (858/ 2140) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (859/ 2140)

Recording: (863/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (864/ 2140) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (865/ 2140)

um no other words the house i did not want it so that was easy 

Recording: (870/ 2140) 
i i at that type one time i kind of wanted to be a teacher and everything but course that would have been an unporty nice uh it would have been probably what about twenty four so i was that about twenty five years and so i period really get to heck out anyway you know 

Recording: (871/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (872/ 2140) 
you know so basically well yeah it might work what you means kind of stupid you know because what you are saying is we are going to take this lawn we are really going to stick you on this lawn but to hell with all the other oh so is that really fair 

Recording: (873/ 2140) 
it was uh back in the sixties though you know 

Recording: (874/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (875/ 2140) 
i mean i do not think they should get rid of it for a poor thing <laugh> but you know there is plenty of them all to go to this that is okay <laugh> it is not a big deal to me to tell you the truth no actually i live i live close to i live close to i live east of hm 

Recording: (876/ 2140) 
i remember it being it is a pretty positive thing for me i was never upset about the fact that they were not together because they all supposed gave me a lot of attention but um about i think i was maybe five or six my mom went to an apartment in german village 

Recording: (877/ 2140) 
yeah my brother is well he is the oldest oldest but two sisters pretty much all the ones that i really care about two sisters and their husbands 

Recording: (878/ 2140) 
some more expensive but it is like you know picture frame or something there it might be you know twenty five dollars for one so you buy one here oh you know they are five dollars a piece let us buy five you know 

Recording: (879/ 2140) 
yep 

Recording: (880/ 2140) 
umhum you guy across the street you know the poorly highway and you sit and they are going eight 

Recording: (881/ 2140) 
at night it is pretty fun and you just floor it and fly right through the middle of downtown um improvements i would just say i would just say the yeah this place is dirty 

Recording: (882/ 2140) 
yeah but i think carre practice would be more popular for the same type of reason uh yeah i 

Recording: (883/ 2140) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (884/ 2140) 
and she was speaking and and she started to speak i realized you know another thing that i really feel has a tremendous impression on how we as people are doing here but how the politicians are because the world  world in essence it is getting smaller because the communication has gotten better and all these other countries and us there is just like all one country anymore or something and i think that is had a tremendous influence also on in our politics and on we as the people 

Recording: (885/ 2140) 
see tomorrow i mean hold them feel the warms of the body uh here the conversation quietly rather than uh hearing okay time to get out of here i know it was a big or less they but it was presents sort of remark big kind i could elaborate i could write a whole book on that on this on the answer you are quiteers uh but it is these kinds of things are very elementary really they are very elementary i guess too 

Recording: (886/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (887/ 2140) 
right right he would go for weeks he would get mad at me and that would speak to me when i was growing up for a week or two at a time my mother would say please yes i changed my name i went to college i just was and i am out of here i am everything is gone and so he was saying oh nancy please just talk to your father just for just for a nice day please and i was thinking i am a child here i should not have to be the one to make peace with this family if he does not want to talk to me i do not need him i do not have to talk to him 

Recording: (888/ 2140) 
oh it is sort of like the sociology of like quicks you know like how how that develops like how people like some people seek to like fit in like like the pets are real strong uh like 

Recording: (889/ 2140) 
really yeah i do not feel old at all i mean i you know a lot of people think wow you should know what you want to do or you know and and i guess there is different phase like uh massachusetts higherucky what is that the uh the higherucky of needs manly uh massahow anyway 

Recording: (890/ 2140) 
let him beat so speed right now but 

Recording: (891/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (892/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (893/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (894/ 2140) 
well it was both really because there is the kids live there since i live there now thirteen years ago <laugh> and being that long in the same neighborhood just and really get it with me 

Recording: (895/ 2140) 
yeah from the strike end yeah um actually a lot of our stuff did pretty well why we were off uh did not make you feel as needed as you want to do anything you know yeah uh you know we got a lot of our buildings up and running before they went on strike and i think the boss was <laugh> knew this was coming so a lot of the air conditioning was already you run him by then 

Recording: (896/ 2140) 
yeah exactly i know 

Recording: (897/ 2140) 
yeah umhum 

Recording: (898/ 2140) 
it is always been my feeling and and uh i try to be fair in the way i grade uh you know it is i try to be as objective as i can some times i i because i think it is important that people learn how to write i would ask all my classes to write an la or a short 

Recording: (899/ 2140) 
you know 

Recording: (900/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (901/ 2140) 
that is pretty extreme 

Recording: (902/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (903/ 2140) 
oh gosh 

Recording: (904/ 2140) 
their ideas and they mean the guys are trying to look older the girls are trying to look younger 

Recording: (905/ 2140) 
or they made after that they had the lottery number and that was not up to high you know if you got your number was picked i mean i do not know what is it would be worth knowing that you are going to get another of those uh prepare your order uh because i have had friends that got numbers and everything you know and getting a high number and sitting over the whole lot of my god so 

Recording: (906/ 2140) 
um it was just yeah i guess the mafia was a big problem they just take over everything and they they do not pay their workers and most people are not mafia i do not get paid <laugh> 

Recording: (907/ 2140) 
but i do know my my my brotherinlaw mentioned to his uh parents that gosh what a sacrifice you guys did for us and he is just turned fifty and they do not even have any kids and he says well how you did it well for one thing they probably did a lot of sacrifice and when you sacrifice it becomes you it makes you more horrible 

Recording: (908/ 2140) 
uh the younger kids would not think anything about it 

Recording: (909/ 2140) 
uh a type of life style in that life style gone everybody is independent everybody is going their own ways and if you happen to be lucky enough to find somebody that is looking in the same direction you are and as equally as independent then it might it might work but um i you know and he knows why each person gets course i mean each one of them was an individual situation and uh 

Recording: (910/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (911/ 2140) 
uhhuh in the watch those yeah you kind of like you know look it up and says you know it does not even you know got their sites on me yeah because that is uh so you know that is like the world war two stuff you know there is like the remains i am sure it is like we get to see the wall it is like they are i mean i am sure they just like this there it from what from what i understand it was like 

Recording: (912/ 2140) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (913/ 2140) 
so how i this works out you know i do not know i just i am just like okay she just says i just want to get it over with and see now she you know 

Recording: (914/ 2140) 
oh really 

Recording: (915/ 2140) 
to be close so i did not have to drive <laugh> 

Recording: (916/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (917/ 2140) 
see that is great though 

Recording: (918/ 2140) 
um so i mean basically my opinion on that is just leave it up to them i mean if they want to take the risks obviously they know <laugh> 

Recording: (919/ 2140) 
have you have have you if you if you say bye by from those unscriptionsless business people and say uh jeez these guys got down the what happens to that person that thousand bankruptcy uh my bankruptcy okay i will just something else again the next next thing 

Recording: (920/ 2140) 
well i really think that is happening right now because i think that i do not know what the divorce statistics have been recently but i do see that more people who are getting back married or staying married because those that do not those that would have gotten the divorce they are not bothering to get married to begin with they are just living together and then they separate so what and i think that 

Recording: (921/ 2140) 
yeah and it it has the least amount of people which is kind of neat as far as tourism so 

Recording: (922/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (923/ 2140) 
i am looking for a part that i am job as to speak i have been like doing temporary on and off as the thing with that is you can work you know for four or five months and then nothing and then like that so right now i am looking for something permanent 

Recording: (924/ 2140) 
you know just experiencing someone for who they are and so she is 

Recording: (925/ 2140) 
couple restaurants or something but i mean it is it is different when you think of other cities you know it is more of like a downtown is where you got to hang out but here it is like campus and he or more of uh 

Recording: (926/ 2140) 
it was just so i did not object to that one at all 

Recording: (927/ 2140) 
that that would be seriously fun but uh it depends if you work in the street you get money 

Recording: (928/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (929/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (930/ 2140) 
and they were just wild you know i just ran every minute and i took it as a substitute and did not know from day to day you know whether it was going to keep it i finally had to say i can not do that twenty seven kindergarten i am sorry i can not do this by my self <laugh> 

Recording: (931/ 2140) 
um meat or 

Recording: (932/ 2140) 
yeah drugs right yeah yeah see that is what she is interested in right now she is looking to see if she can find someplace to work this summer even if it is just a day a week you know some clinic or something just to see what is going on day to day 

Recording: (933/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (934/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (935/ 2140) 
uh it is a pretty pretty it is it and uh you know enough around there to it is a it is a classic school up on the west side 

Recording: (936/ 2140) 
and uh i just told them what i have to do with my belief system say air of violation on the first amendment you know so and then they realized that i was not stupid so so you know they just made things more and more difficult for me yeah so i just decided uh since they were not going to change those it is going to leave them but so it is you know it is it is a hard way it is just uh walk uh if you are an idealistic person it is i mean just in yourself 

Recording: (937/ 2140) 
is it any worse than baseball cards or you know 

Recording: (938/ 2140) 
and he said do worse and more acceptable divorce should never be acceptable 

Recording: (939/ 2140) 
yeah i had a cousin that went on she she was in school for that and um as you could tell i like to do office work i 

Recording: (940/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (941/ 2140) 
yeah that is how we get so much money he says i we will be paid this much and i will be given this many this much minimum per day or i am not working for you and they usually say no no no we will not do that you know and then they will call back a week later okay we will take you he has some really good stories about that oh yeah yeah is quality is not the best and also with uh unix which is 

Recording: (942/ 2140) 
hum 

Recording: (943/ 2140) 
<laugh> whole lot more places to live it seems like everywhere i turn there is construction and and you know you go down one one road and then you wait a couple of years if you do not go in that area yeah and it is all changed looks all different so and that is mainly like looking up that is all and three fifteen door things like that 

Recording: (944/ 2140) 
you know he was in oh yeah they both work during college and i guess my dad was on the gi bill after the war so that is how he got in here had to work some part time work to get his degree just east broad street just franklin park and service 

Recording: (945/ 2140) 
i mean that goes along with my customers and all these i mean we are gonna send our child i already know to parochial schools there is no way i am going to send them to a public school and even my my husband is a um boy scout um leader and just listening to the boys there he he he did a program last night on respect 

Recording: (946/ 2140) 
the ultimate would probably be a part type thing you know but neither one of our positions offer any type of part time work we have some friends that do that where or they only go two days a week or something which is they get a little bit of both the world so 

Recording: (947/ 2140) 
do i think they will oh yes i think they definitely will i think there is so much heavy uh political and financial well i am a reverse that statement uh there is so much heavy financial infoluents upon the political uh influence that it it is almost a four gone conclusion and if it does not occur this within this year and uh there may be another vote in another year or in the in the next election but i think that in fact it will go 

Recording: (948/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (949/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (950/ 2140) 
you know 

Recording: (951/ 2140) 
yeah that is what i am saying 

Recording: (952/ 2140) 
yeah uh yeah they they have had two different uh articles in there uh about it well they had a big article uh back when uh it was uh jesse jackson was down there so so in a couple years ago or something and uh he made a concerted effort to try let people know how poor uh most poor is not he down there and everything but then you go to a lot of other extremes you know where you sit down and these people would not wanna live in crime 

Recording: (953/ 2140) 
i mean i think he is done some kinds of things that whole thing about uh as far as like your student loan and being able to get into <laugh> that just helps me you know oh and i think you know all this that as far as some of the issues go i think that that i feel pretty similar to the way he does um some of his foreign policy i think i have gone pretty decently but i mean i think i do not i do not know i mean i 

Recording: (954/ 2140) 
yeah from what i hear actually the like the amory and the um the university of chicago you have to work really hard because they get all the kids who wish they would have gotten a harvard and then start you know try to make it up by working harder you get the actual harvard nobody works because they are like we already made it you know 

Recording: (955/ 2140) 
i i will that is a that is a tough one uh i liked that but they were like to borrow their boys and stuff you know or those put them in the still of the hall the fake anyway you know but and to me that is fake you know uh and i never really thought about while i was growing up as it was what was around when everything uh always knew that by i gar again you know by my dad being home 

Recording: (956/ 2140) 
he he he is a very he is a disappointment 

Recording: (957/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (958/ 2140) 
we will do this and we will do this so we checked out the catholic school and they were organized that way and it is just was a better better match for him and then by my daughter went to school was just easier to take them to the same school and and they goes back and they comes back to and they tell me about another thing i want to say about my them disciplined in in behavior made to be different in the classic school is you paint they you paint box you know it is a fourth out forty five hundred dollars a year for us to send her to school umhum 

Recording: (959/ 2140) 
yeah i figure right now i might as well take advantage of it 

Recording: (960/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (961/ 2140) 
busman my dad and i have been screwing around with dogs for years um i am been in contact with a um day trading firm down in west virginia and they are starting an internal program sometime i do not even know but if that if that opens up i will probably seriously consider going down to west virginia they are in ridgechman west virginia near richmond uh i have been saying west virginia how about they they are virginia i am sorry they are home basis in uh richmond virginia so 

Recording: (962/ 2140) 
the year and then i went into the army in nineteen forty spring of nineteen forty one before poor law and there is uh service for uh uh four and a half years in italy most of that time north africa and then italy and uh i admit it i i got over before i went into service and so 

Recording: (963/ 2140) 
then when i found out there was so many openingsings in special ed so and then i found out later that speech therapy is a very good background for ld because a lot of these ld kids have language deficits and language froms they they can not you know like express themselves on paper or they do not keep process things correctly auditorly so that is the perfect background to work with ld kids i did not know i was doing that at the time but 

Recording: (964/ 2140) 
i made a difference 

Recording: (965/ 2140) 
well that is great 

Recording: (966/ 2140) 
yes and uh uh we are in boy scouts we got kicked out of it <laugh> 

Recording: (967/ 2140) 
and uh well she the the people that own it are starting to build it up now but it is been like that it was the first department community uh some of us that was built in thirty eight i guess 

Recording: (968/ 2140) 
um yeah people that live there i mean we have got the the you know the indian department stores right down their own high street and and a couple of asian groceries but i <laugh> you know i i i do not know where they live <laugh> i it it seems it seems like for those stores to be opening there they must be somewhere in clintonville but i do not i do not know 

Recording: (969/ 2140) 
all right 

Recording: (970/ 2140) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (971/ 2140) 
i do not know i i would not personally like think that the parents should be held responsible i mean they do have you know a certain amount of responsibility just because they should have been more aware and and especially because i mean i believe that those at least one of the two had been in counseling and had to you know was doing it a grussian management or something like that um you know you would think that if they were going through something like that you would just sort of you know maybe 

Recording: (972/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (973/ 2140) 
was it true this year about it you know it is like you know 

Recording: (974/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (975/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (976/ 2140) 
well basically it is the same thing here but some of your management is real good i have seen people that that you know are super but i have seen people that are bad the problem is you get a bad management and it can make your life hell i do not care who you are 

Recording: (977/ 2140) 
all you do is you just keep your records of of um you know what you spend on things and then there is a form you fill out and how much you have if you have taken need to appreciate you know you need to basically put that back in and deduct your costs and then there is a percentage that goes on your schedule either goes on the front of your form that goes into your income and then it is just taxed it is just a it is really not that hard 

Recording: (978/ 2140) 
than 

Recording: (979/ 2140) 
umhum yeah i am just learning the area so but i like it so far it seems really nice and uh so it seems like there is a lot more to do upon calling this obviously but 

Recording: (980/ 2140) 
um 

Recording: (981/ 2140) 
everyone everyone might experiment or try or make a mistake but the way he is handling it saying i am not even going to be going to be able to try that question over and over and over if he did not do it he might as well just be like no i did not do it 

Recording: (982/ 2140) 
downtown which is where this my one of my orchestras plays a lot and uh we sang in other different kinds of churches and said what we liked about them what we did not <laugh> maybe it had some feedback i think the new building is acoustically very good it is certainly much better than old wood ship center because i do not know if you have seen a picture or anything of the church but the old warship center was designed by a modern architect 

Recording: (983/ 2140) 
umhum at this point um i am not uh i am not against the urban schools but if that was my own personal child i would not move move to a suburban area until columbus gets their act together they are in so it is such a bad shape right now that i do think the state will take over the columbus public schools in two years yeah they have threatened it uh and if they do not pull their scores up uh they will you know 

Recording: (984/ 2140) 
and move on um that is that is basically my fear but uh as one of the guys trying to help me say well listen i am afraid of that too so because right there in that pit there that is god now if you remember that there is nothing in here that it even as hot as it gets you know and when you think about that you try not to think too much while you are in there although 

Recording: (985/ 2140) 
are not they you know they come back to visit me sometimes from the high school 

Recording: (986/ 2140) 
yeah it is ridiculous i mean plus it is a nationally recognized school so a degree from the house state i mean you could go anywhere in the nation someone is at least going to recognize because the big it is a big big name actually it would be more of a sell i would be like okay we it is small it is private it is credited but so 

Recording: (987/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (988/ 2140) 
no matter how much money they are giving for their education they 

Recording: (989/ 2140) 
yeah i think mostly they did uh i was kind of surprised uh which classes is i think this was a better production to the arts class kind of surprised that one of the students in my class thought it was very hard <laugh> and i did not think it was that hard at all but she wrote me some kind of national you know at the last class or before the last class but she had a straight a average at the school before that my class and i was giving her a b and she was her 

Recording: (990/ 2140) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (991/ 2140) 
uh i do not know where he got the contact but anyway he went up to boon iowa and joined the national guard out uh which was filled over he and uh with the expectation of their being mobilized which they were and uh so he he was home one weekend and talked to me about i do not know the well field of upv as exposed to that one as uh in rotc at eames so i so that is be better than carrying 

Recording: (992/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (993/ 2140) 
enough kids out there that need love and 

Recording: (994/ 2140) 
but and when it came down to it i mean the what was the protest really about you know and i am not being clear because i am not exactly sure where i am going i am very cynical about the world i have inherited uh because i see a world in which my political view they in sort of like propaganda 

Recording: (995/ 2140) 
um i went to let us see i applied to amory harvard duke university of chicago and washington university so i got into three of those um 

Recording: (996/ 2140) 
have no idea <laugh> 

Recording: (997/ 2140) 
oh yes 

Recording: (998/ 2140) 
yeah he is up there too the old guy beard and a twed jacket you know it is pretty cool and uh they said most you know most of student that are not even from delaware

Recording: (1107/ 2140) 
i mean i think they could try if their you know their kids try and push them away they sit and you know let their kids push them away you know it gets you can not make your kid go out with you and do things 

Recording: (1108/ 2140) 
too much of a role model figure anymore um i mean obviously it should be something that they respect but i can not say that they would be like oh well he does it so i am going to to do it too or whatever

Recording: (1257/ 2140)

Recording: (1348/ 2140) 
umhum right 

Recording: (1349/ 2140)

Recording: (1351/ 2140) 
just just kind of instincts i guess yeah actually they are quite a there is a an a a well pretty well known doctor that has a ton of books and i go to l atl league and that is kind of their philosophy in a way yeah just that breast feeding is you know a way to mother and 

Recording: (1352/ 2140)

Recording: (1353/ 2140) 
yeah it is kind of fun 

Recording: (1354/ 2140) 
um 

Recording: (1355/ 2140) 
i would not have been smiling from down there that up here when he got me off <laugh> 

Recording: (1356/ 2140) 
wam freshman year and ever sing along with them was accurate it was really really really funny we would lose something expensive by the end of the year and had my bike  doing william will william will and the big one that i was going to mention was william will either grow in his face significantlyly or will go the exact opposite direction and i knew one or i know that what happened because on the type i mean my roommate my freshman year for the first quarter was a drug dealer oh 

Recording: (1357/ 2140) 
well i agree that we should help them maybe through some sort of government program but i think what really hurts them the most is the people that actually give them the money on in high street because it really does not motivate them to get out of the gutter i mean if they can make a living off of bagging change off of college students they are probably going to stay with that because it is really easy life 

Recording: (1358/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (1359/ 2140) 
not on the airplans but on the hauling systems 

Recording: (1360/ 2140) 
it is a lot of the it looks looking feels is a lot a lot the same 

Recording: (1361/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1362/ 2140) 
and then how so as far as that to them when you have a chance to talk to them that is what we need to learn more from interview have more meaningful interviews of these people so that we can learn from them i put them up the we do not want to get the negative answer because all my heard the image of the university oh gee now uh we who was it cats and lawyers i oh we uh 

Recording: (1363/ 2140) 
and uh they are very into capitalism and their lives are working pretty good for them so 

Recording: (1364/ 2140) 
umhum yeah because they think they are grown they think they are grown and they are like twelve and thirteen and they have been having sex since they were ten and it is just like <laugh> and yeah and they are having babies earlier and earlier and it is just really scary 

Recording: (1365/ 2140) 
anything else is a hard way failure you need to be fixed somewhere else anyway so if you know how to put an operating system on your machine you can start over if you can start over there is no reason to be scared of anything that you do problem number one in playing with computers for most people is being afraid that they are going to break something 

Recording: (1366/ 2140) 
<laugh> um um in the air and it is both fun and free okay so uh my friend of course and i are up there playing on the computer and uh my sister is down so she was watching television it sunday morning and um i am trying to figure out how this game works trying to figure out this game works and then i said i i got some information on this game out in the car i am gonna go get it 

Recording: (1367/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1368/ 2140) 
you know there is things about my dad that that i went to work with and and he he is great and he is wonderful to meet i mean my dad it is really wonderful to me but i mean things like like where my mom had me he he did not pick her up from the hospital i mean it is that kind of stuff that you would think what the hell were you thinking 

Recording: (1369/ 2140) 
such such an idea uh and that indeed is going to take away from family i can not in my way of thinking i can not imagine that i would uh have my wife producing somebody else is child over here and i am going to have this same thing is that i think that is exactly fatherly love fatherly value fatherly instinct toward 

Recording: (1370/ 2140) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (1371/ 2140) 
exactly huge 

Recording: (1372/ 2140) 
hm 

Recording: (1373/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (1374/ 2140) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (1375/ 2140) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (1376/ 2140) 
and we would uh i just the guns called down shift so they could come within reasonable close to that 

Recording: (1377/ 2140) 
i have a ten cents store theater or i have forgotten a couple of other jobs and when we are on the way uh i do not know five five or maybe six or seven years old he had been especially told that he was about to go up there i know all so one day the gun will gave him i do not know a quarter 

Recording: (1378/ 2140) 
so 

Recording: (1379/ 2140) 
uh well the problem is is uh like say every airline wants to go to new york city and they want all their businessmen there at a m well an airport has so many runways and so many tax you ways and you know like say ten airplanes every ten minutes can come in and out of those airport well they end up shooting like thirty there so instead of letting them all get in the air and stay up there on hold while they are you know shooting them in what they do is that 

Recording: (1380/ 2140) 
um all of them the university is divided up in different areas and there is this shop within each area that takes care of all the maintenance needs for those areas usually they are there are about twenty buildings or so ours is in the northeast area from <laugh> uh durby or so around in there and then on over to woodoff 

Recording: (1381/ 2140) 
oh yeah there is always people out there 

Recording: (1382/ 2140) 
um i i took a class for word processing word word processing one too i took those and um i tell you the truth i can not remember if they taught me how the balance of check book out 

Recording: (1383/ 2140) 
yeah i i saw it in the beginning i missed mary lake cafe so bad just had the good subs and all that i do not i do not know why i missed them i do not i go back and i just do not like it any more 

Recording: (1384/ 2140)

Recording: (1385/ 2140) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (1386/ 2140) 
just 

Recording: (1387/ 2140) 
there is very definitely 

Recording: (1388/ 2140) 
you know with the computer and everything um he is uh he is a really good handy man he can do anything so he is really helped me he he is really into design and stuff so he likes to paint and um you know he is really open he is learned a lot about gardening for me and you know that is one of my main things is gardening and umhum 

Recording: (1389/ 2140) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (1390/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1391/ 2140) 
umhum umhum 

Recording: (1392/ 2140) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (1393/ 2140) 
yeah <laugh> exactly so you know once you once you get to a certain degree of uh frustration and you need to relieve that somehow so that is pretty much why we moved 

Recording: (1394/ 2140) 
really 

Recording: (1395/ 2140) 
from our friends have gone yeah what is their discipline is explaining the child from school well they are explaining them to a home where the parents work working where they are just getting three days a free play i mean pretty much to get in trouble and cause them our trouble they really are learning from that 

Recording: (1396/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (1397/ 2140) 
well yeah i think it is real important to really get a good uh feel for how you are and all your beliefs and all that they have to really match and uh and if they do not um then it is not ever going to work because there is always going to be conflict in friction and all that kind of thing so i think it is real important and there is no age limit on that to when you really feel good about yourself when you really know what you want to do then that is the only time that you can really commit and say yeah we 

Recording: (1398/ 2140) 
yeah i think basically normal hours would be like eight to twelve and then you go home during lunch times that is a big meal a day you go home and eat with your family that is really important 

Recording: (1399/ 2140) 
on sunday 

Recording: (1400/ 2140) 
i do not even i know they add so many beachies i mean and i know they add a good reputation you know for for like just just you know just having a great vacation time because nobody ever skied my from was really a terrible you know by the way it is bad you know that that people are people are rude everybody is up there it is just going oh you get it going to get it going to get it you know it is on long fly but it is well what the town i am 

Recording: (1401/ 2140) 
uh i think they lost they go to the state lost because they just out there renting and leaving and after a while got out of hand i 

Recording: (1402/ 2140) 
so that is probably the roof right that uh 

Recording: (1403/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1404/ 2140) 
she is very bright she is very she comes from an extremely dysfunctional family her uh parents divorced and she is about four her mother is in alcohol like her father said that he would take her with him and then after it comes to the mind so she is pretty much raised herself it it is a big it it is terrible thing as what she said to go through and she is made it very clear that she will not live with an alcoholic and that is helped straightening him out so and our feeling was never that the alcoholism or 

Recording: (1405/ 2140) 
so i think 

Recording: (1406/ 2140) 
oh 

Recording: (1407/ 2140) 
i think that basically that is that not shows a brief a point in their life where you know their their hours as far as going out and killing themselves but do you want to kill themselves slowly by drink in themselves of death or uh smoking you know whatever you know smoking uh per crack or whatever and uh they just living in the house i mean 

Recording: (1408/ 2140) 
um early mission halfway <laugh> 

Recording: (1409/ 2140)

Recording: (1410/ 2140) 
i need to work that many hours so that i need 

Recording: (1411/ 2140) 
and you did not have any violence and stuff like that i have never heard you know i am just using pot right now 

Recording: (1412/ 2140) 
much more widely used once you get into college uh but i mean as far as like the pot and just things like that i mean i can not see see any difference between 

Recording: (1413/ 2140) 
umhum it does 

Recording: (1414/ 2140) 
um probably for the most part i mean as long as they have a political background of some sort they can not see anything real difference i mean from the most part they have beable to do anything else than a guy can do so 

Recording: (1415/ 2140) 
ah he is really rush uhhuh really but there is a lot of other people in there right 

Recording: (1416/ 2140) 
carly at all which i you know it is actually my family is business so um i started working there to help them out but you know as i am been working there for a while i have want to move up you know so 

Recording: (1417/ 2140) 
the herbsbs <laugh> the herbs 

Recording: (1418/ 2140) 
i do not think we take up huge amount and then uh we get some of the service through or not as well which is i think it is just up late up in the they give us the door and any name in the lot 

Recording: (1419/ 2140) 
um sort of let them make their own decision when they got older what they wanted to do whether they wanted to go with it 

Recording: (1420/ 2140) 
you know 

Recording: (1421/ 2140) 
but he is also like i said he is got five kids they live in low income housing they are collecting welfare 

Recording: (1422/ 2140) 
when i threatened to take them to court and they took almost two months after that 

Recording: (1423/ 2140) 
because now they are getting to the age where they are fighting more and you know and you have got a boy and a girl and you know it is 

Recording: (1424/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1425/ 2140) 
but then uh it is like that some evil person back there in the screening room put some of this junk in there right in the middle and then you go you can not stop and not watch that and if i was in church i would i would catch some of it out it is not that important 

Recording: (1426/ 2140) 
it was not so much of a hate thing it was just more these are the people i like to hang out with if you do not like that it is fine 

Recording: (1427/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1428/ 2140) 
right and i think that you know i think that it is just because you know you do so because i know i had done studies and i took some of those classes and you just think about it that way and i think a lot of these people just you know they say the nurse said something to take everything for a fact and i thought that was kind of strange but i mean i think there is a lot of things that are probably positive enough about it that i would not want to do it for for a lot bile as long as i could 

Recording: (1429/ 2140) 
thirty nine 

Recording: (1430/ 2140) 
i said this will never work i am not interested to take it back and he said no no no just let us just work with it just work with it so i end up giving him for a higher forty four but it was just funny because i thought i thought they are never gonna get to where i have to be and we are not even gonna play this game back and forth

Recording: (1515/ 2140) 
does not that get back more or less to the thing about everybody being meat meat now and therefore they really do not so much care about where they came from and what they are and who they are 

Recording: (1516/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (1517/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1518/ 2140) 
really 

Recording: (1519/ 2140) 
ah yes it it is a catholic school environment so it will be interesting to see what evolve from the children is uh attention to the the roman catholic side of religion is compared to theed so 

Recording: (1520/ 2140) 
right and then they wonder why uh you know i do not know what is happened it is the other person who is changed you know and if you if you start changing your behavior you can usually get the kinds of changes i always figure if you treat people the way they will go the wrong thing if you if you give out what you want back you get it 

Recording: (1521/ 2140) 
or like i talked to this one guy who was he was in the navy seal and he did like a couple of tours in vietnam and he was he was talking about how he was he was drunk and he he was from alabama and now so i am trying to figure out where the model number is in like oh that will be talking for like fifteen minutes 

Recording: (1522/ 2140) 
i think that is great you know i think obviously there is always a down side and but i think that too many people abuse the system and you know unfortunately it is very hard when you know then it ruins it for the people who really do need it and but you know as long as they 

Recording: (1523/ 2140) 
like it is okay i mean it is like a country school which was always over ut i was always like you mean like my friends were always like the way because they used to have real long hair and so that was like uh they used to be like a big hippie or ever in like um that was i guess we heard kind of like being the odd people and in a small they in small midwestern far i mean the school is it is kind of odd i guess um um 

Recording: (1524/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (1525/ 2140) 
as you could yeah we were poor but we managed 

Recording: (1526/ 2140) 
you know people like that can not work when i was a kid your family took care of you they was not poor from there and stuff like this but you do not have family structured no more 

Recording: (1527/ 2140) 
when you think that our major resource is is our children in our off spring then we better not you know 

Recording: (1528/ 2140) 
since now right the bevelled across the street on the al avenue so um uh but but anyhow you know they could never understand you know you did not you never got a job with it you know why would you go to school and waste all that money i i even spent this money i ever spent it

Recording: (1530/ 2140)

Recording: (1531/ 2140) 
and if i was in the same situation i would be doing the same thing so 

Recording: (1532/ 2140) 
oh you yeah i know 

Recording: (1533/ 2140) 
appeals appeals 

Recording: (1534/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1535/ 2140) 
i remember when i was in high school and college and all this kind of thing but it was just like you know people just thought oh you are american you are here therefore you must have lots of extra money to throw around and you know they just sort of do not grasp the fact that you know you can not have made sacrifices to be there but i do think also in some you know i remember actually being in brigham young california with brad pennsylvania at lewis and you know they are on the trailer and everything else 

Recording: (1536/ 2140) 
oh we now run a degrigorian and uh that sort of thing back to your question i think you were asking our

Recording: (1543/ 2140) 
the uh technical assistance in policy end of it and hated it the other years were fine but those last three it work pretty bad uh 

Recording: (1544/ 2140) 
oh my gosh one of those that do not like you know falling down the trees <laugh>

Recording: (1547/ 2140) 
i am i am not built that way 

Recording: (1548/ 2140) 
well i do think access is too easy but it is sort of like anything else i think if laws were passed the people who are against it would be so you know just besides themselves but it would i do not know for how long but i think it would make the situation not with the shootings and things like that but i think it would make the just the gun situation probably much worse for a while because people would be you know doing illegal things to get guns and that 

Recording: (1549/ 2140) 
just they are that into being sure you are relaxed enough 

Recording: (1550/ 2140) 
but i do not see it as negatively affecting me i still get all this stuff done i need to get done 

Recording: (1551/ 2140) 
doing their seventh and doing the twelfth you can take them as many times as you need to take them but if you do not pass them all by the time you graduate you get this nifty little thing called an attendant certificate it is not a real diploma it is like okay i attended i did not learn anything but i was there 

Recording: (1552/ 2140) 
yeah um i cook one oh four during winter quarter

Recording: (1556/ 2140) 
well he he is two main uh main characters and he is cartoon for a willie in his old 

Recording: (1557/ 2140) 
no huh 

Recording: (1558/ 2140) 
oh sure 

Recording: (1559/ 2140) 
but it it teaching him discipline responsibility you can not do these things at this time you know i 

Recording: (1560/ 2140) 
no it was put on it was more black than white tages or might have been even but now it is more black than white definitely now because i would i i live in the neighborhood where it is not it is mostly black then white and that is where i have always lived my whole life 

Recording: (1561/ 2140) 
be is and um with she had kind of a hard time in high school she was uh break by a teacher in ninth grade when she first went into a school and from there it is just been a nightmare of what how that has affected her you know anything she goes through you blame it on that or you go back i could just say oh i wonder you know if she was like that because of this and you know so that is been a real struggle in high school i was i never really 

Recording: (1562/ 2140) 
i mean if i would have chosen to do that well that is my choice you and your husband it is like what are you making these things maybe not back specifically much just like general rules for good living in your church at the same one thing but realistically you think maybe something a little bit different but what do you mean about all that conflict oh 

Recording: (1563/ 2140) 
and you know people do not have big families like they used to you know so 

Recording: (1564/ 2140) 
uh three years something like that hard to remember <laugh> a long time ago 

Recording: (1565/ 2140) 
i 

Recording: (1566/ 2140) 
yeah yeah yeah 

Recording: (1567/ 2140) 
i never heard a thing about it all the time i was in the service 

Recording: (1568/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1569/ 2140) 
i it gets not a presidential issue canada issue as far as i am concerned but uh i am 

Recording: (1570/ 2140) 
so it is probably was not unexpected we just were not prepared for it i do not think you could be prepared for it 

Recording: (1571/ 2140) 
so but it has a really tough challenging jobs and yeah if i knew now what i knew then i could probably could be a millionaire with all the lawsuits of different yeah experiences um sexual harassmentment 

Recording: (1572/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (1573/ 2140) 
and they were in italy and europe and uh there was not the definite in the in vietnam that there was in europe i think that is part of it and of course the attitude of most of the gust that went to vietnam was a little bit different from the right probably as they consequence of or understanding of the the uh 

Recording: (1574/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (1575/ 2140) 
yeah i uh well and that was really um struggle you know a struggle for money and everything so i would take whatever would come along and when you work in secure jobs like that i mean i had a different job every year i mean a year would come up and i would say okay here we go you know they are either gonna down size or they gonna do something and they always so i was never really shocked and they did not panhandle or anything and i was never without a job and never had to i never missed um you know i would say 

Recording: (1576/ 2140) 
we took um or i took uh military ethnic of the philosophy of course and that was really interesting because even though in even in that high a working there is still certain contacts within the contact of war for instance if if we both know if we knowing they go into it as combat is and we are fighting for whatever cause but if we both are willingness going into it 

Recording: (1577/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1578/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1579/ 2140) 
they have the money behind them they have lawyers behind them so they can sue for an appeal 

Recording: (1580/ 2140)

Recording: (1584/ 2140) 
and that is what i am saying it toning for thin quite a bureaucracy when you get a church telling you that you need to ask for forgive this one what they would did i mean in the church inf came up where i went and buried my grandparents and went to all my life over the door the church as a picture of christian for climas with a missionaryary a pleased and all his men with his sore drawn a dead native american in his feet and three more at the side looking on in fear now 

Recording: (1585/ 2140)

kind of exciting because you know they get in on things that are really new and trying to master up the project i am working on now um just trying to find a way to to i to create data that describeses so the library is of course so the library is going to take this data and put it in their catalog and they would agree with their regular collection and we are doing a lot of with it yeah it is it is pretty it is a pretty neat project a lot of new things the uh job in the way give us opportunities to do things 

Recording: (1588/ 2140) 
and decided to pursue the matter to the extent of marriage so that is where they meant no huhuh i i come down here two or three times like you know just trips through going to the airport and other miscellaneous things but um when i moved to the city i mean it it was a real big change because i you know used to living in the country and then i am moving to smackab and the middle of the downtown area 

Recording: (1589/ 2140) 
oh really <laugh> that is cute <laugh> 

Recording: (1590/ 2140) 
uh 

Recording: (1591/ 2140) 
see i do not shut up so i would talk to them the whole time and so they would always be really fairable and so it would seem like they had a much better understanding and could do things better than they really could like when my daughter was about five weeks out of hamster you know i said well you know you make sure you give up food and water and when it died and i was so surprised that she she had not even been giving him food and water because she did it occasionally but to a five year old you know yeah they do not get that stuff together our wind she was eleven weeks older 

Recording: (1592/ 2140) 
that is fine okay 

Recording: (1593/ 2140) 
letterly instinct you know and they are like oh very nice you should have one and you know and he knows on the cut up one um i just knew at a young age i have always loved the animal 

Recording: (1594/ 2140) 
uh yeah so i think she is getting a better education than he did but that is because she is doing the work and she knows she is expected to and just doing he my son is the kind he would rather play than work and so he he wrote a lot and 

Recording: (1595/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1596/ 2140) 
this is a different time now uh i mean i remember uh one of the things they saw when i was a kid on a newscast you know was uh uh the vietnamese game a big long guy getting the brings boat out on national tv you know and uh uh they did not make me go out and wanna do that you know so but anyway and they new ones not wanted to you know because my brother was in was in vietnam on the news in the army 

Recording: (1597/ 2140) 
much in school was that

Recording: (1599/ 2140) 
that is it oh 

Recording: (1600/ 2140) 
the six normal kids because ld kids would be creative and they would think of ways to get out of there and the normal kids would sit and cry 

Recording: (1601/ 2140) 
so i ended up doing that for about three months and ended up plunking out of uh ou in the in the first three months the first quarter so uh than i got my notice in january so 

Recording: (1602/ 2140) 
you do not slide as much 

Recording: (1603/ 2140) 
jies of cowboy and he was an indian 

Recording: (1604/ 2140) 
now that does make an extra work for the teacher but it gives him a shot he usually will answer the concept he will usually answer the and stuff that he knows and if you only grade him on that he might have a shot at a sierra be i mean there is all kind of ways to modify uh give a you do to work them out uh give a kid a copy of another student is no it is if his or crummy any they can not study from them we even have a thing in our school that it is 

Recording: (1605/ 2140)

Recording: (1607/ 2140) 
for example so you should name her camera 

Recording: (1608/ 2140)

Recording: (1609/ 2140) 
i do not know what it is like to grow up in anywhere else i i know what it is like uh kind of like where my cousin lived in new york because i would go there in the sun um did i like growing up in columbus uh how do you judge that you know what do you compare that to 

Recording: (1610/ 2140)

Recording: (1620/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1621/ 2140) 
yeah i guess they do i do not know what right where where it is or how many they have 

Recording: (1622/ 2140) 
yeah they are going to most likely raise it up to twenty one since all these uh they kentucky and maryland color broadado all their school shootings and can not believe in i mean there is articles in there you would not even believe if you have not read them 

Recording: (1623/ 2140) 
that is the way you need a car you can not just say hey we have got it she took it out here so we can screwing that is the problem and your saying does it does it does it take home does it take church it takes moreals and that is why i was telling me before it we got away from the world is in our society we could care less about you always uh a good successful salesman will be able to sell his own mother i mean still is one other one in on the market 

Recording: (1624/ 2140) 
you know 

Recording: (1625/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1626/ 2140) 
i do not have a good opinion of uh columbus schools at all no not at all 

Recording: (1627/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1628/ 2140)

Recording: (1629/ 2140) 
of the puzzle that that helps i think matthew shepherd helped also 

Recording: (1630/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1631/ 2140) 
because the problem with guns in my opinion is you do not have to think to use it it takes you know you do not have to sit there and load it and in a split second i think we all are capable of shooting somebody for whatever reason you know just dependingity or what not just in a split second you know we we might have that once in life but we can kill somebody that quickly and you can not go oh you know 

Recording: (1632/ 2140) 
i retire uh i like the movie like the mount stillings or something like that 

Recording: (1633/ 2140) 
should be tried and hopefully convicted on the facts and should not have anything else added into it i i think doing that is going to do the same thing that uh many the uh the gaves like they turn people against uh the busting action programs and the busing did that people is going to turn people against uh thegays like they turn people against black backs for a while although ultimately i think it did make a difference i i had a i have a black friend at the ohio education association who was very active in the sixties 

Recording: (1634/ 2140) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (1635/ 2140) 
yeah probably have to get it double in there you know worthings and somewhere around there to find couple million years but uh 

Recording: (1636/ 2140) 
you know 

Recording: (1637/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1638/ 2140) 
it is just major thing that you have to do that are a lot more time consuming 

Recording: (1639/ 2140)

Recording: (1640/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1641/ 2140)

Recording: (1643/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1644/ 2140) 
it is an island put it planet together i liked it there i kind of like i i figure they will probably hook up but i do not like how the show this show and this happened with deep space ninety two and even with next generation for a little bit how the shows become soap opera like um i mean the romantic aspect of the stories do not really appe to me very much um we are interested in the social things and you know good old special effects um but uh <laugh> 

Recording: (1645/ 2140) 
oh that is right 

Recording: (1646/ 2140) 
but she was never interested in i am never really interested in boys or in sports in high school or make up clothes and things like that and you know you are setting youself up for ridiculous high school for that and then so then she would come home and tear us because kids made fun of her and stuff and finally she just stopped going and within a couple months she she out of your ged 

Recording: (1647/ 2140)

Recording: (1649/ 2140) 
gun somewhere else 

Recording: (1650/ 2140) 
nope 

Recording: (1651/ 2140) 
to i you know to art whatever it is wherever it comes from and there is not that you know there is not the the old boy network you know not not as much who you know to get into things uh or or that women are allowed to know the people that the boys know so it is not it is not as closed off that way 

Recording: (1652/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (1653/ 2140) 
it was it was especially it was my job but you know the parents always get stuck 

Recording: (1654/ 2140)

Recording: (1661/ 2140) 
okay so yes in my opinion definitely it is eroding i know you are talking a little different approach in answering a question uh from over the time that that this kind of thing is eroding in the base upon the word respect it not ever been in the fall so uh i was not any kind of course you know i have not gone to the line yet not i have my phone would not want to be able to do that they need to be over there or they need know the wine in my car is not going to hold them over the back yard now hum how come is the weather on the news oh well i do not want to give you any that but anyway it if i told them they could not do it i would try it that is weird going to write my background and i know that uh i would try it very very far i got twelve months and i got a girl i had a girl and i am sure going to be a little more of my little girl and then anyway and i am doing college you and you can not catch me doing something they would come to the snow you cannot do i would apologize these mommy ones back along and i got just a mouth on the<laugh> well it is not going to be ever going to be on the bus now i mean now i am going to bewell the bus i do not know the cherry fire and apple wowas umhum yeah well the other men were <laugh> <laugh>

Recording: (1665/ 2140) 
berman came alabama 

Recording: (1666/ 2140) 
um so i am sure that probably increases the rate of public schools for them 

Recording: (1667/ 2140) 
because i guess it all came together because i do not understand how people can let their kids be heard but 

Recording: (1668/ 2140) 
no 

Recording: (1669/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1670/ 2140)

Recording: (1672/ 2140) 
oh yeah yeah we all get together we have to get a shelter house now somewhere because then nobody is house is big enough well and then we have so many little kids that it is great because uh we you just go to a shoulder inside and they have it you know like for christmas and things like that and they can run around the kids run around and 

Recording: (1673/ 2140) 
umhum umhum but i do not know that that i think the divorce rate has gone up because it is more socially acceptable i am sure there is plenty of people twenty years ago that would have loved to have got a divorce had that been an option um i i think it just i think a lot of it just depends on the way you handle it you know how you how you handle it after after though the divorce is fine i mean i do you see them it does not make any sense at all 

Recording: (1674/ 2140) 
um i mean obviously it is something that happens every day and things like that um it is like i said by no means in my saying yeah go president clinton or anything like that but uh i mean i can not say it hold it against him for doing something like that i mean it is something that threaten the nation or whatever 

Recording: (1675/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (1676/ 2140)

yeah well um people people do not have the priorities that they should you know what did you do you work all your life and you make a lot of money and then you die what did you you know did you learn anything did you teach anyone did you have an opinion about anything you know i mean that to me if you do not have time then you know you are just floating along kind of <laugh> taking up space now <laugh> 

Recording: (1720/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1721/ 2140) 
yeah yeah say it is going to be hard to do in some of the other states but i do not think so

Recording: (1726/ 2140) 
and he is real because people give him that 

Recording: (1727/ 2140) 
i think more what they need to do is restrict or uh just make stiffer penalties to people that carry the guns or that are involved buburb shootings and things like that um because i mean in the most part i mean people really do not get too badly punished for things i mean if you look at other countries i mean like people like the asian countries places like that i mean they have really strict laws i mean if you even get caught for like 

Recording: (1728/ 2140) 
you know because that was what did he have to write and then like the fact that he did not know like i think on international policy he will be struggling if he becomes president he did not know that three liters of the world thing and then on top of it like texas is a fairly big economy but still they to manage the entire you know in entire economy

Recording: (1734/ 2140) 
it trade that but yeah my my one sister that is uh exactly seven years older than me we are the closest and then the sister that is two years older than me she is the same way she does a lot of things that i am like why are you doing that you know they will do that so and she she pretty much stays low and depressed a lot to have everything she goes through but

Recording: (1737/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1738/ 2140) 
then they right even move on again you just do not get as close to people as you used to 

Recording: (1739/ 2140)

Recording: (1752/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (1753/ 2140) 
where they are almost aggravating themselves by having these organizations because they are geared specifically towards black people and i think in the way that some of the everybody from the rest of the community because they are not given out equal opportunity to people that need them um it is sort of like the same thing white people are doing you know thirty forty years ago where that they had their white organizations or whatnot um and i think it is sort of going along the same lines 

Recording: (1754/ 2140) 
that would be neat that would be real neat <laugh> but that is gee more else so 

Recording: (1755/ 2140) 
you can not especially with kids just to overwhelming 

Recording: (1756/ 2140)

i do not know uh maybe it i think if teachers just their status in society is not real high when it should be um that is more like i mean i have heard that like garbage men get paid more than teachers you know and how but it um so it is just like people always talk about you know education for that you know we have got like think about our child is future or whatever but really teachers are paid crap and like do not really get a lot of respect from anybody like professors and stuff 

Recording: (1758/ 2140) 
yeah if they want if they you know choose i am i am sure there is you know one of that are less men that have been with men also you know they have been with the men and then they have been with the woman now now they have got a girl friend so obviously you know and i feel like that looks because if they got a attraction towards the women so now they think they are a let man i do not see i do not that is why i think so i do not think that but if that is their choice that is their choice so i do think they could change <laugh> <laugh> 

Recording: (1759/ 2140) 
um i would say it does not really matter either way honestly i mean in fact the matters they are so deal with it i mean get over it i mean

Recording: (2076/ 2140) 
right right 

Recording: (2077/ 2140) 
well i thought about that you know i mean doing something in the anywhere uh even as a vet assistant but um with domestic animals um 

Recording: (2078/ 2140)

Recording: (2086/ 2140) 
everybody is living longer everybody is uh there is more medical things where people get uh can be heeled from things that they could not be heel from uh so everybody today is i mean uh basically as today as our future were back thirty years ago i mean when i was a kid you know i mean i was not really thinking about the idea i mean you know i was gonna about tomorrow 

Recording: (2087/ 2140) 
that is a thing but the thing is some people some people say some people say well why did you do this the thing is why do not you talk to this thing and say hey why not do do i am doing best in other words to implement the team 

Recording: (2088/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (2089/ 2140) 
um i think it is probably some of both i think it is probably more social but i mean obviously they are going to have different views on how things work um but i mean for the most part i can not see that as being too big of a problem um obviously there are more like violent guys out there and things like that than there are women but at the same time i would not say there is anything too over 

Recording: (2090/ 2140) 
i know i i never i never looked into that but that is a good suggestion uh like spanish instructors now in i never thought about that not until you just uh just just said so yeah or like teaching english as a second language i know they teach those classes so i was thinking well you know maybe i should start looking into like teaching classes but i was like well i did not know that was like true or not they can actually teach around

i mean my my kids went to a school that uh when my son was already left to but in the fourth grade they then they took all the kids in the other direction and said we are closing next year and it was hard but you know once it is reached the point that decision is made and announced and and there were good reasons for it uh and they explain the reasons and you know at some point you have you have to figure out how much do you want to fight something 

Recording: (2093/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (2094/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (2095/ 2140) 
um i think i think through education that is it is just going to only help kids because a lot of times maybe they do not get that at home so they are really looking to choose the right thing to do 

Recording: (2096/ 2140) 
a lot of exciting stuff going on up for the uproaries it is not not the old you know little lady in the band yeah yeah and the web has really changed that

i do not even read it much and it is very conservative very republican yeah 

Recording: (2101/ 2140) 
so you know and uh i was just brought up to being an honest person and um unfortunately there is a lot of people out there that you know so they sell out their ideas and their principals for forty thousand dollars a year and then they use their family or their situation financially it is used to so uh deals out uh i am not that kind of person that i will not ever be um so if that means that i stay monetary poor
