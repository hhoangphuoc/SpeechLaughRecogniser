Recording: (124/ 2140) 
oh there always has been there always has been i think a lot of people feel that kids a lot of kids are on medication today that should not be but um i think that is the fault of the school or the parents or some doctor that like for example when we refer kids in worthington to a doctor we have a list of three doctors that we work with and we know that they will not just give this kid a pill if he does not have eight out of the twelve symptems or

Recording: (137/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (138/ 2140) 
deep space nine in that uh they address the issue of different people living an working togr different people of different i mean these were alians rather than different ethnic denominations of humans but it it approach that from a less um uh from a more realistic standpoint and instead of having you kw like an old star trck you know everyone gets along then we come 

Recording: (139/ 2140) 
um originally north side 

Recording: (140/ 2140)

Recording: (142/ 2140) 
gage store to um buy a swimpsuit my sothemor yeare and he was the casheer there 

Recording: (143/ 2140) 
inadequate but he that was even through nursing school i mean those were not things that were discussed you got tof special conferences to get information on that 

Recording: (144/ 2140) 
rigt 

Recording: (145/ 2140) 
um-hum yeah 

Recording: (146/ 2140) 
uh 

Recording: (147/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (148/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (149/ 2140) 
yeah i like that 

Recording: (150/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (151/ 2140) 
yeah but i have got more influence i think maybe i am not sure i am hoping i have got more influence over him than his father does 

Recording: (152/ 2140) 
yeah i mean i want to see how the season ends out it is just a lot of the ones this season to me i have just been disappointing the i mean i think every show sort of has a peak some shows peak towards the end some at the beginning and sort of level off i meanth the simpsons had a stretch from like their third year through like their seventh where things were just like unbelievably funny and then they had some wridting changes i think and this this season it is just 

Recording: (153/ 2140) 
and we started talking again and it was just like we had not missed anytime and started dating 

Recording: (154/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (155/ 2140) 
whereas i do not know loothern is a little bit more open to 

Recording: (156/ 2140) 
so we have really never had a lot of use for the union but recently we just figured out that you know if they decide to strike we have no choice too and you can not work because they will take all the money you make crossing that line so you cannot work anybody that came back to work we ill lose all the money that they make they will take them to court and they will yeah i against yeah it is against the union contract so you had o 

Recording: (157/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (158/ 2140) 
i think that i do not think that divorce is a bad thing i think that i it is if you are married and you realize that you get to a point where you and this other person are are not in a positive relationship for each other whore for anybody else in your family that it is better to just say look this is not working we both deserve to be happy and we and and and go your own separate ways um i 

Recording: (159/ 2140) 
it kind of yeah well i have seen worser o um so im and they are doing this i think it is called sit angd reach where he is got to sit on the floor and he is got to raise his feet up just so and and he is got to take his hands and reach towards his tos and he they do that for you know lake five minutes the first time and they increase it and he really hates it 

Recording: (160/ 2140) 
but then that hurts the the the administrators in e sense that they were there to provide an education so it would be rough and like my high school they they put up cameras and they had like they locked bathrooms like at certain times you could not go in them and like it was getting and they had like we are on the front page of the accrammucan journal because they had a lock down where no one was alloued to leave their classroom and then they brought the the dogs through and they found i 

Recording: (161/ 2140) 
you can not you can not be matted somebody for choosing a live style you just can not life is too short you know i mean you can love them either way it does not make any difference 

Recording: (162/ 2140) 
that is why it is mainly appealing to inestate people you they pay you to go to school

Recording: (228/ 2140) 
well unfortunately i do not think it is fair but i think in the long run it does not have to be a college education because most of those people probably would not want a college education um but like a trade or a skill or something that will give them a little bit of hope if they do want to choose to get a job instead of robaby in a bank or selling drugs or whatever they did they have that choice it is it is it is up in their head okay i can either go become a welder or

um sector and i think that is a good signe but i think there is a huge there is millions of children that do not have any health care and that is not right there is like there is a lot of like between the lower and the upper there is a huge disparity but at least it is a step in the rght directond we have a a nice solid middlei middle in middle income base i think because a lot of countries only have the like i visited mexico andt seems like they only hade the distinction between the upper and lower i mean their middle class is very small and that i

because then you know what if something major happens that fourth time then what but i think a at least for children especially because they have no means to to help themselves and like the parents obviously even if they are working a lot of times can not get health care for their children so i think at least for children b how many accidents happen to children like peple aways breaking arms and stuff 

Recording: (253/ 2140) 
saying that they wanted to save this nice white girl because i had so much potential and i they were not going tao let me throw my life away like this hen i was you know a basar and so i was always from that time ond i decided these these people are all crazy i ame never going to i am never going to be like that and so i have a whole lot of different values from my family and it is real hard for them because all my other cibblings who are younger are willing to

Recording: (322/ 2140) 
um have those appossls and to have the the church set up like it was and it must have been really strong because it still lasted all the same catholic and or all the orthodox churches still carried all these beliefs

really and it is a fun job it really is i i have only never known one maile that taught first grade nd i knew one guy that taught third most of the time if they go into elementary ad they go for the upper grades like fouro five or six but um i really think that if we let the boys be more exposed to men earlier than they would be more motivated to learn because they would see that it is not just a girly thing 

Recording: (329/ 2140) 
 

Recording: (330/ 2140) 
ye 

Recording: (331/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (332/ 2140) 
if it were possible i think that a lot of parents are trying to raise them what they think is the best right now and that is another problem it seems like the way the financial world has come up and everything else the way the cost of living has increased it almost takes two parents in that home if you want to really live a half way decent life and be able to do some of the extra things no one wants to live and only have to be able to disuse like you said it wallk the necessities

i think it was a a nice thing about what we had uh we had uh grandparents that were not necessarily they were out of state in some cases we did not see them that much we made a part that uh we communicated with the grandparents regularly and when we did it was a special timeuh we uh emphasize the fact that uh uh you know the kids wanted to do certain things okay they saw their mother go out and maybe do some aditional things to 

Recording: (409/ 2140) 
um-hum

Recording: (416/ 2140) 
t home we interact the school is great you have people that are on the clock w trimeg to quit they are gone those people do not know the meaning of life they will never know the meaning of life but if they stay around try to extend themselves a little more with somebody that is having problems at work and are willing to work with that person i say willing to work not knowing they are going to be compensated because hey will be compensated

Recording: (425/ 2140) 
well it is like the i 

Recording: (426/ 2140) 
this just can not go on no think they are gong to stop it totally

Recording: (438/ 2140) 
okay that is good 

Recording: (439/ 2140) 
what we should buy yeah the retal what we should buy and that is the problem we listen to business too much if business reemphasized their gols to help society o and not themselves 

Recording: (440/ 2140) 
and i think um ofof course we all hope that debortion would not be that that nobody would have an abbortion that would be the perfect world because nobody would ever be in a situation where they would need one um but i also think you know imea i mean yeah there should not be there sould not should not spend six weeks on abortion or six weeks on what to do if you are pregnant um but but i think the subject has to be mentioned just just in passing 

Recording: (441/ 2140) 
i think for the most part people could handle it um obviously i think probably more the older generations would be the ones that would have the bigger problem with it the ones that grew up like during the whole black rigtes moviments and things like that um i could see them having a problem with it but i meann more like more of the generations of today or whatever like basically any one under the age of about forty or fifty or so i think that they could probably deal with it i mean i do not think it 

Recording: (442/ 2140)

Recording: (485/ 2140) 
short uh sa for for a test and um but the way that i would grade those would be pretty cientific i think you know i would come up with a rubric and i would say you you need to have you need to mention certain things and i will give certain points for herr mentioning certain things yeah i have i have never been a i have never been a teacher wre who is had to assigne or grade creative writing iam not sure i would t know how to do that yea 

Recording: (486/ 2140) 
you know talked to her but ur people do not when i was fourteen i did not care what anybody told me i was going to do it no matter what 

Recording: (487/ 2140) 
yeah i think i got i really good um i haveactuallyhve ben sitting thinking about it like what departments in the school were good and which ones were not um the foreign language is really good they have amersion classes from like second level 

Recording: (488/ 2140) 
i will raise them the best way i can 

Recording: (489/ 2140) 
uh it counts if you are touching the ground or if something that you are sitting on is touching 

Recording: (490/ 2140) 
um actually i was over there when all of that happened but of course it was all over the papers and you know i think i mean i i do not know what it was like really here i can imagine but i mean there especially they really focused on um not colembine but the one with the the younger kids in arkansas was it the year before i was there for both of those but you know in the first one you know they they put the picture of the little kid in comback gere holding the gun everywhere 

Recording: (491/ 2140) 
let us watch seven at night 

Recording: (492/ 2140) 
yeah it was real fun real fun i discreetly got him kicked out of the dorm he still does not kow wha it was me but yeah he still does not know it was me but he and i are still in speaking terms which is which is fascinating um but uh you know i mean our first day i walked in he said hey i am tom you ever smoked pop before sounds like no ou we got a whole year together and and i am directly quoting that is the first thing he said to me that as the first thing 

Recording: (493/ 2140)

Recording: (494/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (495/ 2140) 
i hope so yeah 

Recording: (496/ 2140) 
and so i think it gets driven home i think the media does that in a lot of places they pick something that is sensational and keep they are making it even more sensational like when uh uh jon kennedy died 

Recording: (497/ 2140) 
it is really beautiful out there we like we like mountains and you know walking around uh we got married in lake taho which is really beautiful 

Recording: (498/ 2140) 
m 

Recording: (499/ 2140) 
um 

Recording: (500/ 2140) 
he is a picky eater which she eads yep he he does not like everything 

Recording: (501/ 2140) 
like it is everything pretty i mean like basic stuff that you it would be u like a you know like a laserus or something like that you know ori or a bunch o seretimplaces you know like electronics uh appliances uh uh 

Recording: (502/ 2140) 
if there were any germans in there i will bet they e scared 

Recording: (503/ 2140) 
and i would just hear things 

Recording: (504/ 2140) 
um-hum me too 

Recording: (505/ 2140) 
um i am a loithern and a lot of what he says about everyone going to hell 

Recording: (506/ 2140) 
as back intointo high school 

Recording: (507/ 2140) 
um neither one of them is married or has kids uh my sister does hav boy friend for probably like three years or so and theres talk about them like marriage and kids and stuff like that with them 

Recording: (508/ 2140) 
well you know thatis a crime you can not really stop and other things that happen just you know too much partying around i mean that is why i left twelth avenue because i could not you know but you know just everybod u the neighbors being allowed and everything my mom is older so she can not really put up with any of that and 

Recording: (509/ 2140) 
like i am not i am not really sure like how they how the interview works to become a teacher um i am do not know i think it is like a lot of times they are really desperate to find people and so they really just take whoever i mean they are lucky enough to even have a body to fill the thi place and they are doing well enough i mean the kids are learningte material i mean sort of i mean i mean it is working well enough i guess 

Recording: (510/ 2140) 
north 

Recording: (511/ 2140) 
owe that goes with the disorder they know they know when who is butten to push and when not to push ya button and how far they can go and you know where the line is and they push you always that is why teachers they uh they drive the teacher up the wall 

Recording: (512/ 2140) 
i think society us toda up today is less tolerant of uh a lot of things that they see where people getting buy with stuff you know and theye are more vocal about it as opposed to being buyon it but back in the sixties and stuff you know uh not here but you know down south there are people still getting hung and stuff you know for being a black or something and uh you know there are bad blacks wand thereis bad wate too you know so but 

Recording: (513/ 2140) 
e 

Recording: (514/ 2140) 
 

Recording: (515/ 2140) 
you know so you can use all those opportunities to show your kid what not to do 

Recording: (516/ 2140) 
ell i mean to me the whole thing is wrong regardless of if you are guilty or innocent theyre to me there is wor t worse things i would think than than dying you know o you like i know in isral the guy who killed yisacrubin he got locked up and he is not allowed to see it because um under jewish law you can not kill 

Recording: (517/ 2140) 
and now it is our turn to deal with the issues we see our parents we see this generation all these things that are still popular it that we do not look down on the sixty i mean i think the sixtys son like a pretty fun time to live i will get into politics in a second um but those things are popularized but no we can not do it anymore because we havegot all tese problems 

Recording: (518/ 2140) 
because the would not let them when i was there 

Recording: (519/ 2140)

Recording: (523/ 2140) 
um 

Recording: (524/ 2140) 
uh i i think i like that how it is kept with a sort of a tension and it is not like you know i mean they are not completely thrown together like uh bilona and tom which i do not like that at all 

Recording: (525/ 2140) 
and he could not have any kind of cafine other ways he would get the shakes and he took all kinds of pills

Recording: (531/ 2140) 
wow 

Recording: (532/ 2140) 
the problem is lack of commitmenthe lack of commitment and not saying hey there is a nitch for you you can not be a maile well yeah you wan to do the operation i can not be yea yo want well why not be happy what you are god made you what you are why not make you the complete person you are and not strive for something you can not be

Recording: (542/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (543/ 2140) 
i think there might be but i think most of them are a dying breed they are the older citizens um many in my generation uh they it is probably be because i am i am the early baby boom i am i am the first of the baby boom uh and that is when the woman is movements started and many men they are still have not always accepted that so there there might be a problem there but for the the the the generations even the later baby boom generations behind me when i talk to themand i talked to uh high school students or even young college students 

Recording: (544/ 2140) 
no no they did not um they did not pay for grading or preparing your classes or or researching anything so right but but still even though it was real a very much underpaid job i i liked it when i did it um i liked the introduction to the arts class because i had to develope my own corriculum for it iht they had a when they told me i i 

Recording: (545/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (546/ 2140) 
the beginning of the end yep um grop in upere arlingtonm not sorry yeah really those five miles make such a difference though like because i yeah because i live on campus

Recording: (550/ 2140) 
and so you hadt 

Recording: (551/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (552/ 2140) 
the direction it is being uor they are being pushed 

Recording: (553/ 2140) 
um they just got different beliefs she believes u i mean like one thing she believes all men will cheat 

Recording: (554/ 2140) 
yeah much too fast for me you know my 

Recording: (555/ 2140) 
but it is not going to work i mean they if you are around people i mean numberaone the are around their parents and their sibblings and that is socialization you go to church or to the library or wherever i mean you are around people and you are around children and they get to have socialization if you want to call it whatever and i think from everything that i have read and seen

Recording: (562/ 2140) 
well think a little bit safer idea than uh eliminating guns because you know there is always going to be weapons out there instead of eliminating the problem you know more centralized it make it a national law that you have to be a certain age give a certain time period for your background checks and whatever else kind of record finding they need make sure youre 

Recording: (563/ 2140) 
a comedor sixty four is they have heard of it but they really do not know what a brilliant system it was that it is in in it is initial stage and it just got boled over because you know something better came out something better will come out than windows microsofft will eventually go under it wis just going to take a while oh yeah oh yeah i o not i give it probably about six or seven years before fore before somebody comes out with a system that is just as good as 

Recording: (564/ 2140) 
and just just shows the ignorance and so many people you know ind s it that really still bothers me there is there is uh still so much of that going on you know 

Recording: (565/ 2140) 
um 

Recording: (566/ 2140)

so but that is you know i ended up settling the attorney got most of the money what little i had i invested some and then i made some bad investments when i went off my medication and uh yeu knh blew it you know so that was my responsibility my fault but uh you know how it was just uh years of pend up frustration and i just 

Recording: (836/ 2140) 
um-hum yeah 

Recording: (837/ 2140) 
that is perfect 

Recording: (838/ 2140) 
yeah just one concert 

Recording: (839/ 2140) 
and i do not think that it its just executed properly so i would almost rather have it not at all 

Recording: (840/ 2140) 
h 

Recording: (841/ 2140) 
women really do not need ta sweat loge but it is there for them and they do participate um 

Recording: (842/ 2140) 
oh okay well the reason i asked was a it seems to me a lot of the impetice fo going to church or going back to church for people is when their kid gets old enough to go to sunday schoololol starting asking questions about religion and you are saying well i suppose i could answer all these but yeah 

Recording: (843/ 2140) 
um noenglish 

Recording: (844/ 2140) 
i do not think so 

Recording: (845/ 2140) 
um 

Recording: (846/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (847/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (848/ 2140) 
and part of it was just being stupid but it was down around mount vernon area and uh ey got very little money but i was not hurt 

Recording: (849/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (850/ 2140) 
i would say and then i would also say that you know uh because a a a number of reasons that people do not vote for school levies now is because the do not have kids in the schools you know but education is the foundation of a democracy and if you do not have an educated citizenry uh your democracy could go down the drain uh that was why tomas jefferson founded so many schools or you know the the university of virginia and believed in education you know because he said without an educated citizenry you will not understand the issues you know but 

Recording: (851/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (852/ 2140) 
 

Recording: (853/ 2140) 
hum 

Recording: (854/ 2140) 
groups and different cliks but i can not help but thinking that if it was bad enough that you would do something like that that you know had to have been more than just you know sort of normal jogks versus whatever so i think it should be more i do not know i mean even ou know i went to a private 

Recording: (855/ 2140) 
and you know you geo have a hard thing there but then if you teach the teachers that they are not going to be quiet and they are not going to you know um look at this flattery 

Recording: (856/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (857/ 2140) 
uhit 

Recording: (858/ 2140) 
hhuh 

Recording: (859/ 2140)

Recording: (863/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (864/ 2140) 
 

Recording: (865/ 2140)

Recording: (871/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (872/ 2140) 
you know so basically well yeah it might work but to me it is kind of stupid you know because what you are saying is we are going to take this law and we are really going to stick you on this law but to hell with all the other laws so is that really fair 

Recording: (873/ 2140) 
along it was ju back in the sixties so you know 

Recording: (874/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (875/ 2140)

Recording: (876/ 2140) 
i remember it being it is a pretty positive thing for me i was never upset about the fact that they were not together because they al both gave me a lot of attention but um about i think i was maybe five or six my mom moved into apartment in german village 

Recording: (877/ 2140) 
yeah my brother well he is the oldest oldest but two sisters pretty much all the ones i really care about two sisters and their husbands 

Recording: (878/ 2140) 
s more expensive so everyone has a lot less and here it is like everything is so relatively inexpensive that it is like you know picture frames or something there it might be you know twenty five dollars for one so you buy one here oh you know theye are five dollars a piece let us by five you know 

Recording: (879/ 2140) 
yep 

Recording: (880/ 2140) 
um-hum you are guided across the street you know forlin highway and you are siting the are going 

Recording: (881/ 2140) 
l around you but at night it is pretty fun and you just floor it and fly right through the midle of downtown um improvements i would just say kee i would just say the i mean this place is dirty 

Recording: (882/ 2140) 
yeah well and i think kiro practors will be more popular for the same type of reasonh yeah 

Recording: (883/ 2140) 
o 

Recording: (884/ 2140) 
as he was speaking and and as he started to speak i realized to another thing that i really feel has a tremendous inpression on how we as people are doing here but how the politicians are is because the world in essence is getting smaller because the communication has gotten better and all these other countries and us are just like all one country anymore or something and i think that is had a tremendous influence also on our politics and on we as tha people 

Recording: (885/ 2140) 
see tomorrow i mean hold them feel the warmpth of the body uh hear the conversation quietly rather than uh hearing okay time to get out of here uyou know with a vigarous thing but a pleasant sort of remark these kind i could elaborate i coulate rit awole book on that on this on a answer yourrs uh but it is these kinds of things are very elementary really they are very elementary i guess t 

Recording: (886/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (887/ 2140) 
right right he would go for weeks he would get mat me and thatwould speak to me when i was growing up for a week or two at a time my mother would say please nanc i changed my name when i went to college i just decided i am out of here i am everything is gone and so she would say um nancy please just talk to your father just for just for my sake please and i would think i am ta child here i should not have to be the one to make peace in this family if he does not want to talk to me i do not need him i do not have to talk to him 

Recording: (888/ 2140) 
well it is sort of like the sociology of like clicks you know like how how that develops like how people like some people seek to like fit in like i like tes that is a real strong uh like 

Recording: (889/ 2140) 
really yeah i do not feel old at all i mean i you know a lot of people think wew you should know what you want to do or you know and and i guess there is different fases like uh mazlo is hierarky what is that the um the higherarky of needs masle maslo anyway 

Recording: (890/ 2140) 
l not let him beat sop right now but 

Recording: (891/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (892/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (893/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (894/ 2140) 
well it was both really because there is kids lived there since i lived there and i was thirteen years ago and being that long in the same neighborhood just does not really get it with me 

Recording: (895/ 2140) 
yeah from the strike yeat yeah um actually a lot of our stuff did pretty well w we were off so did make you feel as needed as you wanted to bemab you know yeah you know we got a lot of our buildings up and runthin before they went on strike and i think the bosses knew this was coming so a lot of the air conditioning was already running by then 

Recording: (896/ 2140) 
yeah exactly i know 

Recording: (897/ 2140) 
yeah um-hum 

Recording: (898/ 2140) 
it is always been my feeling and and uh i try to be fair in the way i grade uh you know it is i try to be as ubjective as i can some times i i because i think it is important that people learn how to write i would ask all my classes to write an say or a short 

Recording: (899/ 2140) 
you know 

Recording: (900/ 2140) 
yes 

Recording: (901/ 2140) 
hat is pretty extreme 

Recording: (902/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (903/ 2140) 
oh gosh 

Recording: (904/ 2140) 
their idesd i mean the guys are trying to look older the girls are trying to look younger 

Recording: (905/ 2140) 
wriht then they had to after that they had ther lottery number and that was not if you were hot you know if you got your number was picked i mean i do ot knowhit it would be worse knowing that you were going to get a notice and being able to prepare for it or i uh because i have had friends that gotten uh numbers and everything you know and and getting a high number and sayting yo ere going ol mye god so 

Recording: (906/ 2140) 
um it was just yeah i guess the mafio was a big problem they just take over everything and they they do not pay their workers and most people are not mopious they do not get paid 

Recording: (907/ 2140) 
but i do know my my my brotherinlaw mentioned to his uh parents gosh what a sacrifice you guys did for us and he is just turnin fifty and they do not have any kids and he says ow how you did it well for one thing they prbably did a lot of sacrificing and when you sacrifice it becomes makes you more humble 

Recording: (908/ 2140) 
uh the younger kids would not think anything about it 

Recording: (909/ 2140) 
uh a type of life style and that life style is gone everybody is independent everybody is going their own ways and if you happen to be lucky enough to find somebody that is looking in the same direction you are and is equally as independent then it might it might work but um ih you know and who knows why each person gets divorced i mean each one of them was an individual situation and uh 

Recording: (910/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (911/ 2140) 
uh-huh fom the watch towers yeahyoure kind of like you know look it up and says you know savmybody s youknow got their sights on me yeah because that is i it is like you know like you know it that is like the wood ware too stuff you know there is like the remaines i am sure but it is lke f you get you see the wall it is like there i mean i am sure there is like that there h uh what from what i understand that it is lke 

Recording: (912/ 2140) 
u 

Recording: (913/ 2140) 
so how u this works out you know i do not know im just i am just like okay she just says i just want to get it over with and see now she you know 

Recording: (914/ 2140) 
oh really 

Recording: (915/ 2140) 
to be closeso i did not have to drive 

Recording: (916/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (917/ 2140) 
see that is great though 

Recording: (918/ 2140) 
um so i mean basically my opinion on that is just leave it up to them i mean if they want to take the risks obviously they know 

Recording: (919/ 2140) 
if you if y if if you say buy buy from those unscrupulous business people il say gee these guys gan not have credit what happens to that person that follows bankrupty u by bankrupty okay i will do something else gain th tht nex next time 

Recording: (920/ 2140) 
well i really think that is happening right now because i think that i do not know what the divorcestatistics have been recently but i do see that more people who are getting married are staying married because thorse that do not those that would have gotten a divorce they are not bothering to get married to begin with they are just living together and tt t they separate so what and i think that 

Recording: (921/ 2140) 
yeah and it it has the least amount of people which is kind of neat as far as trurism so 

Recording: (922/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (923/ 2140) 
i am looking for a parttime job as we speak i have been like doing temporary on and off u the thing with that is you can work you know for four or five months and then nothing and then like that so right now i am looking for something permanent 

Recording: (924/ 2140) 
you know just experiencing someone for who they are and so she is 

Recording: (925/ 2140) 
a couple of restaurants or something but i mean it is it is different when you think of other cities you know it is more of like a downtown is where you go to hang out but here it is like campus and we are more of ah 

Recording: (926/ 2140) 
it was just so i did not object to that one at all 

Recording: (927/ 2140) 
that that would be seriously fun but uh it depends if you work industry you get money 

Recording: (928/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (929/ 2140) 
really 

Recording: (930/ 2140) 
d they were just wild you know i just ran every minute and i took it as a substitute and did not know from day to day you know whether it is going to keep it i finally had to say i can not do this twenty seven kidner gars i am sorry i caul not do this by myf 

Recording: (931/ 2140) 
um me or 

Recording: (932/ 2140) 
yeah drugs right yeah yeah see that is what she is interested in right now she is looking to see if she can find some place to work this summer even f if it is just a day a week some clinic or something just to to see whatis goes on day to day 

Recording: (933/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (934/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (935/ 2140) 
uh it is bisiop redy it is atkuh you you are noffing around here it is a it is a it is a cassic scol over on the west side 

Recording: (936/ 2140) 
you know and i just told them wa hased to do with my belief system so yeu are in violation of the first amendment you know so and then they realized that i was not stupid so you know they just made things more and more difficult for me you know so i just decided to since they were not going nto change i was just going to leave you knw but so it is you know it is it is a hard way you choose to walk youknw if you are an idealistic person and is i mean just more s 

Recording: (937/ 2140) 
is it any worse than baseball cards or you know 

Recording: (938/ 2140) 
and yheu said divorce is more acceptable divorce should never be acceptable 

Recording: (939/ 2140) 
yeah i had a cousin that went on she she was in school for that and um as you could tell i like to do office work i 

Recording: (940/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (941/ 2140) 
yeah that is how he gets so much money he says i will be paid this much and i will be given this many this much minimum per day or i am not working for you and they usually say no n no we will not do that you know and then they will call back a weeklater okay we will take you he has some really good stories about that oh yeah he has qualivisionons of businesses and also with uh unixs which is 

Recording: (942/ 2140) 
um 

Recording: (943/ 2140) 
whole lot more places to live it seems like everywhere i turn there is construction and and you know you go down one road and then you wait a couplef years if you do not go in that area and it is all changed looks all different so and that is mainly like looking up bethol and three fifteen nore things like that 

Recording: (944/ 2140) 
you know he was in oh yep they both worked during college and i guess my dad was on the gi bill after the war so that is how he got in here and had to work some part time work to get his degree um-hum it is just east broadstreet just franklin park con 

Recording: (945/ 2140) 
i mean that goes along with my customs and beliefs i mean we are going to send our child i already know to parocrial schools there is no way i am going to send him to a public school and even my my husband is a um boy scout um leader and just listening to the boys there he he did a program last night on respect 

Recording: (946/ 2140) 
the ultimate would probably be a parttime thing you know but neither one of our positions offer any type of part time where we have some friends that do that where they only go two days a week or something which is they get a little bit of both the world so 

Recording: (947/ 2140) 
do i think they will oh yes i think they definitely will i think there is so much heavy uh political and financial i am min reverse that statement uh there is so much heavy financial influence up on the political uh influence that it it is almost a fourgone conclusion and if it does not occur this within this year and uh there may be another vote in another year or next a next election but i think that in fact it will go 

Recording: (948/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (949/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (950/ 2140) 
you know 

Recording: (951/ 2140) 
yeah that is what i wam saying 

Recording: (952/ 2140) 
yeah a uh yeah they they have had two different articles ind theire uh about it whelre they had a big article uh back when uh it was at jessy jackson was down there or something a couple of years ago or something and uh he made a concerted effort to try to let people know how pover up momuch poverty is down there andeverything but then you go to a lot of other extremes you know where you set ur these people would not want to live in collumba so 

Recording: (953/ 2140) 
i mean i think he is done some positive things that whole thing about um uhh as far as like your student loaans and being able to get into t as helped me you know and i think you know all this that as far as some of the issues go i think that that i feel pretty similar to the way he does um some of his foreign policy things i think i have gone pretty decently but i mean i think i do not i do not know i mean i i 

Recording: (954/ 2140) 
yeah from what i hear actually the like the emery and the um university of chicago you have to work really hard because they get all the kids who wish they would have gotten to harvord and then start you know tryg to make it up by working hard or you get to actual harvard nobody works because they are like we already made it you 

Recording: (955/ 2140) 
i uh well that is a that is a tough one uh i remember you know when we were we had you know some movies like that but they were like the bowery boys and stuff you know we are it was you prtty much knew it was alf pake anyway you know but and to me that is a pake and uh uh and i never e really thought about while i was growing up that it was what was real and everything uh i always knew that by i there again you know by my dad being 

Recording: (956/ 2140) 
he he is avery he is a discipline 

Recording: (957/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (958/ 2140) 
ple do this and we will do this so we checked out the catholic school and they were organized that way and it is just what is a better better match for him and then when my daughter went to school it was just easier to take thim to the same school you know and and that gomes back and remighd me of another thing i wanted to say about my either discipline and and behavior maybe different in the catholic school is you are paying big you are paying bucks you know it is fourt forty five hundred dollars a year for us to send her to school 

Recording: (959/ 2140) 
yeah i figure right now i might as well take advantage of it 

Recording: (960/ 2140) 
yes 

Recording: (961/ 2140) 
a businessman my dad and i have been screwing arond with stocks for years um i am been in contact with a um day trading firm down in west virginia and they are starting an intern program sometime i do not even know when but if the if that opens up i will probably seriously considered going down to west virginian they are in richmand west richmand yeah i have beensaying west virginia have not i they are in virginia sory theye they are home basis in um wrichmand virginia so 

Recording: (962/ 2140) 
a year and then i went into the aramy in nineteen forty spring of nineteen forty one before pol harber and it was in uh service for uh four and a half years in italy most of that time nor north africa an ten itally and uh a had met a a a girl before i went in to service and so 

Recording: (963/ 2140) 
tthen when i found out there ware so many openings in special ed so and then i found out later that speech theropy as a very good background for ld because a lot of these ld kids have language deficits and language problems they they can not you know like express themselves on paper where they do not process things correctly auditorially so that is the perfect background to work with ld kids i did not know i was doing that at the time but 

Recording: (964/ 2140) 
i made a difference 

Recording: (965/ 2140) 
that is great 

Recording: (966/ 2140) 
yes and noh uh when we ware in boy scouts we got kicked out of it 

Recording: (967/ 2140) 
and uh well she i the the people that own it are starting to build it up now but it is been like that it was the first department community uh in columbus it was built in thirty eight i guess 

Recording: (968/ 2140) 
um yeh people that live there i mean we have got the the you know the indian department stores right down there on high street and and couple of asian groceries but i you know i i i do not know where they live i mean it it seems it seems like for those stores to be opening there there must be somewhere in clintainville but i do not i do not know 

Recording: (969/ 2140) 
ohrigt 

Recording: (970/ 2140) 
u 

Recording: (971/ 2140) 
i do not know i i would not personally like think that the parents should be held responsible i mean they do have you know a certain amount of responsibility for the fact that they should have been more aware and and especially because i mean i believe that those at least one of the two had been in counseling in you know was doing i aggression management or something like that um you know you would think that if they were going through something like that you would just sort of you know maybe 

Recording: (972/ 2140) 
hhuh 

Recording: (973/ 2140) 
s once a turrist heare about it you know it is like younw 

Recording: (974/ 2140) 
um 

Recording: (975/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (976/ 2140) 
well basically it is the same thing here but some of your management is real good i have seen people that that you know are super but i have seen people that are bad the problem is you get a bad management and it can make your life heall i do not care who you are 

Recording: (977/ 2140) 
all you do is you just keep your records of of um you know what you spend on things and then there is a formufil out and how much you have if you have taken any depretiation you know you need to basically put that back in and deduct your cost and then there is the percentage that goes on to your schedule etheat goes in the front of your form that goes into your income and then it is just taxed it is just no it is really not that hard 

Recording: (978/ 2140) 
then 

Recording: (979/ 2140) 
um-hum yeah i am just learning the area so but i like it so far it seems really nice and uh r seems like there is a lot more to do in collumbus obviously but 

Recording: (980/ 2140) 
w o i think that is um 

Recording: (981/ 2140) 
everyone might experiment or try or make a mistake but the way he is handling it saying i am not even going to dignify that question over and over and over if he did not do it he might as well just be like no i did not do it 

Recording: (982/ 2140) 
downtown which is where this my one of my orchestras plays a lot and uh we sang in other different kinds of churches and said what we liked about and what we did not maybe it had some feetback i think the new building is accoustically very good it is certainly much better than n old worchip center because i do not know if you have seen a picture or anything of the church but the old worchip center was designed by a modern arkhitect 

Recording: (983/ 2140) 
um-hum at this point um i am not a uh i am not against the urban schools but if it was my own personal child i would move to a suburban area until collumbus gets their act together they are in so such bad shape right now that i do think the state will take over the collumbus public schools in two years yeah they have threatened it um and if they do not pull their scores up um they will you know 

Recording: (984/ 2140) 
and move on um that is that is basically my fear but uh as one of the guys tryied to help me he said well listen i am afraid of that too so because right there in that pit there that is got now if you remember that there is nothing in here that can hurt you even as hot as it gets you know and when you think about that you try not to think too much whyle you are in there although 

Recording: (985/ 2140) 
or they yeah they come back to visit me sometimes from the high school 

Recording: (986/ 2140) 
yeah it is ridiculous i mean plus it is a nationally recognize school so a degree from ohio state i mean you could go anywhere the nation someone is at least going to recognize tbecause t is a big it is a big big name ashland it would be more of a sell i would be like okay we it is small it is private it is credited but still 

Recording: (987/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (988/ 2140) 
t does not matter how much money they are given for their education they 

Recording: (989/ 2140) 
yeah i think mostly they did uh i was kind of surprised um which class was this in i think this was inh that ntroduction to the arts class i was kind of surprised that one of the students in my class thought it was very hard and i did not think it was that hard at all but she wrote me some kind of nasty not at the last class or before the last class that she had a straight ay average at this school before my class and i was giving her a be and she was her 

Recording: (990/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (991/ 2140) 
uh i do not know where he got tho contact but anyway he went up to boon iawa and joined a national gard out at uh which was fieled artilary and uh with the expectation of their being mobilized soven which they were and uh so he he was home one weekend and talked to me about i and i we all fieled artilary i was exposed to that when i was a in arotc at ams so i saw that is be better than carry him 

Recording: (992/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (993/ 2140)

Recording: (1107/ 2140) 
i mean i think they could try if theyre you there kids trying to push them away they should not you know let their kids push them away you know i guess you can not make your kid go out with you and do things 

Recording: (1108/ 2140) 
too much of a role model figure anymore um i mean obviously it should be someone that theyd respect but i can not say that they would be like oh well he does it so i am going to have to do it too or whatever

Recording: (1133/ 2140) 
we needed that

Recording: (1357/ 2140) 
well i agree that we should help them maybe through som sort of government program but i think what really hurts them the most is the people that actually give them the money on high street because it really does not motivate them to get out of the gutter i mean if they can make a living off of beging change off of college students they are probably going to stay with that because it is a really easy life 

Recording: (1358/ 2140) 
um-hum

Recording: (1371/ 2140) 
exactly huge 

Recording: (1372/ 2140) 
hm 

Recording: (1373/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1374/ 2140) 
h 

Recording: (1375/ 2140)

Recording: (1376/ 2140) 
and we would uh ujust the guns called down shifts ntill they could come within reasonable close to that

an a ten cent store theater i forget a couple o other shops and when horand was about i do not know v five or maybe six or seven years old he had been expressibly told that he was not to go up there at all so one day grandmoh gave him i do not know a quarter 

Recording: (1378/ 2140) 
so 

Recording: (1379/ 2140) 
uhwa the problem is is uh an like say every airline wants to go to new york city and they want all their businessmen there at eightam well an airport has so many runways and so many taxeways and you know like say ten airplanes every ten minutes can come in and out of those airports well they end up shooting like thirty there so instead of letting them all get in the air and staind up there and hold while there you know shooting them in what they do is they 

Recording: (1380/ 2140) 
um all of them the university is divided up ind different areas and there is a shop within each area that takes care of all the maintenance needs for thes areas usually they are about twenty buildings or so ours is in the north east area from wexner down through the ovel to well i do not know about uh dirby or so around in there and then on over to wooddruff 

Recording: (1381/ 2140) 
oh yeah there is always people out there 

Recording: (1382/ 2140) 
um i i took a class for war procing wr war processing one an too i took those and um i tell you truith i can not remember if they taught me how to balance a checkbook out 

Recording: (1383/ 2140)

Recording: (1384/ 2140)

Recording: (1385/ 2140) 
um 

Recording: (1386/ 2140) 
jus 

Recording: (1387/ 2140)

Recording: (1389/ 2140) 
yea 

Recording: (1390/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1391/ 2140) 
um-hum um-hum 

Recording: (1392/ 2140) 
uum 

Recording: (1393/ 2140) 
yeah exactly so you know once you once you get to a certain degree of uh frustration you need to relieve that somehow so that is pretty much why we moved 

Recording: (1394/ 2140) 
really 

Recording: (1395/ 2140) 
from our friends that have gone yeah withh their discipline as expelling the child from school well they are expelling them to a home where the parents working where they are just getting three days of free play i mean pretty much to get in trouble and cause more trouble they really are not learning from that 

Recording: (1396/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (1397/ 2140) 
well yeah i think it is real important to really good to get a good uh feel for how you are and all your beliefs and all that they have to really match and um and if they do not um then it is not ever going to work becusbecause there is always going to be conflict and friction and all that kind of thing so i think it is real important and there is no age limit on thatto when you really feel good about yourself and you really know what you want to do then that is the only time that you can really commit and say yeah we 

Recording: (1398/ 2140) 
yeah i think basically normal hours would be like eight to twelve and then you go home during lunch time because that is the big meal of the day you go home and eat with your family that is really important 

Recording: (1399/ 2140) 
onsunday 

Recording: (1400/ 2140) 
i have not knew i never new they had so many beaches i mean i i know that had a good reputation you know for for like just just just you know just having a great vacation time because nobody ever came back from roser oh yeah place was terrible you know wheather was bad you know that that people were people were red everybody i theyer woud say y say oh you get to goyou get to go you knt say you know it is a long flight but it is well worth the time 

Recording: (1401/ 2140) 
uh i think they losti think o or state losst because they was just out there renting and raving and after a while got out of hand an oh 

Recording: (1402/ 2140) 
ell that is probably the roof rit ther so 

Recording: (1403/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1404/ 2140) 
she is very bright she is very she comes from a extremely disfunctional family her uh parent is divorced when she is about four her mother is n alcoholic her father said that he would take her with him and then after he got divorced he changed his mind so she is pretty much raised herself an it is a big it it is terrible thing so but she is ad to go through and she is made it very clear that she will not live withn alcoholic and that is helped to straighten him out so and our feeling was never that the alcoholism or 

Recording: (1405/ 2140) 
so i think 

Recording: (1406/ 2140) 
oay 

Recording: (1407/ 2140) 
i think that basically that is itin a nutshow they reached a point in their life where you know the they are cowards as far as going out and killing themselves but they want to kill themselves slowly by drinking themselves to death ore uh smoking you know whatever you know smoking uh pcrack or whatever and uh eand just living in a hell i mean 

Recording: (1408/ 2140) 
um early admission pathway 

Recording: (1409/ 2140)

and you ded not have the violence and stuff like that i have never heard an you know i am just using pot right now 

Recording: (1412/ 2140) 
much more widely used once you get into college um but i mean as far as lke the pot and just things like that i mean i can not say i see any difference between 

Recording: (1413/ 2140) 
um-hum it does 

Recording: (1414/ 2140) 
um probably for the most part i mean as long as they have a political background of some sort i can not see i see any real difference i mean for the most part they have proven to be able to do anything else any guy can do so 

Recording: (1415/ 2140) 
always feally rushuhhuh reallywhy 

Recording: (1416/ 2140) 
hardly at all which i you know it is actually my family is business so um i started working there to help them out but you know as i hav been working there for a while i want to move up you know so 

Recording: (1417/ 2140) 
the erbs the herbs 

Recording: (1418/ 2140) 
i do not think we take up a huge amount and then uh we get some of the service through ornet as well which is i think it is just up lean avenou they give us the domain name and all that 

Recording: (1419/ 2140) 
um sort of likwo make their own decision when they got old er what they wanted to to do where they wanted to go with it 

Recording: (1420/ 2140) 
 

Recording: (1421/ 2140)

Recording: (1422/ 2140) 
when i threatened to take them to court and it took almost two months after that 

Recording: (1423/ 2140) 
because now they are getting to the age where they are fighting more and you know and you got a boy and a girl and you know it is 

Recording: (1424/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1425/ 2140) 
but then uh it is like a some eavil person back there in the screening room puts some of this junk in there right in the middle and then you go you can not stop and not watch that you know youcan and if i was in charge of it i would cut some of it out it is not that iportant 

Recording: (1426/ 2140) 
it was not so much of a hate thing it was just more these are the people i like to hang out with if you do not like that that is fine 

Recording: (1427/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1428/ 2140) 
igt and i think that you know i think that it is just because you know you do so because i know i have done studies and i tooke some of those classes and you just think about it that way and i think a lot of these people just you know they say the nurse hays helpt ing you take everything for a fact and i thought that was kind of strange but i mean i think there is a lot of things that are pobably positive enough about it that i would want to do it for for a while as long as i could 

Recording: (1429/ 2140) 
thirty nine 

Recording: (1430/ 2140)

well no actually my mom did not she was a very bad cook 

Recording: (1510/ 2140) 
yeah it was a home made bow and arro 

Recording: (1511/ 2140) 
the majority of the ones that do not get the guidens at home that you are trying to reach hing will go to boy scouts 

Recording: (1512/ 2140) 
right yeh 

Recording: (1513/ 2140) 
trying if yeuae eght children and if you are here in a this country and yo had eight children why do you have eight children to start with 

Recording: (1514/ 2140) 
yeah and and the problem is the problem is seeing things in other people i mean actually seeing spirits in other people in terms of someone said the yes are the maor to the sal at is very true you know i could see in certain people is eyes when i was in the hospital the confusion the unsure feelings 

Recording: (1515/ 2140) 
does not that get back more or less to the thing about everybody being me me me now and there fore they really do not so much care about where they came from and what they are and who they are 

Recording: (1516/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1517/ 2140) 
ih 

Recording: (1518/ 2140) 
really 

Recording: (1519/ 2140) 
wand it is uh yes it is it is a catholic school environment so it will be interesting to see what evolves from the children is uh attention to the the roman catholic side of religion as compared to the baptists so 

Recording: (1520/ 2140) 
right and then they wonder whyuh you know i do not know what is happened it is the other person who is changed you know and if you if you start changing your behavior you can usually get the kinds of changes i always figure if you treat people the way that will goldend rule thing if you if you give out what you want back you get it 

Recording: (1521/ 2140) 
or like i talked to this one guy he was he was a navy seal and he did like a a couple tours in viet nam and he was he was talking about how he was he was drunk and he ws he was from alabama he was like yeah i am about half drunk now so i am trying to figure out where this model number is and like we talked to him for like fifteen minutes 

Recording: (1522/ 2140) 
i think that is great you know i think obviously there is always a downside and but i think that too many people abuse the system and you know unfortunately it is very hard when you know then it ruins it for the people who really do need it and but you know as long as they 

Recording: (1523/ 2140) 
like it is okay i mean it is like a country school which was always real weird too i was always likei mean like my friends were always like the because iy used to have real long hair and so that was like i used to be like a big hippy or whatever and like um that was i guess weird kind of like being the od people and a ind a small like in a small midwestern farmeing school is kind of od i guess um on o um 

Recording: (1524/ 2140) 
umum 

Recording: (1525/ 2140) 
as much as she could you know we were poor but we managed 

Recording: (1526/ 2140) 
now people like that can not work when i was a kid your family took care of you there was not welfare and stuff like this but you do not have a family structure no more 

Recording: (1527/ 2140) 
when you think that our major resource is is our children and our offspring then we better not you know 

Recording: (1528/ 2140) 
cents an hour at the beverley across the street on nil avenue so um uh but but anyhow you know they could never understand you know you did not you never got a job with it you know why would you go to school and waste all that money i ware the best money i ever spent 

Recording: (1529/ 2140)

Recording: (1530/ 2140) 
nope humum 

Recording: (1531/ 2140) 
and if i was in the same situation i would be doing the same thing so 

Recording: (1532/ 2140) 
wow you yeah i know 

Recording: (1533/ 2140) 
appeals appeals 

Recording: (1534/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1535/ 2140) 
whole time wi we was in high school ind college and all this kind of thing but it was just like you know people just thought oh you are american you are here therefore you must have lots of extra money to throw around and you know they just sort of do not grasp the fact that you know you can have made sacrifices to be there but i do think also in films you know i remember ectually being in bristal and that film california with brad penjuli lewis and you know they are in the trailer and everything else 

Recording: (1536/ 2140) 
o we now are unother gregorian and uh that sort of thing but back to your question i think you were asking our 

Recording: (1537/ 2140) 
yeah i am actually like a month older than 

Recording: (1538/ 2140) 
but he would bring in nutritionallist an whatever to explain to the parents blablabla 

Recording: (1539/ 2140) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (1540/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1541/ 2140) 
yes you are you are saying you do not need to have a leader in a family and if i am going to be a leader i am going to be the one i am going to be the one not the sprim bank oh you came from this little tube here ohokay that is the principal vant no i have to be because there is no father here well 

Recording: (1542/ 2140) 
bye 

Recording: (1543/ 2140) 
the uh technical a systance and policy end of it and hated it the other years were fine but those last three were pretty bad uh 

Recording: (1544/ 2140) 
oh my gosh it is one oft they o not like you know falling out of trees 

Recording: (1545/ 2140) 
um i talk to them every now and then 

Recording: (1546/ 2140) 
so i mean carrying cabinets and he will do it as long as you are paying him heu will do it 

Recording: (1547/ 2140) 
i am i am not built that way 

Recording: (1548/ 2140) 
well i do think axcess is too easy but it is sort of like anything else i think if laws were passed the people who were against it would be so you know just beside themselves that it would i do not know for how long but i think it would make the situation not with the shootings and things like that but i think it would make the just the gun situation probably much worse for a while because people would be you know doing illegal things to get guns and that 

Recording: (1549/ 2140) 
just theyre that into being sure you are relaxed enough 

Recording: (1550/ 2140) 
but i do not see it is negatively affecting me i still get all this stuff done i need to get done 

Recording: (1551/ 2140) 
doing the eleventh ad doing the twelfth you can take them as many times as you need to take them but if you do not pass them all by the time you graduate you get this sniffty little thing called an attendantes cirtificut it is not a real diploma it is like okay i attended i did not learn anything but i was there 

Recording: (1552/ 2140) 
yeah um i took one o four during winter quarter 

Recording: (1553/ 2140) 
was really great i mean it is just nice laid back country setting and you do not have to worry about that much crime whell your horse might get taken in the midle of the night but i do not have any horses 

Recording: (1554/ 2140) 
betgers i love it 

Recording: (1555/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1556/ 2140) 
well he his two mainuh main characters ind his cartoonar wor willey and jo 

Recording: (1557/ 2140) 
no 

Recording: (1558/ 2140) 
oh sure 

Recording: (1559/ 2140) 
but it it is teaching him discipline responsibility you can not do these things at this time you know i 

Recording: (1560/ 2140) 
no it was it was more black than white to tell you truth or it might have been even but now it is more black than white definitely now because i i live in a neighborhood where it is it is mostly black than white and that is where i have always lived my whole life 

Recording: (1561/ 2140) 
and bees and um with she had kind of a hard time in high school she was uh raped by a teacher in ninth grade when she first went into a school and from there it is just been a nightmare of what how that t is affected her you know anything she goes through you blame it on that or you go back and you say oh i wonder you know if she was like that because of this and you know so that is been a real struggle aind high school i was i never really 

Recording: (1562/ 2140) 
i mean if i would have chosen to do that well tat is my choice 

Recording: (1563/ 2140) 
and you know people do not have big families like they used to you know so 

Recording: (1564/ 2140) 
uh three years something like that hard to remember wsoim 

Recording: (1565/ 2140) 
 

Recording: (1566/ 2140) 
yeah yeahah 

Recording: (1567/ 2140) 
i never heard a thing about it all the time i was in the service 

Recording: (1568/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1569/ 2140) 
itt it is not a presidential issue cained at issue as far as i am concerned but uuh i am 

Recording: (1570/ 2140) 
so it is probably was not unexpected we just were not prepared for it i do not think you could be prepared for it 

Recording: (1571/ 2140) 
so but i had some really tough challenging jobs and yeah if i knew now what i knew then i probably could be a milliaonar with all the lawsuits of different yeah experience with um sexual harassment 

Recording: (1572/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1573/ 2140) 
and they were in itally and europe and uh there was not the definate enemy in vitnam that there was in europe i think that is part of it and of course the attitude of moshto the guys that went to vinnam was a little bit different from from awas probably as a consequence of our understanding of the the uh 

Recording: (1574/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1575/ 2140) 
yeah i um well and that was really um struggle you know a struggle for money and everything so i would take whatever would come along and when you work insecure jobs like that i mean you i had a different job every year i mean ta yeart would come up and i would say ookay here we go you know they are either going ta downsize or they are goin to do something and they always did so i was never really shocked and i did not panic or anything and i was never without a job and never had to i never missed um you know i would say 

Recording: (1576/ 2140) 
we took um or i took uh military ethics as a pilosophy course and that was really interesting because even though in even in that higerarky there is still certain contects within the contects of war for instance if if we both know if wed knowingly go into it as combattants and we are fighting for whatever cause but if we both are willingly going into it 

Recording: (1577/ 2140) 
yea 

Recording: (1578/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1579/ 2140) 
s out of the money behind them they have the lawyers behind them so they can sue for an appeal 

Recording: (1580/ 2140) 
when they drove by i 

Recording: (1581/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1582/ 2140) 
se 

Recording: (1583/ 2140) 
i went back and did a one year um schooling to get my nursing license i became an elpan so i do not have a degree my husband has a degree i put him through school i finishe finished his private school 

Recording: (1584/ 2140) 
and that is what i am sayingn attoning for sinsit is quite a hipocracy when you get a church telling you that you need to ask for forgiveness when what they did i mean in the church in zansville where i went and burried my grandparents and went through all my life over the door of the church as a picture of christofer collumbus with a missionary a preest and all his men with his sord drawn a dead native american at his feet and three more at the side looking on in fear now 

Recording: (1585/ 2140) 
got o pul if you got a pool table over down the hall i will show you it is kind of 

Recording: (1586/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1587/ 2140) 
kind of exciting because you are getting in on things that are really new and trying to master the project i am working on now uh is tryig to find a way to autom to create data that describes web resources so thate libeorates can take this data and put it in their catalog and ten te greate it with the regular collection ad we are doing a lot of with it yeah it is it is pretty it is pretty neat project a lot of new things the uh jova and the wb give us opportunities to do things 

Recording: (1588/ 2140) 
and decided to pursue the matter to the extent of marriage so that is where they ment no huh uh i i oud come down here two or three times like you know just trips through going to the airpourt and other missilanious things but um when i moved to the city i mean it it was a real big change because i have you know used to living in the country and then i moved into smackdab in the middle of a downtown area 

Recording: (1589/ 2140) 
oh really hatis ute 

Recording: (1590/ 2140) 
u 

Recording: (1591/ 2140) 
see i do not shut up so i would talk to them the whole time and so they would always be really verble and so it would seem like they had a much better understanding and could do things better than they really could like when my daughter was about five we got a hampster and i said well you know you make sure you give tim food and water and when it died id i was so surprised that she had not given it been giving it food and water because she did it occasionally but to a five year old you do not yeah they do not get that stuff together or when she was eleven we sold her 

Recording: (1592/ 2140) 
oh that is wy okay 

Recording: (1593/ 2140) 
motherly instinct towards you know oh and they arel like old eric you should have one and you know and he knows im kve one um i just knew at a young age i have always loved the animals 

Recording: (1594/ 2140) 
uh yeah so i think she is getting a better education than he did but it is because she is doing the work and she knows she is expected to and has to and he my son is the kind he woud rather play than work and so he he wrode a lot and 

Recording: (1595/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1596/ 2140) 
just a different time now uh i mean i remember uh one of the things i saw when i was a kid on a news cast you know wash uh uh the vitnemise guy a vig con guy getting brains blowit out on national tv you know and uh uh that did not make me go out and want to do that you know soh if anything it make me want not want to do it you know because my brother was in was not biting on he was in the army 

Recording: (1597/ 2140) 
much in school if that 

Recording: (1598/ 2140) 
it is right on their main street andh they have gorgeous really neat unicke things 

Recording: (1599/ 2140) 
that is it oh 

Recording: (1600/ 2140) 
wis six normal kids because ld kids would be creative and they would think of ways to get out of there and the normal kids would sit and cry 

Recording: (1601/ 2140) 
so i ended up doing that for about three months and ended up plunking out of uh ou in the in the first three months of t first quarter so uh then i got my notice in january so 

Recording: (1602/ 2140) 
u do not sligte as much 

Recording: (1603/ 2140) 
she was a cowboy and he was an indian 

Recording: (1604/ 2140) 
now that does not make any extra work for the teacher but it gives him a shot he usually will anser the concepts he will usually answer the main stuff that he knows and if you only grade him on that he might have a shot at a se or a be i mean there is all kind of ways to modify uh give a reduced work amount uh give a kid a copy of another student is notes of his or crummy and he can not study from them we even have a thing at our school that it is 

Recording: (1605/ 2140) 
that is true 

Recording: (1606/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1607/ 2140) 
for example so you should name her tammera 

Recording: (1608/ 2140) 
ah oh yea 

Recording: (1609/ 2140) 
i do not know what it is like to grow up i anywhere else i i know what it is like uh kind of like where my cousin lived in new york because i would go there in the summers but uh um did i like growing up in collumbus uh how do you judge that you know what do you compare that to 

Recording: (1610/ 2140) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (1611/ 2140) 
really the they ware the biggest aswils 

Recording: (1612/ 2140) 
uhi think when i was five because it was like yeah yeah i do not really remember them being really together 

Recording: (1613/ 2140) 
h 

Recording: (1614/ 2140) 
 

Recording: (1615/ 2140) 
o i tighten this goodit was like it is fallen t uh uh helough there i can go cool perfect 

Recording: (1616/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1617/ 2140) 
well also too once the last time youhave seen a baseball game kids playing a baseball game in a neighborhood 

Recording: (1618/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1619/ 2140) 
oh they were helping out the the new guys 

Recording: (1620/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1621/ 2140) 
yeah i guess they do i do not know what where where it is or how many they have 

Recording: (1622/ 2140) 
yeah they are going to most likely raise it up to twenty one since all these uh the kentucky and maryland colorado all those schools shootings and can not believe me i mean there is articles in there you would not it even believe if you have not read them 

Recording: (1623/ 2140) 
that is where you need to crye you can not just say hey wee got a shnook out here where we can screw him that is a problem and you are saying does it does it does it take home does it take church it takes morals and that is what i was telling before we got away from morals in our society we could care less about you i always say a good successful salesman will be able to sell his own mother i mean to sell his own mother on a on the market 

Recording: (1624/ 2140) 
you know 

Recording: (1625/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1626/ 2140) 
i do not have a good opinion of uh columbas schools at all no not at all 

Recording: (1627/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1628/ 2140) 
 

Recording: (1629/ 2140) 
of the puzle that that helps i think matheu sheperd helped also 

Recording: (1630/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1631/ 2140) 
because the problem with guns in my opinion is you do not have to think to use it it takes you know you do not have to sit there and load it and ind a split second i think we all are capable of shooting somebody for whatever reason you know just stupidity or whatnot just in a split second you know we we might have that once in a life but we can kill somebody that quickly and you can not go oh you know 

Recording: (1632/ 2140) 
o retire uh lucke to me like to mount sterling or something like that 

Recording: (1633/ 2140) 
should be tried and hopefully convicted on the facts and should not have anything else added into it i i think doing that is going to do the same thing that the many of the civil rigihts and the uh affermative action programs and the bussing did to people as going to turn people against uh gays like they turned people against blacks for a while although ultimately i think it did make a difference i i had a i have a black friend at the ohio education association who as very active in the sixties 

Recording: (1634/ 2140) 
 

Recording: (1635/ 2140) 
yeah probably have to go to doublin or you know worthington somewhere around there to find couple millionairs but uh 

Recording: (1636/ 2140) 
you know 

Recording: (1637/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1638/ 2140) 
it is just major things that you have to do that are a lot more time consuming 

Recording: (1639/ 2140) 
theyare 

Recording: (1640/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1641/ 2140) 
nd i figure thery will be plenty of he i tell my mome i just want green jellow you just e on to make me snack so 

Recording: (1642/ 2140) 
ih 

Recording: (1643/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1644/ 2140) 
it is an island but i plan it together i liked it there i kind of like i figure they will probably hook up but i do not like how the show this show and this happened with deep space and i doi in even with next generation for a little bit how the shows become soap opera like um i mean the romantic aspects of the story s do not really appeal to me very much um i am more interested in the social things ian you know good old special effects um but uh 

Recording: (1645/ 2140) 
oh that is right 

Recording: (1646/ 2140) 
but she was never interested in you are never really interested in boys or in sports and high school or make up and clothes and things like than you know you are setting yourself up for ridicule in high school for that and ni sot himes she would come home in tears because e kids made fun of her and stuff and finally she just stopped going and within a couple months she got her gd 

Recording: (1647/ 2140) 
nd i do have a brother 

Recording: (1648/ 2140) 
oh then you would not be too familiar with everything 

Recording: (1649/ 2140) 
gotten somewhere else 

Recording: (1650/ 2140) 
nop 

Recording: (1651/ 2140) 
to uh you know to art whatever it is whereever it comes from and there is not tha you know there is not the the old boy network you know not as not as much who you know to get into things uh or or that women are allowed to know the people that the boys know so it is not it is not as closed off that way 

Recording: (1652/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (1653/ 2140) 
it was it was specially it was my job but as you know the parents always get stuck i have a brother 

Recording: (1654/ 2140) 
fruit loops yeah and it is like what is the difference you know besides the price 

Recording: (1655/ 2140) 
i really did not because i felt like i was in love with these boys yeah 

Recording: (1656/ 2140) 
 

Recording: (1657/ 2140) 
like ninety nine easter broade or something like that 

Recording: (1658/ 2140) 
most of the are still sadly just sitting there and following my directions but they are getting better 

Recording: (1659/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1660/ 2140) 
you know when he can ressle with them and all that right now he is just he sits there and when he cryes he goes what does he want like i know go down the list hut and change his dight for if he it is been three hours since he is had a bottle give him a bottle you know 

Recording: (1661/ 2140) 
dayso yes in my opinion definitely its eroding i know you took a little different approach in answering a question uh from over the time that tht this kind of thing is roti based apon the word respect 

Recording: (1662/ 2140) 
it is a traffic jim and i am not moving as ia 

Recording: (1663/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1664/ 2140) 
umhumum yeah 

Recording: (1665/ 2140) 
birmingham alabama 

Recording: (1666/ 2140) 
um so i am sure that ly increases the rate in public schools for 

Recording: (1667/ 2140) 
because i guess at it all came together because i do not understand how people can let their kids be hurt but 

Recording: (1668/ 2140) 
no 

Recording: (1669/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1670/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1671/ 2140) 
yeah like like sort of i mean with likeh mp threes and stuff uh people do a lot of that but it is it is i dot i do not know i a i do not really go on tha nd out all that much like i do not know 

Recording: (1672/ 2140) 
oh yeah yeah we all get together we have to get a shelter house now somewhere because the nobody is house is big enough well and then we have so many little kids that it is great because uh we just go to a shelter inside and they have it you know like for christmas and things like that and they can run around the kids run around and 

Recording: (1673/ 2140) 
um-hum um-hum but i do not know if that is i think the the divorce rate has gone up because it is more socially acceptable i am sure there is plenty of people twenty years ago that would have loved to have got a divorce had that been an option um i i think it s just i think a lot of it is just depends on the way you handle it you know how you how you handle it after after theh divorce is final i mean not do you see what does that make any sense at all 

Recording: (1674/ 2140) 
um i mean obviously it is something that happens every day and things like that um like said by no means my saying yeay go president clinton or anything like that but u i mean i can not say i would hold it against him for doing something like that i mean it is nothing that threatened the nation or whatever 

Recording: (1675/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1676/ 2140) 
like on a fairly regular basis even 

Recording: (1677/ 2140) 
yeah exactly which is one of the things tit rent into arcitecture where i mean we only had you know one or two papers we had to wride 

Recording: (1678/ 2140) 
her and her mother went and seen it andeveything we were divorced at the time and uh then i went and bought the movie and 

Recording: (1679/ 2140) 
and my mother was always there for me i would just call my mom like you now what can i do and she just like callme down rachiawl just calm down and 

Recording: (1680/ 2140) 
where are yu whereare you usually from 

Recording: (1681/ 2140) 
wout being with them 

Recording: (1682/ 2140)

sad stories oh let us see i do not know that is basicaly who i am 

Recording: (1707/ 2140) 
you know they never ask for extra money and uh they had to cut back on everything and it i think it just set people back now we are trying real hard to catch up and at some point we are going to uh you know have to put a levey on again and and uh who knows what is happeed we are keeping rosa smith right now because she is so good pr with e with the business community but the business community ind collumbus does not really support the schools it 

Recording: (1708/ 2140) 
to stop without it uh and and that is too bad you know that they thengs are have been that bad in some like ah world war too i mean we did not really have any choice there not tha but uh some of the some of our wars have been unnecessary and uh so but you know you can get you can get a philosophy but 

Recording: (1709/ 2140) 
because they always dress up and everything when they go to the bars so 

Recording: (1710/ 2140) 
ore been around you know but um more i think doctors should more look on that avenue you know that possibly it is something else like that i have never had a d well now whith the forms you fill out with your physicians and they ask you if you know about allergies and usually it is um prescriptions and things you know i mean that you have taken but they i do not know i think a lot of things have to do with food allergees any more i really do 

Recording: (1711/ 2140) 
have it meeting the missionaries and 

Recording: (1712/ 2140) 
oh no now they move you around all the time when you ur when you teach kids with learning disabilities they move you to where the population is rather than move the kids to you so yeah i have been in columbus and worthington or the two systems i have been in but y know th with in those systems they can move you around from school to school i mean it is the same one now for this is my seventh year at the middle school 

Recording: (1713/ 2140)

Recording: (1716/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1717/ 2140) 
yeah and uh i had the prerogative i could have gone somewhere else and made more money you know but the bad part was is the universiti is trying to do away with civil service civil service is a good thing and a bad thing you know you do you had step raisers and everything so at least you did have an increase back then nowadays you have nothing 

Recording: (1718/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1719/ 2140) 
yeah well peopleis people do not have the priorities that they should you know what do you do you work all your life and you make a lot of money and then you die what did you do you know did you learn anything did you teach anyone did you have an opinion about anything you know i mean that tol me if you do not have time then you know you are just floating along trying to pick it up space no 

Recording: (1720/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1721/ 2140) 
yeah yeah they say it is going to be hard to do in some of the other states but i do not think so 

Recording: (1722/ 2140) 
i just did not see where it w would be use utilized here 

Recording: (1723/ 2140) 
oh yeah um yes and no they are kind of weird like that um one set of grandparents really i can not hear ever says anything they are sat on the other side that they are a little bit more racisd um but at the same time it i do not know they almost set up 

Recording: (1724/ 2140) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (1725/ 2140) 
the people who who really like my work happen to be the people who are vacationing from columbus so 

Recording: (1726/ 2140) 
nd he is real because people give him that 

Recording: (1727/ 2140) 
i think more what they need to do is in strict or uh just make stiffer penalties to people that carry the guns or that are involved in shootings and things like that um because i mean for the most part i mean people really do not get too badly punished for things i mean if you look in other countries i mean like people like the asian countries places like that i mean thave really strict laws i mean if you even get caught for like 

Recording: (1728/ 2140) 
ou know because then what dos yeu have to hide and then like the fact that he did not know like i think on international policy he will be struggling if he becomes president he did not know the three leaders of the world thing and then on top of it like texas is a fairly big economy but still like to manage than entire you know antire economy 

Recording: (1729/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1730/ 2140)

Recording: (1734/ 2140) 
eu can not traide that but yeah my my one sister that is um exactly seven years older than me we are the closest and then the sister that is two years older than me she is the same way she does a lot of things that i am like why are you doing that you know they wolnt doht so and she is she pretty much stays low and depressed a lot because of everything she goes through but 

Recording: (1735/ 2140) 
i think he needs counseling t that oit 

Recording: (1736/ 2140) 
yeah yeah i guess so tat mean there ire people spend seen to spend hours on computers doing this type of thing just going out there and seing wat they can find 

Recording: (1737/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1738/ 2140) 
and they are rady to move on again you just do not get as close to people as you used to 

Recording: (1739/ 2140) 
um i mean fact of the matter is if being gay is a genetic disorder then that should have no effect on the kids because they should still be u normal i guess or whatever you want to say 

Recording: (1740/ 2140) 
a not as much as i used to be when i was younger used to be dihard but not any more yuou know um-hum yeah by their standards but they still were six and six you know and they probably could have wone maybe a couple more games but that is about it you know really 

Recording: (1741/ 2140) 
simply because it is not too much of a change from the status quo 

Recording: (1742/ 2140) 
um 

Recording: (1743/ 2140) 
he discribed him there

Recording: (1751/ 2140) 
mhum 

Recording: (1752/ 2140) 
hum 

Recording: (1753/ 2140) 
where they are almost segragating themselves by having these organizations because they are geared specifically towards black people and i think in ae way that is almost segragating themselves from the rest of the community because they are not given out equal opportunity the people that need them um it is sort of like the same thing white people were doing you know thirty forty years ago where that they had their white organizations or what not um and i think it is sort of going along the same lines 

Recording: (1754/ 2140) 
that would be neat that wouldbe real neat but that is tream world so 

Recording: (1755/ 2140) 
you can not especially with kids t is just too overwhelming 

Recording: (1756/ 2140) 
yeah ye 

Recording: (1757/ 2140) 
i do not know uh maybe i think abe if teachers just their status in society is not real high when it should be um it is more ik iy have heard that like garbage men get paid more than teachers you know and how but it so it is just like people always talk about you know education for thah you know we got to like think about our child is fuchere or whatever but really teachers are paid crap and i do not really get a lot of respect from anybody like professors and stuff get 

Recording: (1758/ 2140) 
yeah if they nt if they you know choose i am i am sure there is you know women that are lesbians that have been with men also you know theyhave been with the men and then they have been with ha women now now they got a girlfriend so obviously you know and i feel like that was because they had a attraction towards women so now they think they are lesbian i do not see i do not that is why i think so i do not think that but if that is their choice that is their choice so i do think they could change 

Recording: (1759/ 2140) 
um i would say it does not really matter either way honestly i men fact o the matter is they are so deal with it i mean get over it i mean 

Recording: (1760/ 2140) 
um i think i think through education that is it is just going to only help 

Recording: (1761/ 2140) 
i 

Recording: (1762/ 2140) 
um-hum it is it is it is american tha from the fact that it is um it was ritten by native americans and and um and josaf smith was not american and he was used to to translate it so e is at it is actually funny though but there is more members of the church that live outside of america

Recording: (2023/ 2140) 
what i have liked so much about it is they tell you everything and then you find out that it is not right and that is wrong i mean there was thepiso 

Recording: (2024/ 2140) 
because there is some people that actually can not work

i think the one of the things that we when when you are baptised is that you are really supposed to help other people to like if if somebody gives you a gift you want to give it to someone else but it is easy a lot of times just to fall into the you know like mold of not letting anyone know what you believe and just so that they think well what are those weird ose you know they do not wear makeup or whatever but we we can wear a make up 

Recording: (2031/ 2140) 
no there is a lot of people go to church that are not worth anything too you know so i do not really believe that going to church you know uh uh makes you a better human being than another human being i believe thatether youare i believe that most people iis basic uh structure in life if it is based similar to the bible or you could say boodiism or whatever you know uh uh that youa tend to have a better life than you will if you practice non 

Recording: (2032/ 2140)

yeah i did and then she she was she kind of a gossip she went around talking to everybody trying to get them all suppot hm and nobody would support her 

Recording: (2053/ 2140) 
well you know it because i have to think about how it went back into our income with everything else but i am sure i am sure that i did not pay more than three thousand on it and it you know i did not cost me more than three thousand and so if i had five or six thousand dollars out of it i was happy

Recording: (2056/ 2140) 
d that kind of thing i think is pretty important just you know because of the simple factor of the statistics that they are they are doing it so at least at the very least they might as well be you know safe about it 

Recording: (2057/ 2140) 
no not really oh i i feel a huge difference for me personally um just in the um closeness ind being able to pick up on his cus a lot better and just knowing his needs

Recording: (2069/ 2140) 
um-hum yeah yeah it is been glammorized and they do not they do not value human life either i do not think because there is so much violence you know you can not watch tv and not seeing somebody gets shot or something and it is just like it is not really rel because it is you know you turn the channel and then you see the same actor doing something else you know like see it was not real and i do not think they i think

Recording: (2074/ 2140) 
the three ars you know i think those are still very important 

Recording: (2075/ 2140) 
havenonsor anything there i mean um you know i think they were sort of more concerned with you know actually it might have been later than the first um sex education we had that young i mean it might have been more like a couple like eighth grade that they d talked about econdoms i douht that they would havedone that that early now that i think about it but i know that there was at one point you know some sort of 

Recording: (2076/ 2140) 
right right 

Recording: (2077/ 2140) 
well i thought about that you know i mean doing something in the animal area even as a vet assistant but um with domestic animals um 

Recording: (2078/ 2140) 
and you have been going to a hih state that whole time 

Recording: (2079/ 2140)

perfect example you know or your computer can not tell you that you spelled o n e when you ment to spell db o n 

Recording: (2086/ 2140) 
everybody is living longer everybody is uh there is more medical things where people get uh can be healed from things that they could not be healed from uh so everybody today is living uh basically as today as or future where back thirty years ago i mean when i was a kid you know i mean i was not really thinking about today i mean i was thinking about tomorrow 

Recording: (2087/ 2140) 
that is a thing but the thing is some people some people say some people say wel wayoyoug o this the thing is why do not you h talk to tose peopl say hey why not do hat i am doing besst now we complement the team 

Recording: (2088/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (2089/ 2140) 
um i think it is probably some of both i think it is probably more social but i mean obviously they are going to have different views on how things work um but i mean for the most part i can not see that it is being too big of a problem um obviously there are more like violent guys out there an things like that than there are women but at the same time i would not say there is anything to over 

Recording: (2090/ 2140) 
i know i i never i never looked into that but that is a good suggestion they yeah like liked being that tha they are going to be like you uh like spanish instructors no i i never thought about that not until you just just uh just just said it so yeah or like teaching english as a second language i know they teach those classes here so i was thinking well you know maybe i should tart looking into like teaching classes but i was like well i did not know that was like true or not thaut you can actually teach around 

Recording: (2091/ 2140) 
you know he did sneaze but he knew i was not going to get rid of the cat i would had her she was my daughter

i mean my my kids went to a school that when my son had already left it but in the fourth grade they announced took all the kids in to the auditoriam and said we are closing next year and it was hard but yeakh once it is reached the point that is decision is made and announced and i mean there were good reasons for it uh and they explaind the reasons and you know at some point you have to figure out how much do you want to fight something when 

Recording: (2093/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (2094/ 2140) 
i 

Recording: (2095/ 2140) 
um i think i think through education that is it is just going nto only help kids because a lot of times maybe they do not get that at home so they are really looking to choose the right thing to do 

Recording: (2096/ 2140) 
a lot of exciting stuff going on thowh for librares it is not not the old you know e old lady in the bun yeah yeah and the web has really changed that 

Recording: (2097/ 2140) 
 

Recording: (2098/ 2140) 
uh 

Recording: (2099/ 2140) 
on tv and in the movies 

Recording: (2100/ 2140) 
i do not even read it much it is very conservative very republican yeah 

Recording: (2101/ 2140) 
mount you know and uh i was just brought up to be an honest person and u unfortunately there is a lot of people out there that you know they sell out their ideals and their principals for forty thousand dollars a year and then they use their family or their situation financially ixcused to sell those ideals out um not that kind of person and i want to ever be um so if that means that i stay monitarily poor 

Recording: (2102/ 2140) 
 

Recording: (2103/ 2140) 
exactly 

Recording: (2104/ 2140)

Recording: (2106/ 2140) 
uum 

Recording: (2107/ 2140) 
i always wish somebody would do a survay on that and say you know back in sixty five or whatever what is the difference between what they are teaching them then and what they teach them now is it really that or is it just our imagination tist do not remember enough yeah wet seems more to me and computers really have helped it 

Recording: (2108/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (2109/ 2140) 
it it might i mean i good teachers do that i i i still get upset when i was teaching school i did activity base teaching um and i was doing some volunteer work at doublin schools wit as supposed to be one of the better schools in the area and i thouh there would be all sorts of creative things going on and there was not it was still read the chapter rite the answers to the questions at the end of the bok and i thought how boring i mean there different ways to get kids turned on to things um i am not sure there is so much influence 

Recording: (2110/ 2140) 
exactly 

Recording: (2111/ 2140) 
so that like it is just the sheer numbers of it i think 

Recording: (2112/ 2140) 
um

Recording: (2124/ 2140) 
i mean i can not see it being a problem of any sorts um i mean just as long as they have someone that cares for the kid and does stuff for them i mean i can not see it being any 

Recording: (2125/ 2140)
