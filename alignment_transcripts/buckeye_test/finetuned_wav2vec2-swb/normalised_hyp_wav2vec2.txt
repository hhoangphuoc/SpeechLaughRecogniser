yeah i like that 

Recording: (150/ 2140) 
o 

Recording: (151/ 2140) 
yeah but i have gotten more influence i think maybe i am not sure i am hoping i have got more influence over him than his father does 

Recording: (152/ 2140) 
yeah i mean i want to see how the season ends out it is just a lot of the ones this season to me i have just been disappointing the i mean i think every show sort of has a peak some shows peak towards the end some iat the beginning and sort of level off i mean th the simpsons had a stretch from like their third year through like their seventh where things were just like unbelievably funny and then they had some writing changes i think and this this season it is just 

Recording: (153/ 2140) 
and we started talking again and it was just like we had no missed anytime and started dating 

Recording: (154/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (155/ 2140) 
whereas i do not know louothern is a little bit more open to 

Recording: (156/ 2140) 
so we have really never had a lot of use for the union but recently we just figured out that you kn know if they decide to strike we have no choice too and you can not work because they will take all the money you make crossing that line so you can not work anybody that came back to work will lose all the money that they make they will take them to court and they will yeah it is against yeah it is against the union contract so you had us 

Recording: (157/ 2140) 
h 

Recording: (158/ 2140) 
i think that i do not think that divorce is a bad thing i think that it is if you are married and you realize that you get to a point where you and this other person are are not in a positive relationship for each other where for anybody else in your family that it is better to just say look this is not working we both deserve to be happy and we and and and go your own separate ways um i 

Recording: (159/ 2140) 
it kind of a well i have seen worser um so i an they are doing this i think it is called sit ang reach where he is got to sit on the floor and he is got to raise his feet up just so and and he is got to take his hands and reach towards his tos and he they do that for you know like five minutes the first time and they increase it and he really hates it 

Recording: (160/ 2140) 
but then that hurts the the the administrators in the sense that they ware there to provide aneducation so it would be rough and like my high school they they put up cameras and they had like they locked bathroom like at certain times you could not go in them and like it was getteng and they had like we are on the front page of the accrambucan journal because they had a lock down where no one was alloued to leave their classroom and then they brought the the dogs through and they found i 

Recording: (161/ 2140) 
you can not you can not be matded somebody for choosing a livestyle you just can not life is too short you know i mean you can love them either way it does not make any difference 

Recording: (162/ 2140)

Recording: (487/ 2140)

um actually i was over there when all of that happened but of course it was all over the papers and you know i think i mean i i do not know what it was like really here i can imagine but i mean there especially they really focused on um not columbine but the one with the the younger kids in arkansas was it the year before i was there for both of those but you know in the first one you know they they put the picture of the little kid in combackt gear holding the gun everywhere

Recording: (509/ 2140) 
like i am not i am not really sure like how they how the interview works to become a teacher um i am o not know i think it is like a lot of times they are really despaerate to find people and so they really just take whoever i mean they are lucky enough to even have a body to fill the place and they are doing well enough i mean the kids are learning the material i mean sort of i mean i mean i it is working well enough i guess

i think society us today up today is less tolerant of uh a lot of things that they see where people getting by with stuff you know and they are more vocal about it as opposed to being by ont aboutt it back in the sixties and stuff you know uh not here but you know down south there are people still getting hung and stuff you know for being a black or something and uh you know there are bad blacks wand there are bad wites too you know so but 

Recording: (513/ 2140) 
w

um-hum yeah 

Recording: (837/ 2140) 
that is perfect 

Recording: (838/ 2140)

women really do not need thae sweat loge but it is there for them and they do participate um 

Recording: (842/ 2140) 
oh okay well the reason i asked was it seems to me a lot of the impatice for going to church or going back to church for people is when their kid gets old enough to go to sunday school <laugh> starting asking questions about religion and you are saying well i suppose i could answer all these but <laugh> yeah 

Recording: (843/ 2140)

Recording: (849/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (850/ 2140) 
g i would say and then i would also say that you know uh because a a a number of reasons that people do not vote for school levies now is because they do not have kids in the schools you know but education is the foundation of a democracy and if you do not have an educated citizenry uh youre democracy could go down the drain uh that was why thomas jeffherson founded so many schools or you know the the university of virginia and believed in education you know because he said without an educated citizenry you will not understand the issues you know but 

Recording: (851/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (852/ 2140) 
wa 

Recording: (853/ 2140) 
hm 

Recording: (854/ 2140)

Recording: (855/ 2140)

Recording: (883/ 2140) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (884/ 2140) 
as he was speaking and and as he s tarted tos speak i realized too another thing that i really feel has a tremendous inmpression on how we as people are doing here but how the politicians are s because the world in essence is getting smaller because the communication has gotten better and all these other countries ind us are just like all one country anymore or something and i think that is had a tremendous influence also on our politics and on we as a people 

Recording: (885/ 2140) 
see tomorrow i mean hold them feel the warmpth of the body uh hear the conversation quietly rather than uh hearing okay time to get out o here u you know with ha vigarous thing but a pleasant sort of remark these kinds i cot elabrat i coult rite a woole book on that on this on a answer yourrs <laugh> uh but it is these kinds of things are very ellementary really they are very elementary i guess to 

Recording: (886/ 2140) 
 

Recording: (887/ 2140) 
right right he would go for weeks he would get mat me and he would speak to me when i was growing up for a week or two at a time my mother would say please nancy i changed my name whn i went to college i just decide i am out of here i am everything is gone and so she would say um nancy please just talk to your father just for just for my sake please and i would think i am a child here i should not have to be the one to make peace in this family if he does not wan to talk to me i do not need him i do not have to talk to him 

Recording: (888/ 2140) 
well it is sort of like the sociology of like clicks you know like how how that develops like how people like some people seeak to like fit in like i like ti that is a real strong uh like 

Recording: (889/ 2140)

Recording: (896/ 2140) 
yeah exactly i know 

Recording: (897/ 2140) 
yeah um-hum 

Recording: (898/ 2140) 
it is always been my feeling and and uh i try to be fair in the way i grade um you know it is i try to be as ubjective as i can some times i i because i think it is important that people learn how to write i would ask all my classes to write an ssay or a short 

Recording: (899/ 2140) 
you know 

Recording: (900/ 2140) 
yes 

Recording: (901/ 2140) 
hat is pretty extreme 

Recording: (902/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (903/ 2140) 
oh gosh 

Recording: (904/ 2140) 
their ideas i mean the guys are trying to look older the girls are trying to look younger 

Recording: (905/ 2140) 
wel then they had to after that they had ther lottery number and that was not if you were hot you know if you got your number was picked i mean i dont know hih it wuld be worse knowing that you were going to get a notice and being able to prepare for it or i duh because i have had friend thtae gotten uh numbers and everything you know and and getting ha high number and sitin e ere gong on lyke god so 

Recording: (906/ 2140) 
um it wis just yeah i guess the mafia was a big problem they just take over everything and they they do not pay their workers and most people are not mofius so they do not get paid <laugh> 

Recording: (907/ 2140) 
but i do know my my my brotherinlaw mentioned too his uh parents sa gosh what a sacrifice you guys did for us and he is just turnd fifty andthey dont have any kids and he says wot know how you did it well for one thing they probably did a lot of sacrificing and when you sacrifice it becomes makes you more humble 

Recording: (908/ 2140) 
uh the younger kids would not think anything about it 

Recording: (909/ 2140) 
uh a type of life style and that life style is gone everybody is independent everbody is going their own ways and if you happen to be lucky enough to find somebody that is looking in the same direction you are and is equally as independent then it might it might work but um i you know and who knows why each person gets divorced i mean each one of them was an individual situation and um 

Recording: (910/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (911/ 2140) 
uhuh from the watch towers yeah youare kind of like you know looking up and says you know samybody is you know got their sights on me yeah because that is it is like you know like you know it that t is like the wood wore too stuff you know there is like the remains i am sure but t is like if you cout you see the wall it is like there it i mean i am sure there is like tha there uh wha from what i understand that it wis lie 

Recording: (912/ 2140) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (913/ 2140) 
so how uh this works out you know ido know i just i am just like okay she just says i just want to get it over with and see now she you know 

Recording: (914/ 2140)

Recording: (916/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (917/ 2140) 
see that is great though 

Recording: (918/ 2140) 
um so i mean basically my opinion on that is just leave it up to them i mean if they want to take the risks obviously they know <laugh> 

Recording: (919/ 2140) 
if you if if if you say buy buy from those unscrupulous business people i say gee these guys gan not have credit <laugh> what happens to that person that fils bankrupty by bank rupty okay i will do something else agan ththin nex next time 

Recording: (920/ 2140) 
well i really think that is happening right now because i think that i do not know what the divorcestatistics have been recently but i do f see that more people who are getting married are staying married because thorse that do not those that would have gotten a divorce they are not bothering to get married to begin with they are just livhing toguether and thit they separate so what and i think that 

Recording: (921/ 2140) 
yeah and it it has the least amount of people which is kind of neat as far as truisem so 

Recording: (922/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (923/ 2140) 
i am looking for a parttime job as we speak i have been like doing temporary on and off u the thing with that is you can work you know for four or five months and then nothing and then like that so right now i am looking for something permanent 

Recording: (924/ 2140) 
you know just experiencing someone for who they are and so she is 

Recording: (925/ 2140)

Recording: (926/ 2140) 
it was just so i did not object to that one at all 

Recording: (927/ 2140) 
that that would be seriously fun but uh it depends if you work industry you get money 

Recording: (928/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (929/ 2140) 
realy 

Recording: (930/ 2140) 
n they were just wild you know i just ran every minute and i took it as a substitute and did not know from day to day you know whether it is going nto keep it i finally had to say i can not do this twenty seven kidner gards i am sorry i calnot do this by myself 

Recording: (931/ 2140) 
um me or 

Recording: (932/ 2140)

Recording: (936/ 2140) 
yoau know and i just told them whant hazed to do with my belief system so heure in violation of the first amendment you know so and then they realized that i was not stupid so you know they just made things more and more difficult for me you know so i just decided to since they were not going to change i was just going to leave you knw but so it is you know it is it is a hard way you joose to walk yu if you are an idealistic person and is i mean just more se 

Recording: (937/ 2140) 
is it any worse than baseball cards or you know 

Recording: (938/ 2140) 
and hou said divorce is more acceptable divorce should never be acceptable 

Recording: (939/ 2140) 
yeah i had a cousin that went on she she was in school for that and um as you could tell i like to do office work i 

Recording: (940/ 2140)

Recording: (942/ 2140) 
um 

Recording: (943/ 2140) 
<laugh> whole lot more places to live it seems like everywhere i turn there is construction and and you know you go down n one road and then you wait a couple of years if you do not go in that area and it is all changed it looks all different so and that is mainly like looking up bethel and three fifteen or things like that 

Recording: (944/ 2140) 
you know he was in oh yeap they both worked during college and and i guess my dad was on theh gi bill after the war so that is how he got in here and had to work some part time work uh get his degree um-hum it is just east broadstreet just franklind park onr 

Recording: (945/ 2140) 
i mean that goes along with my customs and beliefs i mean we are going to send our child i al ready know to parocrial schools there is no way i am going to send him to a public school and even my my husband is a u boy scout um leader and just listening to the boy is there he he did a program last night on respect 

Recording: (946/ 2140) 
the ultimate would probably be a parttime thing you know but neither one of our positions offer any type of part time were we have some friends that do that where they only go two days a week or something which is they get a little bit of both of the world so 

Recording: (947/ 2140) 
do i think they will oh yes i think they definitely will i think there is so much heavy uh political and financial l i am ma reverse that statement uh there is so much heavy financial influence up on the political uh influence that e it it is almost a forgone conclusion andand if it does not occur this within this year and uh there may be another vote in another year or next a next election but i think that in fact it will go 

Recording: (948/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (949/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (950/ 2140) 
you know 

Recording: (951/ 2140) 
athat is what iasan 

Recording: (952/ 2140) 
yeah at uh yeah they they have had two different articles in err uh about it whell they had a big article uh back when uh it was hat jesse jackson was down there or something a couple of years ago or something and uh he made a concertad effort to try to let people know how pover op most poverty is down thereve and everything but then you go to a lot of other extremes you know where you sat tur these people would not want to live in collumbas so 

Recording: (953/ 2140) 
i mean i think he is done some positive things that wholle thing about um uh as far as like your student loans and being able to get intoit as helped me you know and i think you know all this that as far as some of the issues go i think that that i feel pretty similar to the way he does um some of his foreign policy things i think i have gone pretty decently but i mean i think i do not i do not know i mean i i 

Recording: (954/ 2140) 
yeah from what i hear actually the like the emmery and the um university of chicago you have to work really hard because they get all the kids who wish they would have gotten to harvard and then start you know trying to make it up by working harder you get to actual harvard nobody works because they are like we alreready made it you kn 

Recording: (955/ 2140) 
u uh well that is a that is a tough one uh i remember you know when we were we had you know some movies like that but they were like the bowery boys and stuff you know we are it was you pretty much knew it was all take anyway you know but eand to me that is a pake and uh uh and i never really thought about it while i was growing up that it was what was real and everything uh i always knew that by i there again you know by my dad being 

Recording: (956/ 2140) 
he he is a very he is a disciplinment 

Recording: (957/ 2140) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (958/ 2140) 
plel do this and we will do this so whe checked out the catholic school and they were organized that way and it is just what is a better better match for him and then when my daughter went to school it was just easier to take them to the same school you know and and that gos back and re minded me of another thing i wanted to say about my ether discipline and and behavior may be different in the catholic school is weu are paying big you are paing bucks you know it is four tou forty five hundred dollars a year for us to send her to school 

Recording: (959/ 2140) 
yeah i figure right now i might as well take advantage of it 

Recording: (960/ 2140) 
yes 

Recording: (961/ 2140) 
a businessman my dad and i have been screwing around with stocks for years um i am been in contact with a um day trading firm down in west virginia and they are starting an intern program sometime i do not even know when but if the if that opens up i will probably seriously considered going down to west virginia un they are in richmand west richmand yea i have been saying west virginia have not i they are in virginia sorry theyre they are home basis in um richmand virginia so 

Recording: (962/ 2140) 
a year and then i went into the aramy ind nineteen forty spring of nineteen forty one before p harbar and i was in uh service for uh four and a half years in italy most of that time nor north africa and hen ittaly ind uh i had meit a ah uh girl before i went into service and so 

Recording: (963/ 2140) 
t then when i found out there ware so many openings in special ed so and then i found out later that speech theirpy as a very good background for eld because a lot of these lld kids have language deficits and language problems they they can not you know like express themselves on paper where they do not process things correctly auditorially so that is the perfect background to work with lld kidsd i did not know i was doing that at the time but 

Recording: (964/ 2140) 
i made a difference 

Recording: (965/ 2140) 
that is great 

Recording: (966/ 2140) 
yes and now uh when we ware in boy scouts we got kicked out of it <laugh> 

Recording: (967/ 2140) 
and uh well shei thehthe people that own it are starting to build it up now but it is been like that it was the first department community uh in columbus it was built in thirty eight i guess 

Recording: (968/ 2140) 
um people that live there i mean we have got the the you know the indian department stores right down there on high street and and couple of asian groceries but i you know i i i do not know where they live <laugh> i mean it it seemsit seems like for those stores to be opening there there must be somewhere in klintenville but i do not i do not know 

Recording: (969/ 2140) 
allright 

Recording: (970/ 2140) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (971/ 2140) 
i do not know i i would not personally like think that the parents should be held responsible i mean they do have you know a certain amount of responsibility for the fact that they should have been more aware and and especially because i mean i believe that those o at least one of the two had been in counseling and adhat you know was doing aggression management or something like that um you know you would think that if they were going through something like that you would just sort of you know maybe 

Recording: (972/ 2140) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (973/ 2140) 
i monce of turis hear about it you know it is like you know 

Recording: (974/ 2140) 
um 

Recording: (975/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (976/ 2140) 
well basically it is the same thing here but some of your management is real good i have seen people that that you know are super but i have seen people that are bad the problem is you get a bad management and it can make your life hell i do not care who you are 

Recording: (977/ 2140) 
all you do is you just keep your records of of um you know what you spend on things and then there is a formyufill out and how much you have if you have taken any depreciation you know you need to basically put that back in and deduct your cost and then there is a percentage that goes on your schedule ethat goes an the front of your form that goes into your income and then it is just taxed it is just no it is really not that hard 

Recording: (978/ 2140) 
 

Recording: (979/ 2140) 
um-hum yeah i am just learning the area so but i like it so far it seems really nice and uh seems like there is a lot more to do in columbus obviously but 

Recording: (980/ 2140) 
um 

Recording: (981/ 2140) 
everyone might experiment or try or make a mistake but the way he is handling it saying i am not even going ta dignify that question over and over and over if he did not do it he might as well just bee like kno i did not do it 

Recording: (982/ 2140) 
downtown which is where this my one of my orchestras plays a lot and uh we sang in other different kinds of churches and said what we liked about in what we did not <laugh> <laugh> maybe it had some feet back i think the new building is accoustically very good it is certainly much better than old worchip center because i do not know if you have seen a picture or anything of the church but the old worship center t was designed by a modern arkhitect 

Recording: (983/ 2140) 
um-hum at this point u i am not a uh i am not against the urban schools but if it was my own personal child i would r have moved to a suburban area untill collumbas gets their act together they are in so such bad shape right now that i do think the state will take over the columbas public schools in two years yeah they have threatened it um and if they do not pull their schores up um they will you know 

Recording: (984/ 2140) 
and move on um that is that is basically my faar but uh as one of the guys tried to help me said well listen i am afraid of that too so because right there in that pit there that is got ow if you remember that there is nothing in here that can hurt you even as hot as it gets you know and when you think about that you try not to think too much while you are in there although 

Recording: (985/ 2140) 
or they you know they come back to visit me sometimes from the high school 

Recording: (986/ 2140) 
yeah it is ridiculous i mean plus it is a nationally recognize school so a degree from ohio state i mean you could go anywhere the nation someone is at least going to recognize becuse it is a big it is a big big name ashland it would be more of a sell i would be like okay w it is small it isa private it is credited but still

well i agree that we should help them maybe through some sort of government program but i think what really hurts them the most is the people that actually give them the money on high street because it really does not motivate them to get out of the gutter i mean if they can make a living off of beging change off of college students they are probably going to stay with that because it is really easy life

okay 

Recording: (1397/ 2140) 
well yeah i think it is real important to really good to get a good um feel for how you are and all your beliefs and all that they have to really match and um and if they do not um then it is not ever going to work becau because there is always going to be conflict and friction and all that kind of thing so i think it is real important and there is no age limit on that to when you really feel good about yourself and you really know what you want to do then that is the only time that you can really commit and say yeah we 

Recording: (1398/ 2140) 
yeah i think basically normal hours would be like eight to twelve and then you go home during lunch time because that is the big meal of the day you go home and eat with your family that is really important

Recording: (1405/ 2140) 
so i think 

Recording: (1406/ 2140) 
m 

Recording: (1407/ 2140)

really 

Recording: (1519/ 2140) 
hand it is uh yes it i it is a catholic school environment so it will be interesting to see what evolves from the children is uh attention to the the roman catholic side of religion as compared to the baptist so 

Recording: (1520/ 2140) 
right and then they wonder why you know i do not know what is happened it is the other person who is changed you know and if you if you start changing your behavior you can usually get the kinds of changes i always figure if you treat people the way that will go and roal thing if you if you give out what you want back you get it 

Recording: (1521/ 2140) 
or like i talked to this one guy he was he was an nav seal and he did likea a couple f tours in viet nam and he was he was talking about how he was he was drunk and he was he was from alabama he was like yea i am about half drunk now so i am trying to figure out where this model number is and like we talked to him for like fifteen minutes 

Recording: (1522/ 2140) 
i think that is great you know i think obviously there is always a downside and but i think that too many people abuse the system and you know unfortunately it is very hard when you know then it ruins it for the people who really do need it and but you know as long as they 

Recording: (1523/ 2140) 
like it is okay i mean it is like a country school which was always real reard too i was always like meaning like my friends were always like the because hiy used to have real long hair and so that was like used to be like a big hippy or whatever and like um that was i guess weird kind of like being the od people and a in a small like in a small midwestern farming school it is kind of od i guess um onot know um

Recording: (1532/ 2140) 
wowu yeah i know 

Recording: (1533/ 2140) 
appeals appeals 

Recording: (1534/ 2140) 
 

Recording: (1535/ 2140) 
whole time i was in high school in college and all this kind of thing but it was just like you know people just thought oh you are american you are here therefore you must have lots of extra money to throw around and you know they just sort of do not grasp the fact that you know you can have made sacrifices to be there but i do think also in films you know i remember ectually being in bristal and that film california with brad penjuli lewis and you know they are in the trailer and everything else 

Recording: (1536/ 2140) 
i we now are another gragorian and uh that sort of thing but back to your question i think you were asking our

Recording: (1547/ 2140) 
i am i am not built that way 

Recording: (1548/ 2140) 
well i do think axces is too easy but it is sort of like anything else i think if laws were passed the people who were against it would be so you know just beside themselves that it would i do not know for how long but i think it would make the situation not with the shootings and things like that but i think it would make the just the gun situation probably much worse for a while because people would be you know doing illegal things to get guns and that 

Recording: (1549/ 2140) 
just they are that into being sure you are relaxed enough 

Recording: (1550/ 2140) 
but i do not see it is negatively affecting me i still get all this stuff done i need to get done 

Recording: (1551/ 2140) 
doing the eleventh and doing the twelfth you can take them as many times as you need to take them but if you do not pass them all by the time you graduate you get this snifty little thing called an attendance cirtificut hit is not a real diploma it is like okay i attended i did not learn anything but i was there 

Recording: (1552/ 2140)

Recording: (1556/ 2140) 
well he his two main uh main characters and his cartooners were willy and jo 

Recording: (1557/ 2140) 
o 

Recording: (1558/ 2140) 
oh sure 

Recording: (1559/ 2140) 
but it it is teaching him discipline responsibility you can not do these things at this time you know i 

Recording: (1560/ 2140) 
no it was it was more black than white to tell you truth ori might have been even but now it is more black than white definitely now because i i live in a neighborhood where it isrn it is mostly black than white and that is where i have always lived my whole life 

Recording: (1561/ 2140) 
and bes and um with me she had kind of a hard time in high school she was uh raped by a teacher in nignth grade when she first went into a school and from there it is just been a nightmare of what how that is affected her you know anything she goes through you blame it on that or you go back at you say o i wonder you know if she was like that because of this and you know so that is been a real struggle ind high school i was i never really 

Recording: (1562/ 2140) 
i mean if i would have chosen to do that well that is my choiceo 

Recording: (1563/ 2140) 
and you know people do not have big families like they used to you know so 

Recording: (1564/ 2140) 
uh three years something like that hard to remember <laugh> longtme ago 

Recording: (1565/ 2140) 
 

Recording: (1566/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1567/ 2140) 
i never heard of a thing about it all the time i was in the service 

Recording: (1568/ 2140) 
 

Recording: (1569/ 2140) 
a it is not a presidential issue canidit issue as far as i am concerned but uh i am 

Recording: (1570/ 2140) 
so it is probably was not unexpected we just were not prepare it for it i do not think you could be prepared for it 

Recording: (1571/ 2140) 
so but i had some really tough challenging jobs and yeah if i knew now what i knew then i probably could be a millionar with all the law suits of different yeah experience with um sexual harassment 

Recording: (1572/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1573/ 2140) 
and they were in itally and europe and uh there was not the definite enemy in vinom that there was in europe i think that is part of it and of course the attitude af mos the guise that went to vinom was a little bit different from from ar probably as a consequence of our understanding of the the uh 

Recording: (1574/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1575/ 2140) 
yeah i um well and that was really um struggle you know a struggle for money and everything so i would take whatever would come along and when you work insecure jobs like that i mean i had a different job every year i meano a yeare it would come up and i would say o okay here we go you know they are either going a downsize or they are gong to do something and they always did so i was never really shocked and i did not panic or anything and i was never without a job and never had to i never missed um you know i would say 

Recording: (1576/ 2140) 
we took um or i took uh military ethics as a philosophy course and that was really interesting because even though in even in that higerarky there is still certain contects within the contects of war for instance if if we both know if we wld knowingly go into it as combattants and we are fighting for whatever cause but if we both are willingly going into it 

Recording: (1577/ 2140) 
 

Recording: (1578/ 2140)

Recording: (1584/ 2140) 
and that is what i am sayingn attoning for sins it is quite a hipocracy when you get a church telling you that you need to ask for forgiveness when what they did i mean in the church in zansvill where i went and burried my grandparents and went through all my life over the door of the church is a picture of christofer colombus with a missionary a priest and all his men with his sord drawn a dead native american at his feet and three more at the side looking on in fear now

Recording: (1589/ 2140)

Recording: (1590/ 2140) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (1591/ 2140) 
see i do not shut up so i would talk to them the whole time and so they wuld always be really verble and so it would seem like they had a much better understanding and could do things better than they really could like when my daughter was about five we got a hampster i said well you know you make sure you give up food and water and when it died it i was so surprised that she had not given it be giveng it food and water because she did it occasionally but to a five year old you know yoa they do not get that stuff together or when she was eleven we sold her 

Recording: (1592/ 2140) 
oh that is w okay 

Recording: (1593/ 2140) 
motherly instinct towards you knowo and they are like old aric yoeu should have one and you know and he knows o cnve one um i just knew at a young age i have always loved the animals 

Recording: (1594/ 2140) 
uh yeah so i think she is getting a better education than he did but it is because she is doing the work and she knows she is expected to and has to and he my son is the kind he would rather play than work and so he he wrote a lot and 

Recording: (1595/ 2140) 
 

Recording: (1596/ 2140) 
just a different time now uh i mean i remember uh one of the things i saw when i was a kid on a news cast you know was uh uh the viitnamise guy uh viccon guy getting brains blowed out on national tv you know and uh uh that did not make me go out and want to do that you know so if any thing it made me want not want to do it you know because my brother was in was not viitin on he was in the army 

Recording: (1597/ 2140) 
much in school with that

Recording: (1599/ 2140)

Recording: (1600/ 2140) 
is six normal kidsbecause elld kids would be creative and they would think of ways to get out of there and the normal kids would sit and cry 

Recording: (1601/ 2140) 
so i ended up doing that for about three months and ended up plunking out of uh ou in the in the first three months of the first quarter so uh then i got my notice in january so 

Recording: (1602/ 2140) 
ou do not slide as much 

Recording: (1603/ 2140) 
she was a cowboy and he was an indian 

Recording: (1604/ 2140) 
now that does not make any extra work for the teacher but it gives him a shot he usually will answer the concepts he will usually answer the main stuff that he knows and if you only grade him on that he might have a shot at a ceevor a be i mean there is all kind of ways to modify uh give a reduced work amount uh give a kid a copy of another student is notes of his or crumy and he can not study from them we even have a thing at our school that it is 

Recording: (1605/ 2140) 
ttrue 

Recording: (1606/ 2140)

Recording: (1623/ 2140) 
that is where you need to cry you can not just say hey we hav got a shnook out here where we can screwimg that is a problem and you are saying does it does it does it take home does it take church it takes morals and that is what i was telling before we have got away from morals and our society we could care less about you i always saiy a good successful salesman will be able to sell his own mother i mean to sell his own mother on a on the market 

Recording: (1624/ 2140)

of the puzle that that helps i think mathe sheperd helped also 

Recording: (1630/ 2140) 
 

Recording: (1631/ 2140) 
because the problem with guns in my opinion is you do not have to think to use it it takes you know you do not have to sit there and load it and in a split second i think we all are capable of shooting somebody for whatever reason you know just stupidity or what not just in a split second you know we we might have that once in a life but we can kill somebody that quickly and you can not go o you know 

Recording: (1632/ 2140) 
retire uh luck to me like to mount sterling or something like that 

Recording: (1633/ 2140) 
should be tried and hopefully convicted on the facts and should not have anything else added into it i i think doing that is going to do the same thing that the many of the civil rights and the uh affermative action programs and the bussing did to people is going to turn people against uh gays like thay turned people against blacks for a while although ultimately i think it did make a difference i i had a i have a black friend at the ohio education association who wis very active in the sixties 

Recording: (1634/ 2140) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (1635/ 2140)

Recording: (1645/ 2140) 
oh that is right 

Recording: (1646/ 2140)

where they are almost segragating themselves by having these organizations because they are geared specifically towards black people and i think in a way that is almost segragating themselves from the rest of the community because they are not given out equal opportunity the people that need them um it is sort of like the same thing white people were doing you know thirty forty years ago where that they had their white organizations or what not u and i think it is sort of going along the same lines
