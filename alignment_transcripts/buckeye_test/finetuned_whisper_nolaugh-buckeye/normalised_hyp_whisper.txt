Recording: (20/ 2140)

Recording: (21/ 2140)

Recording: (31/ 2140) 
well that guy who could change for them that and in the movie they were about to kiss i mean i i do not like it when they get that close i i like the how oh their their relationship is still professional and they interact with each other on that level first and they are very good friends and they have that tension but they do not to it and i really like it i just dislike it a little less 

Recording: (32/ 2140) 
uh and uh her decisions are happening to her without her making them and um i think she needs to have as many facts as she can get her on 

Recording: (33/ 2140)

Recording: (34/ 2140) 
um i do not i mean there definitely is that image of you know dallas and dynasty i think it is it is worse i think for the the image of the tourists like basically they think anyone who can afford to be over there must be absolutely loaded you know and that was sort of another thing when you know i went to school there is you know i had a scholarship that is how i went there you know and i worked the 

Recording: (35/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (36/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (37/ 2140) 
really 

Recording: (38/ 2140) 
said that and he is like 

Recording: (39/ 2140) 
uh yeah well um i think the teachers are everybody as good as dead dedicated but i think there seems to be uh the whole administration up through the board and just it is not as i do not i do not know how it is great it is like the teachers have sort of it seemed like they almost had the feeling they were on their own were 

Recording: (40/ 2140) 
so and it was it was neat though because pete was my mom was twenty nine and pete was eighteen and so pete was just like some kid who liked to play you know he would go and buy kites and and do all this fun stuff and 

Recording: (41/ 2140) 
so 

Recording: (42/ 2140) 
yeah i i do not understand it i really have a hard time understanding you know they are not after you they just wanna live a life 

Recording: (43/ 2140) 
you do not yeah yeah 

Recording: (44/ 2140) 
um i would not know that long 

Recording: (45/ 2140) 
see i he is a he is just he is in his twos and i like he is gotta be in a court or something well because when i am holding his hand taking him he just tends to want to he is not calm and collective he is little you know um so like that is why we do not do nothing because when i take them to people is houses i can not do that because they will get into everything and i um i get real stressed out about that i do not i do not 

Recording: (46/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (47/ 2140) 
i i had parents that everything i did was negative i mean they just told me i could not do this could not do that and and so what i try to do is when anything comes up i was thinking of how my parents would handle it and i do a hundred and eighty degrees so you know because you know they just i do not know how i got i sort of feel i am mentally okay now but i do not know how i got here because i have been there way you know and it is uh you know 

Recording: (48/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (49/ 2140) 
it was uh part of the time 

Recording: (50/ 2140) 
big people coming from other cities like chicago new york you know and places like that where they were treated poorly by whites you know they um they tended to act differently towards you and everything until they realized that you were not like that you know uh we only had one race once in it when i was in the service uh where it was we were predominantly white uhatoon and uh because we worked in missiles and stuff you know so 

Recording: (51/ 2140) 
you know my daughter you know there is just a lot of stuff when she was in high school and i would call up to the school and you know the principal like he would say you take miss you know i am i am her last chance you know my daughter was going to summer school every summer and he is like misses you know she is like you know the average student uh word word 

Recording: (52/ 2140) 
wonder if that is also a socialized medicine there it is socialized in it 

Recording: (53/ 2140) 
okay some people get like flying do do their do their little wedding thing fly out 

Recording: (54/ 2140) 
do you want 

Recording: (55/ 2140)

people that were pushing the free speech gets mugged or you know anything else happens to them 

Recording: (57/ 2140) 
yeah okay 

Recording: (58/ 2140) 
what is good now uh well the web again has changed that there is computers have made a big difference uh it is more exciting now for people who are in the area um who are interested in it is more emphasis on information and not books and things uh going to the libraries getting the information 

Recording: (59/ 2140) 
and so you know even though it turns out to be the real traditional breakdown it is not it is not because i have to it is not because he you know he would not do something that else it is this suits me fine 

Recording: (60/ 2140) 
they could do it and my grand my one grand daughter uh they live in springfield they just moved to springfield and she goes to kindergarten oh half day and this child is only uh five years old uh he has them reading the newspaper for watching the news she told me a story about christopher columbus uh discovering 

Recording: (61/ 2140)

Recording: (65/ 2140) 
do not have auditions they just take anybody that wants to play and if you take a string player that can not play in tune it can really wreck everything yeah but uh i think we have improved a lot we we gave a concert um a couple weeks ago had a church in upper arlington and uh i thought it went pretty well one piece a little bit of mozart uh some concertos word word 

Recording: (66/ 2140) 
see our paper so when you write on the white copy it comes through on to the yellow copy and at the end of the period the student just rips off the back copy and hands it to his friend so he you did not have to write you know if he was not getting the notes 

Recording: (67/ 2140) 
answered and added in the paper uh but i have sung in the well shon sings in the symphony course too i have sang in it for sixteen years 

Recording: (68/ 2140) 
she wants to go to columbus state uh wants to get into one of their engineering tech programs um um-hum and i i hope she does because she she never in in high school she is very bright she is mature in so many ways but she is had to be responsible for herself for her whole life um 

Recording: (69/ 2140) 
so right i mean she really is yeah it is one of those things where she just does not turn in her stuff you know and it she is twelve 

Recording: (70/ 2140) 
yeah it is the brady bill did not really do it for america like they thought i mean yeah you wait five days big deal go out on twentyth avenue and pick one up in five minutes you know i have seen all kinds of people carry guns that should not 

Recording: (71/ 2140) 
word 

Recording: (72/ 2140) 
it is beautiful and we like going to see the ski resorts and i think i do not really ski 

Recording: (73/ 2140) 
on it and his report card he is got like a one point two five average so they take jalena who has an a him who has a d and they go well gee the average kid in this school is like plus and they are stupid at this school columbus like schools do not do any good then you go to dublin worthington westerville in order to get there you you are not gonna be in his condition and you are not gonna be stupid because you are trying to you know you probably both husband and wife work so the intelligence is there and you are not gonna have dumb people 

Recording: (74/ 2140) 
personally 

Recording: (75/ 2140) 
no 

Recording: (76/ 2140) 
um 

Recording: (77/ 2140) 
yeah so um-hum right 

Recording: (78/ 2140) 
um the parenting stuff they gave us a video to watch at home which was things like how to diaper your baby um the thing about whether you should leave them crying in their in their bassinet or crib which of course i think is horrible and i think it is good that they have come out with all these new studies that tell people do not do that um let us see what also was there feeding your baby i mean the just 

Recording: (79/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (80/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (81/ 2140) 
because you got beaches and and yeah yeah i mean i mean it is like i do not think like you can compare it is i would hurt 

Recording: (82/ 2140) 
uh 

Recording: (83/ 2140) 
to offer me that or or tell i mean she is the first i never even heard of it and um there is another there is all kinds of programs that you know like there is this one that um where like say i i live with my mom my mom can be getting paid from the government for me to be living there you know because she kind of helps me out you know and i do not know what that was called i mean i am just now finding this stuff out you know it is 

Recording: (84/ 2140) 
and not that that changed my opinion of her um but back then nobody would talk about it and you know i just think in today is world we need to bring subjects like that out knowing because there is so many people who are ashamed about things and they should not be ashamed because it is a lifestyle anymore you know i just it needs to be brought up more 

Recording: (85/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (86/ 2140) 
mother he used to be a principal of mine in elementary school so uh he is like i think we should talk i was like okay great kids are like oh boy you are way too serious for that particularly if they are okay that is fine we knew ahead of time the was also coming to and and do not worry about it so i i um at this point in the story i should point out that the paper that i went downstairs for i do not know where that is i never found it never saw it never it it is anyway not relevant in all of the story but it bugs me every time i tell the story because does not exist anyway 

Recording: (87/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (88/ 2140) 
lived in the dorms my freshman year and then i moved into a house with a bunch of guys i met yeah so what was different um one of things that i really enjoyed that was different as the traffic and that really no that really that really became really became uh interesting and different for me when i started working for a courier service winter quarter i took off i took all classes off winter quarter and worked for courier service because i needed some money and i love driving and let me tell you it is really really different 

Recording: (89/ 2140) 
and there are some people that deserve to be fired and there is no way that you can really differentiate just because they are in a union they 

Recording: (90/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (91/ 2140) 
there i do not there was nothing there that really i could remember that did anything good for me i mean i think middle school taught me a lot school 

Recording: (92/ 2140) 
for the the slick image just bothers me um he has a potential of of trampling gore i think that gore will be the the nominee no matter what bradley does gore has it shown up because he is the insider um it 

Recording: (93/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (94/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (95/ 2140) 
right right that is right yeah so that that was not interesting and when we went to church up hamilton and over and on on morse or up new albany road to morse and over to high street none of that commercial stuff was out there on morse road i do not know if you know morse road very well but there at out out by carl there is shopping center after shopping center after shopping center after housing development after but when we did 

Recording: (96/ 2140) 
to the other side 

Recording: (97/ 2140) 
terrible murderers get away with murder now by that pliebarkin that pliebarkin i think is the most thing that ever was passed i do not think they are should be any police bargains and then i would be so well but there are people who get murdered and instead of electric chair electric chair i still believe in it because they have some what it and i do not believe that they should have ten years of uh what do they call that legal process where they can wording appeals thank you that is it 

Recording: (98/ 2140) 
yeah because i mean five years went by like 

Recording: (99/ 2140) 
so 

Recording: (100/ 2140) 
oh that was the monica lewinsky 

Recording: (101/ 2140) 
you know like i told her it is the way i was raised 

Recording: (102/ 2140) 
the honors class is challenging and organic chemistry is very challenging but 

Recording: (103/ 2140) 
she uh has trouble driving even at night and stuff like that 

Recording: (104/ 2140) 
before i found out actually so so we can start we can stop the story here we can go on it because the story is an it is a fun story but 

Recording: (105/ 2140) 
and i did a lot of music interviewing and writing there and then i moved up to editor and it was sort of through that job that i got my first job with sony while i was as a as a sort of ohio representative so i was concentrated in ohio state and then you know basically it is just something i am not doing this as a career it is just sort of something i am doing in the meantime till i decide whether i am going back to school or 

Recording: (106/ 2140) 
she is she yeah she is expanded her horiz if you will and 

Recording: (107/ 2140) 
do not have any evidence to uh to support it i just know that i have not i feel that i have a distinct a just a very clear distinction between what is uh fact what is fiction what is true and was imaginary and uh so for me i do not think that television has affected me in that way um i mean one way that like television has affected me is i am full of media references 

Recording: (108/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (109/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (110/ 2140) 
green day packers 

Recording: (111/ 2140) 
see that is how my husband was he did not have a pet growing up 

Recording: (112/ 2140) 
yeah i got more people by prisons for though 

Recording: (113/ 2140) 
that is still enough for me 

Recording: (114/ 2140) 
wow yeah 

Recording: (115/ 2140) 
i mean i i i do not know enough about it to really say but it i can not i mean it i do not know where they got that 

Recording: (116/ 2140) 
yeah i can not wait 

Recording: (117/ 2140) 
uh new kid the boyfriend girlfriend the different things they were trying behind the building you know and just the boy girl i mean just not nice no 

Recording: (118/ 2140) 
you know 

Recording: (119/ 2140) 
and then when it became cold enough in september october maybe even as far as november this year would have been november we would take those shoes out and depending upon who is foot fit those shoes those would be the person that were it would not be the one who had worn them in the spring because he is growing in the meantime time and uh and it may go to another another and i can remember we passed shoes down as many as four we children now my dad also repaired shoes 

Recording: (120/ 2140) 
you know 

Recording: (121/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (122/ 2140) 
well you have to um try some different things like put on headphones with music that does not have any words and try to read somewhere like 

Recording: (123/ 2140) 
um yeah that is what they suggest doing is two years of med school get your p h d and then do your last two years of med school 

Recording: (124/ 2140) 
oh there always has been there always has been i think a lot of people feel that kids a lot of kids are on medication today that should not be but um i think that is the fault of the school or the parents or some doctor that like for example when we refer kids in orthington to a doctor we have a list of three doctors that we work with and we know that they will not just give this kid a pill if he does not have eight out of the twelve symptoms or 

Recording: (125/ 2140) 
i am sure i am sure it is you know it is just the circles i move in 

Recording: (126/ 2140) 
oh that is true 

Recording: (127/ 2140) 
ten years no question about it that is it you are in jail for ten years eighteen years old if you have got anything on ten years that is it you know and you look at some of these other people and like they sports people and 

Recording: (128/ 2140) 
word 

Recording: (129/ 2140) 
four four years ago i do not know it is been a while four and a half years ago something like that 

Recording: (130/ 2140) 
yeah i am a democrat i have never voted for republican in my life even when i lived in oregon and always the door to mark had filled i did not vote for him there was some words saying because i thought he was a great republican well but i think uh personally my coleman was good i i have met uh well 

Recording: (131/ 2140) 
needs for that budget they bought things on a cash basis as they needed it they did not go out and spend on credit now a minimum german hemispuff here but businessman said hey let us produce these lines little lady you want a refrigerator we can make it for you and we can make it cheap for you because we can mass produce it 

Recording: (132/ 2140) 
word 

Recording: (133/ 2140) 
i mean i did not have the greatest childhood i do not think any of us ever really had the best you know but but i do not like i would not talk to my kid the way some of these people talk to her well at one today you know and she got on the bus and little girl went and said over here she is probably about eight maybe six or something like that and she wanted to sit here mommy so she made her sit with her which is cool and mommy just goes to sleep and all the kids trying to study her homework you know 

Recording: (134/ 2140) 
disciplined i would be screamed at may would get jumped on the floor to do pushups i mean it was it was 

Recording: (135/ 2140) 
hum 

Recording: (136/ 2140) 
his mother died um the week after he got married she had diabetes um uh juvenile diabetes diagnosity at eleven and just over the years uh um ended up having open heart surgery and did not make it through the surgery my grandmother also died during open heart surgery so my perception of open heart surgery even though i am a nurse it is not very good just because of the two 

Recording: (137/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (138/ 2140) 
deep space nine in that uh they address the issue of different people living and working together different people of different i mean these were aliens rather than different ethnic denominations of humans but it approached that from a less um from a more realistic standpoint and instead of having like an old star trek you know everyone gets along then we come 

Recording: (139/ 2140) 
um originally in north side 

Recording: (140/ 2140) 
my son now i saw him when let us see he was fifteen maybe he would run across the street when martha the eighty six year old lady across street was trying bring her garbage down he would seen me do that go oh let me get that for you martha she is got arthritis she looks like she is gonna fall she takes steps about this big and seen him do that 

Recording: (141/ 2140) 
then you are really gonna get out of it what you need to 

Recording: (142/ 2140) 
which door to um buy a swimsuit my sophomore year and he was the cashier there 

Recording: (143/ 2140) 
in adequate but he that was even through nursing school i mean those were not things that were discussed you got special conferences to get information on that 

Recording: (144/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (145/ 2140) 
um-hum yeah 

Recording: (146/ 2140) 
uh 

Recording: (147/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (148/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (149/ 2140) 
yeah i like that 

Recording: (150/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (151/ 2140) 
yeah but i have got more influence i think maybe i am not sure i am hoping i have got more influence over him than his father does 

Recording: (152/ 2140) 
yeah i mean i want to see how the season ends out it is just a lot of the ones this season to me have just been disappointing the you i mean i think every show sort of has a peek some shows peek towards the end some at the beginning and sort of level off i mean the the simpsons had a stretch from like their third year through like their seventh where things were just like unbelievably funny and then they had some writing changes i think and this this season it is just 

Recording: (153/ 2140) 
and we started talking again and it was just like we had not missed any time and started dating 

Recording: (154/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (155/ 2140) 
whereas i do not know luthra is a little bit more open to 

Recording: (156/ 2140) 
so we have really never had a lot of use for the union but recently we did figure out that you know if they decide to strike we have no choice too and you can not work because they will take all the money you make crossing that line so you cannot work anybody that came back to work will lose all the money that they made they will take them to court and they will yeah it is against yeah it is against the union contract so you had this 

Recording: (157/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (158/ 2140) 
hum i think that i do not think that divorce is a bad thing i think that it it is if you are married and you real you get to a point where you and this other person are are not at a positive relationship for each other or for anybody else in your family that it is better to just say look this is not working we both deserve to be happy and we and and and go your own separate ways um i 

Recording: (159/ 2140) 
kinda yeah well i have seen worse her so um so i mean they are doing this i think it is called sit and reach where he is gotta sit on the floor and he is gotta raise his feet up just so and and he is gotta take his hands and reach towards his toes and he they do that for you know like two five minutes the first time and they increase it and he really hates it 

Recording: (160/ 2140) 
but then that hurts the the the administrators in the sense that they are there to provide an education so it would be rough and like my high school they they put up cameras and they had like they locked bathrooms like at certain times you could not go in them and they it was getting and they had like we were on the front page acumbe can journal because they had a lock down where no one was allowed to leave their classroom and then they brought this the dogs through and they found i 

Recording: (161/ 2140) 
you can not you can not be mad at somebody for choosing a lifestyle you just can not life is too short you know i mean you can love them either way it does not make any difference 

Recording: (162/ 2140) 
that is why it is mainly appealing to instate people you they pay you to go to school 

Recording: (163/ 2140) 
i they have like way more than like they do have any other state i think so that to me is not that is not adorable and then i that is one reason i would not vote for bud yes 

Recording: (164/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (165/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (166/ 2140) 
um i am signed up for architecture right now which i like architecture but i think there is probably more time into it than i am ready to actually commit into it 

Recording: (167/ 2140) 
yeah hard week i thought

Recording: (192/ 2140) 
not really national system it is already been put the national if they write them state the state and city the city but on on the level of the actual needs of the student you know you can not just put down you know a book and say i want you to put five hundred words on this page while you like this or dislike this book i mean one person can do it and another one mean 

Recording: (193/ 2140) 
gates was recognized he was nothing

that is a good way 

Recording: (204/ 2140) 
uh and as i say we went to church fairly regularly but to tell you the truth i can not remember too much that i always taught then but but i was exposed to it anyway and i i am sure that some of it rubbed off on me 

Recording: (205/ 2140) 
right now 

Recording: (206/ 2140) 
period and it is that is a long process i mean this has been going on for two hundred years this way uh and people are suspicious of government asking questions 

Recording: (207/ 2140) 
i think that influences how everybody behaves not only the kids the adults too 

Recording: (208/ 2140)

Recording: (226/ 2140) 
you know you know concertino wiring bar wiring all those like a big big uh break wall and whatever you can actually you know still see it unless they tore it down okay just like to preserve the history of it okay right oh so you actually is that is that like because you were like a part of that history at least when you were over there 

Recording: (227/ 2140) 
we are going to do and a boy if they say that and they really make it so and ask them two or three times on tape that they understand this before they sign this even well then how could they say that they that they have got to come up with new rules and they got to make the penalties stick 

Recording: (228/ 2140) 
well unfortunately i do not think it is fair but i think in the long run it it does not have to be a college education because most of those people probably would not want a college education education um but like a trade or a skill or something that will give them a little bit of hope if they do wanna choose to get a job instead of robbing a bank or selling drugs or whatever they did they have that choice it is it is it is up in their head okay i can either go become a welder or 

Recording: (229/ 2140) 
in the business world and otherwise i used to work uh during uh high school days for a furniture company and but in those days it was nine days cash and we would sell the people and as a and i said well gee we just and they talked to manager oh they they do not have the they do not have the money that is finance at the bank well why are we selling it to them then well we will get our money back in the bank at the money we will get we will repossess it and we sold the same darn thing over three or four times 

Recording: (230/ 2140)

Recording: (231/ 2140) 
like us to me that was very strange 

Recording: (232/ 2140) 
no no um my i was born in new york i was applying um i then went to tennessee with my family and was after i was six months old 

Recording: (233/ 2140) 
i you know from my perspective which is screwed of course to me i think it just seems that way i mean it was we are only talking about ten cases that is not very many you know i mean you could by coincidence have them all be african american um if i were african american i think i would have a different perspective and i you know i do not do not live in a neighborhood where we see a lot of police so uh you know i just do not i am not i am not in touch with it with 

Recording: (234/ 2140) 
um sector and i think that is a good sign but i think there is a huge there is millions of children that do not have any healthcare and that is not right there is like there is a of like between the lower and the upper there is a huge disparity but at least it is a step in the right direction we have a a nice solid middle middle income base i think because a lot of countries only have the like i visited in mexico and seems like they only had the distinction between the upper and lower i mean their middle class is very small and that i 

Recording: (235/ 2140) 
um um 

Recording: (236/ 2140) 
well 

Recording: (237/ 2140) 
yeah both my own family all graduated megan was first in her class joe is ran first my brother philip is i uh was not you know but they are all they are all straight four point 

Recording: (238/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (239/ 2140) 
um well actually it is sort of all happening in a certain area you know with you know very high unemployment like council council states um you know this sort of stereotype you know kind of bad family environment you know parents have loads of boyfriends and girlfriends drugs everything else and you know a lot of these girls that have been interviewed you know 

Recording: (240/ 2140) 
like oh english people your accents so neat and all that kind of thing and then when i went there you know i and this was actually one of my friends but i remember you know she was german and she was sort of asking me how you say different words and things and then she sort of looked at me and she said like oh actually i should not be asking you i do not wanna learn the american way to say those like i wanna learn the and people would say things all the time and it was you know they would ask you what your background was and if you would say well i am american they said well you know like where you are 

Recording: (241/ 2140) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (242/ 2140) 
as far as i was concerned for what they were doing um you know one one principal that from my um daughter is high school he was out partying all the time they you know they he was he was running around in a corvet and uh he tried to take me out 

Recording: (243/ 2140) 
yeah exactly past three random jobs for 

Recording: (244/ 2140) 
they went they went to private schools they went to private schools i certainly did not want them to go to public schools and even when going to ohio state um compared to miami university i saw all different i see a differences in the standards of the of the students um but i believe and i have seen it with my son going to ohio state that he is more morals that he is gained through his uh pre college years are staying with them uh and i am very grateful that there is 

Recording: (245/ 2140) 
or to do anything extreme to their bodies 

Recording: (246/ 2140) 
everything that uh they all tend to talk to maybe you or talk to somebody else and uh uh like in the fourth they figure not believe a damn word they say 

Recording: (247/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (248/ 2140) 
fifty percent of uh everyone who marries has divorced within a matter of about five years as i understand the statistics today and uh uh unfortunately it is still increasing but there is a strong feeling that maybe this going to slowly reverse or at least decrease not reverse probably um once again we are talking about communications too and the communications can be ill and that can be great uh as she is touched 

Recording: (249/ 2140) 
crystal clarity and it is they will just run with it and that is what my mom came out of um her her denominate that she came out of she is not part of it anymore denomination she came out of it um some of the more devout churches within the apostolic christian we are talking men sit on one side women sit on the other women wear little thingies on their heads no jewelry the sermon is read in three different languages yeah 

Recording: (250/ 2140) 
sneak 

Recording: (251/ 2140) 
um-hum um-hum well you you had a good reason to be bothered 

Recording: (252/ 2140) 
because then you know what if something major happens that fourth time then what but i think i at least for children especially because they have no means to to help them oh and like the parents obviously even if they are working a lot of times can not get health care for their children so i think at least for children because how many accidents happen to children like always breaking arms and stuff 

Recording: (253/ 2140) 
saying that they wanted to save this nice white girl because i had so much potential and uh they were not gonna let me throw my life away like this you know it is bizarre and always from that time on i decided these these people are all crazy i am never gonna i am never gonna be like that and so i have a whole lot of different values family and it is real hard for them because all my other siblings who are younger are willing to 

Recording: (254/ 2140) 
yeah yeah i think so yeah 

Recording: (255/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (256/ 2140) 
word 

Recording: (257/ 2140) 
probably 

Recording: (258/ 2140) 
i never learned math we had in fifth grade we had the principal realize that nobody knew their times tables had a big pizza party planned for or 

Recording: (259/ 2140) 
it is a lot of money 

Recording: (260/ 2140) 
yeah probably because we have some public systems most of them are for the librarians but there is some for public too 

Recording: (261/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (262/ 2140) 
just 

Recording: (263/ 2140) 
oh i would say family values customs traditions um divorce moving uh just looking at my sister my my my sister i mean she is very happily married but my god i mean they they lived here in columbus he is from alice they met here they moved to indianapolis they moved back here they moved up north they moved back now they are in london england they 

Recording: (264/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (265/ 2140) 
you know so unfortunately you know and i guess i never thought of it a lot more pressures put on schools in education now 

Recording: (266/ 2140) 
word 

Recording: (267/ 2140) 
his last name 

Recording: (268/ 2140) 
yeah and and it is just it is moving there the whole you know strip malls and i was in i spent my first christmas there in belgium with the friend and i mean we would drive by and you would just be like oh this is because of you know your country these people are moving in and buying whatever and so conversantly i see it moving in the other direction unfortunately rather than 

Recording: (269/ 2140) 
i mean that i i mean that probably can be proven i do not know if anybody would do any decent studies on it i just bet you a million dollars that you no it would be the influence of tv you know the and then and another thing that is well tv is in uh where it comes from but i think kids are all into pokemon right now 

Recording: (270/ 2140) 
less fortunate out there and that there is little things we can do 

Recording: (271/ 2140) 
and my sister was here like i said and then moved out just came back a couple months ago um my grandfather just passed away but he was here and enterising home for about a year 

Recording: (272/ 2140) 
it is like if we if america you know we are we used to be raised one way if we went to another country just kind of like you might wanna get to know the chines people but you might not quite be a little timitt about you know same kind of thing but i i am not i do not have any of those barriers 

Recording: (273/ 2140) 
yeah uh i i think that he is he is right to our my generation wish more uh oh do not wanna say spiritual but more morally uh well directed than 

Recording: (274/ 2140) 
um probably it would have been about six years ago i ran in sixth or seventh grade 

Recording: (275/ 2140) 
usually clintonville my mom she um she does not she is not a big fan of driving she does not really drive very much which is good i have run in a car with her one time and and just she just would prefer not to have we that is okay with us because she is she is got her drivers license for i d and those types of things but for the most part so she kinda stays like clintonville yeah 

Recording: (276/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (277/ 2140) 
money is not everything it is too bad sports have ended up this way 

Recording: (278/ 2140) 
because heck you know it is it is a it is the name you know it is it is it is like a it is like a tourist place 

Recording: (279/ 2140) 
i do think there is some and i do not think they probably get exposed to like the different walks of life i do not think they would probably be exposed to you know the gay lesbian i i think that would probably just be pulled over and they did not go very much in depth you know about sex and your sex ed classes were pretty little on the other me that was fine i do not know our friends that have eleven year olds that is going to public school i mean he had a parenting class already where he had to carry 

Recording: (280/ 2140) 
yep i afford that too i just it is different it is different and you know i keep trying to figure out now was it worse when they were at this age or is this worse you know you know and i then you can talk to some other people that are oh you have not seen anything yet wait till they just do not even wanna be inside with you and do not wait till they you know i am not going on vacation with you i 

Recording: (281/ 2140) 
treating children like they are just it just you have to respect them and you have to not not talk down to them and and that whole thing about you know why can not i do this well because i told you so 

Recording: (282/ 2140) 
they are there 

Recording: (283/ 2140) 
hum um 

Recording: (284/ 2140) 
and each other is throat for this that and the other and and you know devon is not my daughter is the one that really got put in the middle of it you know and probably it was a blessing that they moved to saint louis because there probably could have been more uh problems legal problems you know as far as uh going back and forth the court putting her on a witness stand for stupid stuff you know and so uh in hindsight it was kind of a blessing that they moved there 

Recording: (285/ 2140) 
they are normal people and i have met some really cool people who are who are homosexuals and that where that was going was um we went to access which is uh one of the home what is one of the gay um uh dance clubs in columbus it is um it is on high street it is down in uh it is down german no it is not is it 

Recording: (286/ 2140) 
first grade the first grade teacher was aware of what he needed but the principal would not let her give it to him give him had to do what everything everybody else in the class was doing he was even tutoring some of the kids in first grade and at the last grading period she would give them just every day she would give them a math paper to work on he said i showed you i know how do this i am not doing it 

Recording: (287/ 2140)

Recording: (288/ 2140) 
i 

Recording: (289/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (290/ 2140)

Recording: (291/ 2140) 
oh yeah they gave us ten thousand here is a dollar have fun 

Recording: (292/ 2140)

Recording: (322/ 2140)

Recording: (326/ 2140) 
um but they always say do not like that you know i am gonna sleep with you and all that and with the cat and they curl up with you it is hard to say get off the bed no but you know what honestly eventually well it it took probably a year 

Recording: (327/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (328/ 2140) 
really and it is a fun job it really is i have only ever known one male that taught first grade uh i knew one guy that taught third most of the time if they go into elementary ed they go for the upper grades like four five or six but um i really think that if we let the always be more exposed to men earlier then they would be more motivated to learn because they would see that it is not just a girlie thing 

Recording: (329/ 2140) 
word 

Recording: (330/ 2140) 
yes 

Recording: (331/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (332/ 2140) 
if it were possible i think that a lot of parents are trying to raise them what they think is the best right now and that is another problem it seemed like the way the financial world has come up and everything else the way the cost of living has increased it almost takes two parents in that home if you wanna really live a halfway decent life and be able to do some of the extra things no one wants to live and only have to be able to disuse like you said a while ago the necessities 

Recording: (333/ 2140) 
yeah where are they needed right 

Recording: (334/ 2140) 
no 

Recording: (335/ 2140) 
you know he says that e equals m c squared i say it is e equals m c cubed because the world is three dimensional it is not two dimensional uh two dimensional limits everything but you look at his theory relativity all of our mathematical theore physical theore on physics and things of that nature have been based off that 

Recording: (336/ 2140) 
now is when i need to be off with them you know where we can take them out and run 

Recording: (337/ 2140) 
four parties so because it is actually a market and it is all done outside like tonight we are going to the uh goberth rebellion which is um next to the theater it is really beautiful and people do a lot of parties there 

Recording: (338/ 2140) 
and he did that too uh 

Recording: (339/ 2140) 
it is like dealing the with this adoption of the baby we know that that is best but dealing with the emotions of it this is a it is grand we are very family oriented and it is this is a grandchild we will never see 

Recording: (340/ 2140) 
and just totally bombarded and i mean here it is so force fed as well i mean i i came home just before halloween and you know i i walked into the garage you store and i mean just like right there where just like cakes cupcakes cookies like everything just right in front of you uh with like all this halloween stuff on and i mean all all the holidays in here are so pushed at you and it is such a money making you know and it is so over top where there it is sort of like there is a little bit of that and there are decorations and 

Recording: (341/ 2140) 
if you just look at the nature of what they are doing it is just 

Recording: (342/ 2140) 
um-hum yeah well it was like i kind of just like stopped going to class and and like and i just like ended up with drawing because i would have like failed everything anyways but um yeah then i was living with my friend for a while um but and then like nowhere now me and her and one of the friends live in delon and maynard 

Recording: (343/ 2140) 
and then they are gonna say they want to know their parents you know their parents are sitting at home they have no idea what that kid is doing 

Recording: (344/ 2140) 
right well kind of like just because everybody else is doing it this way does not mean it is the right way and um yeah i you know i struggle with that because i come more from i think the family should teach it but let us be realistic how many families are gonna do that or how mentality to do that it seems like um something like my dad seems like these days most the people a lot of people that are having kids hum 

Recording: (345/ 2140)

Recording: (346/ 2140) 
yeah i just renew my certificate last year so i may get back into it part of the reason i renew my certificate was i did some home instruction with the columbus public schools last year and that is kind of like a tutoring job where you can go you can arrange hours with a student that is at home for some reason um i had one that just had a baby and um they it is an interesting job because they look for somebody that can cover 

Recording: (347/ 2140) 
run quick put plastic on oh i do not know it seemed like it is a tough call because it is very unusual situation here at ohio state where they have a union and they have so many difference skills in a union you think of unions you think of auto workers you think of pipe fitters you think of you do not think of such a wide variety of 

Recording: (348/ 2140)

Recording: (349/ 2140) 
um-hum um-hum i mean columbus publics they they got some work to do too like other night i was watching tv and uh and elementary school over dosed a kid on like some uh i think it was a drug to calm him down so he is not so hyper and they like over do twice in a day and then when he goes home his mom is even overdoesany because he they are overdoesany 

Recording: (350/ 2140) 
i do not know i would like to think i would like to say no sitting here but you never know because i guess that is because that is what happens to a lot of them yeah they they come out of school all i idealistic and then they go into industry and then they are melted and assuming they make upper management there is you want the tax breaks you want the thing you know what i mean and then they like i have an uncle he is a vice president on wall street from error lunch and he said you know he he got out of school and he was very idealistic but now he 

Recording: (351/ 2140) 
sure you you know you do something with them but this group the the middle thirties i called them you had a massage them and that is what clinton did so well and that is what dole could have done i am not sure if george w is gonna be able to uh because to get the the nomination eventually he is gonna come out and have to make his hard statements to those people which is i am anti abortion i i am pro gun he is already said the pro gun and that is going against what most americans are saying dole i think represented where most americans 

Recording: (352/ 2140) 
oh yeah yeah 

Recording: (353/ 2140) 
quarter 

Recording: (354/ 2140) 
and it i think some my feelings about that sort of thing is uh is is colored by the fact that i collected data for twenty years from employers uh i am a lot more sympathetic to that sort of thing um yeah i just lot more sympathetic to people collecting data 

Recording: (355/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (356/ 2140) 
whoa um 

Recording: (357/ 2140)

um-hum 

Recording: (376/ 2140) 
well i do not know if it is monroe county or 

Recording: (377/ 2140) 
and that is i think that is really a major problem and i think there is a lot of problem with the young kids today do it my way or uh they all have not hit them or 

Recording: (378/ 2140) 
yeah as i was teasing 

Recording: (379/ 2140) 
know 

Recording: (380/ 2140) 
heard that the more conservative unitarian churches are in new england around boston where it was started and there are some that are relatively conservative there but um for the most part it is it is what you would call liberal religion yeah are you 

Recording: (381/ 2140) 
the room and she has a two year old child and now another little girl um i said derric you know it is it is nice to go in there and see that but i just have no 

Recording: (382/ 2140) 
because the priest they had there would not let him take communion and all the other kids were taking communion and it is pretty much the priest decides that and he have and he felt singleed out he was i mean he was the only one and he was uncomfortable with it uh but it has some bit of problem uh i am not a really just person myself but i am not against it and if i and maybe i have justified it to myself by saying well they are teaching values 

Recording: (383/ 2140) 
it say no i would say uh clinical study where we are seeing how treadmill training affects ambulation in people with spinal cord injury 

Recording: (384/ 2140) 
on the spur of the moment i would have to think about that i really would 

Recording: (385/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (386/ 2140) 
it is just like your people usually go to church they will walk out of church to see somebody sitting there that is homeless 

Recording: (387/ 2140)

Recording: (389/ 2140) 
uh-huh oh well 

Recording: (390/ 2140) 
no 

Recording: (391/ 2140) 
and just started picking a fight with him 

Recording: (392/ 2140) 
in the 

Recording: (393/ 2140) 
i think it has changed drastically and i think it is changing and i think it will also be changing in the future uh going all the way back uh finances uh were were not a consideration in the in oh i say probably my first thirty maybe forty years there was some there was influence but i think the influence was not financial it was influenced from the person who could get up here and talk with a group of people and sway them with 

Recording: (394/ 2140) 
is that right 

Recording: (395/ 2140) 
sure 

Recording: (396/ 2140) 
exactly 

Recording: (397/ 2140) 
you got into a situation where you really there is a no win situation from the get go and uh uh i think that had we been able to do what we went over there to do initially it would have worked out okay but we were not so so it became political wars everybody knows anything about 

Recording: (398/ 2140) 
got ways to go it is getting better 

Recording: (399/ 2140) 
it is it is 

Recording: (400/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (401/ 2140) 
yeah that was after i got kicked out and i just decided i will go to work work for a couple months make something out of it i learned to trade 

Recording: (402/ 2140) 
exceptible so 

Recording: (403/ 2140) 
well the uh woof family and uh the mcdonald is have been around forever you know uh worthing industries and and the woof family is columbus dispatch uh and the you got uh i think it was rizudy uh who is not like a was a construction guy so uh uh they have been around forever and everything and uh they can get their ways through uh political arena and everything but i think most of the money was uh was private money but they were given like tax 

Recording: (404/ 2140) 
and my but now my daughter is my daughter has twin sons who just are a year out of college and uh think that they are uh one of them particularly is i think him good moral good sort of guy and the other one i do not feel like i know as well but 

Recording: (405/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (406/ 2140) 
hum 

Recording: (407/ 2140) 
yeah there is a lot we need to do a lot of evolving we definitely do 

Recording: (408/ 2140) 
think it was an a nice thing about we had uh we had uh grandparents that were not necessarily the around the state in some cases did not see them that much we made it a part that uh we communicated with the grandparents regularly and when we did it was a special time uh we um emphasize the fact that um uh you know kids want to do certain things okay they saw their mother go out and maybe do some additional things to 

Recording: (409/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (410/ 2140) 
to take this class like i think that if i but i mean it is good to be enforceed take a like a liberal arts thing because like you do not know what you want wanna do so it is like if like you hate math and you do not take it and all but then you decide you wanted to do something in math and you are like screwed like can not go back 

Recording: (411/ 2140) 
like they caught me 

Recording: (412/ 2140) 
really 

Recording: (413/ 2140) 
um well as far as my mom goes she is real into the catholic faith and i mean she made me always go to church and things like that 

Recording: (414/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (415/ 2140) 
but it and it is it is parents that fight for the society and the what is in your community you know the parents for each individual child they have to all form together as a group and almost be uh parents to all these kids as a group you know it is not you can be the best parent in the world at home and then your kid goes to school and it accesses the computer or they get in a group of kids where their parents they do not even know where they are you know it is the kid is responsibility to get and go to school you know maybe the mom and 

Recording: (416/ 2140) 
home we interact the school is great you have people that are on the clock whoop time to quit they are gone those people do not know the meaning of life they will never know the meaning of life but if they stay around tried to extend themselves little more with somebody that is having problems at work and are willing to work with that person i say willing to work not knowing they are gonna be compensated because they will be compensated 

Recording: (417/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (418/ 2140) 
you know like there are two fishermen that found him and see you never hear about the other one because that this was on one just briefly i heard on the news because he thinks he should go back to his father but you do not hear about him there is three cousins two of them think he should stay miami the other one thinks he should go back with his father you do not hear about him he is reading about a news week or someplace uh so i think the news media is not been totally objective about this 

Recording: (419/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (420/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (421/ 2140) 
they are covered but it was real tricky because she sort of had some she was a u s citizen she found out love through e mail over the internet back in the early like in nineteen ninety it was real early and went over there and married the guy uh and so she had some of the medical problems and she emigrated and uh it was just it took years to get that straight up but she is covered though 

Recording: (422/ 2140) 
how many times you have been in ireland 

Recording: (423/ 2140) 
if they had a way to cure it then fine but leave that up to the people 

Recording: (424/ 2140) 
that is how i feel that is that is what i believe i just believe that 

Recording: (425/ 2140) 
well it is like the i say 

Recording: (426/ 2140) 
this just can not go on not that they are gonna stop it totally 

Recording: (427/ 2140) 
gotta be a really busy day and i would the same thing at port columbus you know i i would see all these cars but it would be just about the same traffic and i am like and i mentioned somebody go where the x air airplanes and they go they can not add extra airplanes it is they have certain routes they can do they just have to put bigger airplanes on so i said you know you will see larger airplanes when it is day time so they can put more people on so 

Recording: (428/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (429/ 2140) 
oh 

Recording: (430/ 2140) 
yeah it makes me to pay the rent and uh that is yeah 

Recording: (431/ 2140) 
there was no such 

Recording: (432/ 2140) 
yeah so she said she is gonna be catching the disability bus out here you know after a certain amount of time she is gonna ride that bus 

Recording: (433/ 2140) 
or more accurately i think she took it but you know it is a fine line um and so she wears that around and i replaced it so i have my own again and i wear this one around so we have competition to see who can get the most well traveled ring you get two points for every country and you get one point for every state or province within that country 

Recording: (434/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (435/ 2140) 
um-hum um-hum 

Recording: (436/ 2140) 
like to talk about columbus 

Recording: (437/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (438/ 2140) 
okay that is good 

Recording: (439/ 2140) 
what we should buy yeah the retailer what we should buy and that is the problem we listen to business too much if business reemphasized their goals to help society out and not themselves 

Recording: (440/ 2140) 
and i think um course we all hope the abortion would not be that that nobody would have an abortion that would be the perfect world nobody would ever be in a situation where they would need one um but i also think uh you know i i mean yeah there should not be there should should not spend six weeks on abortion or six weeks on what to do if you are pregnant um but but i think the subject has to be mentioned just just in passing 

Recording: (441/ 2140) 
i think for the most part people can handle it um obviously i think probably more the older generations would be the ones that have the bigger problem with it the ones that grew up like during the whole black rights movements and things like that um i could see them having a problem with it but i mean more like like more of the generations of today or whatever like basically anyone is under the age of about forty or fifty or so i think that they could probably deal with it i mean i do not think it 

Recording: (442/ 2140) 
you know i mean i liked earl bruse and i uh waited on him a couple times at a restaurant i worked at he was the nicest man and when they did that i do not know if you know about that when they fired him the david before the michigan game for having a nine to three season three years in a row they fired him the day before that game 

Recording: (443/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (444/ 2140) 
i do not know trial stuff i also would not mind doing um since i have a business career i would not mind doing uh um some sort of financial laws stuff like being a uh lawyer for somebody wants to sue the crap out of another corporation i will have plenty of money in that i want to be an angulation uh yeah yeah one giant wants to be 

Recording: (445/ 2140)

we do have a mutual thing and young people they are you know there is so many different infatuations to start with that they get blinded and they get you know off course and everything else and and then it does not stay the same i mean it is all exciting and and all that and then uh you know i think it is kind of 

Recording: (447/ 2140) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (448/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (449/ 2140)

Recording: (453/ 2140) 
yeah it is my daughter yeah um-hum 

Recording: (454/ 2140) 
though and we had like tapes we listened to a native speaker so you got really good really quick 

Recording: (455/ 2140) 
um 

Recording: (456/ 2140)

basically they decided to build a new building adjacent to the church taxon and we they asked the choir for input 

Recording: (462/ 2140) 
um i i think it fills it is niche you know i mean i mean wexner has a niche and the and the museum has a niche and um i think it fills it very well 

Recording: (463/ 2140) 
um what happened was we know see one of the people on our committee teaches in the math department here

if uh you know you come from a situation like that that does not mean you have to be like that do you know what i mean kind of 

Recording: (468/ 2140) 
i think so i think so if you are willing uh you know anybody who is willing to put out the effort i mean you do have to you know you have to sell yourself there is you know you are not gonna just sit around and wait to be discovered but um if you put out the effort i really do not i do not think there is that kind of that kind of discrimination anymore 

Recording: (469/ 2140) 
yeah that and i think uh i am a firm believer that uh little subtleties like that to yourself are much better than looking the mirror and going look at them hips and you go this way and you go i am getting a gut and you know it is like that is so negative to your would you tell your mom that you know 

Recording: (470/ 2140)

and that is what we did and so he is just like my own too now i go and volunteer at he is in kindergarten i go and volunteer in his classroom too so it is kind of like i hope i get to do this forever 

Recording: (484/ 2140) 
and they do everything they possibly can to make me happy and it is like um my my oldest girl she we are expecting our first grandchild here within a couple weeks and and she and i see each other all the time my daughter who goes chose to live at home because she just said it was just a better situation for her and uh um it is not that these girls are not independent and can not do it on their their megan could my second daughter could have lived on her own from the time she was twelve i mean she is just very very right 

Recording: (485/ 2140) 
sort uh essay for for a test and um but the way that i would grade those would be pretty scientific i think you know i would come up with a rubric and i would say you you need to have you need to mention certain things and i will give certain points for your mentioning certain things yeah i have i have never been a i have never been a teacher who is had to assign her grade creative writing yknow i am not sure i would know how to do that yeah 

Recording: (486/ 2140) 
you know talk to her but people do not when i was fourteen i did not care what anybody told me i was gonna do it no matter what 

Recording: (487/ 2140) 
yeah i think i got really good um i have actually been sitting thinking about it like what departments in the school were good and which ones were not um the foreign languages really they have immersion classes from like a second level 

Recording: (488/ 2140) 
i am raising the best way i can 

Recording: (489/ 2140) 
uh it counts if you are touching the ground or if something that you are sitting on is touching 

Recording: (490/ 2140) 
um actually i was over there when all of that happened but of course it was all over the papers and you know i think i mean i i do not know it was like really here i can imagine but i mean there especially they really focused on um not columbine but the one with the the younger kids in arkansas was it did you before i was there for both of those but you know in the first one you know they they put the picture of the little kid in combat gear holding the gun everywhere 

Recording: (491/ 2140) 
let us watch seven to nine 

Recording: (492/ 2140) 
yeah it was real fun real fun i just quickly got him kicked out of the dorm he still does not know it was me but yeah he still does not know it was me but he and i are still on speaking terms with just which is fascinating um but uh you know i mean our first day i walked in he said hey i am tom you ever smoked pot before i was like no he said hey we got a whole year together and and i am directly quoting that is the first thing he said to me that is the first thing 

Recording: (493/ 2140) 
and uh the second tornado it was not as bad i mean as we was driving up after he uh ripped me off and he said well i am taking your sorry ass back to columbus and i said okay go for it i am just sitting there smiling all the way up knowing knowing what he did not know we get the ten and i you know weather is kind of bad there too i am like hey man slow down you know you do not have any windshield wip in the middle of this rainstorm 

Recording: (494/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (495/ 2140) 
hope so yeah 

Recording: (496/ 2140) 
and so i think it gets driven home i think the media does that in a lot of places they pick something that is sensational and keep they are making it even more sensational like when uh uh john kennedy died 

Recording: (497/ 2140) 
it is really beautiful out there we like we like mountains and you know walking around uh we got married in lake taho which is really beautiful 

Recording: (498/ 2140) 
i 

Recording: (499/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (500/ 2140) 
he is a picky eater which he is yep he he does not like everything 

Recording: (501/ 2140) 
like it is everything pretty i mean like basic stuff that you it would be it like you know like oh lazarus or something like that you know or i were a bunch of them places you know like electronics uh appliances uh uh 

Recording: (502/ 2140) 
if there any germans in there i will bet they scared 

Recording: (503/ 2140) 
and i would just hear things 

Recording: (504/ 2140) 
um-hum me too 

Recording: (505/ 2140) 
um i am a luthorn and a lot of what he says about everyone going to hell 

Recording: (506/ 2140) 
as back into and to high school 

Recording: (507/ 2140) 
um neither one of them is married or have kids uh my sister does has a boyfriend for probably like three years or so and there is talk about him like are virgin kids and stuff like that with them 

Recording: (508/ 2140) 
well it was you know the crime you can not really stop and other things that happen just you know too much partying around i mean that is why i left full of avenue because i could not you know but you know just everybody on the neighbors being loud and everything my mom is older so she can not really put up with that and 

Recording: (509/ 2140) 
like i am not i am not really sure like how they how the interview works to become a teacher um i do not know i think it is like a lot of times they are really desperate to find people and so they really just take whoever i mean they are lucky enough to even have a body to fill the this place and they are doing well enough i mean the kids are learning material i mean sort of i mean i mean i it is working well enough i guess 

Recording: (510/ 2140) 
north 

Recording: (511/ 2140) 
oh that goes with the disorder they know they know when who is button to push and when not to push a button and how far they can go and you know where the line is and they push you always that is why teachers they uh they drive the teacher up the wall 

Recording: (512/ 2140) 
i think society as today up today is less tolerant of uh a lot of things that they see where people getting by with stuff you know and they are more vocal well about it as opposed to being violent about it back in the sixties and stuff you know uh not here but you know down south there people still getting home and stuff you know for being a black or something and uh you know there are bad blacks and there is bad whites too you know so but 

Recording: (513/ 2140) 
well 

Recording: (514/ 2140) 
i 

Recording: (515/ 2140) 
you know so you can use all those opportunities to show your kid what not to do 

Recording: (516/ 2140) 
well i mean to me the whole thing is wrong regardless of if you are guilty or innocent there to me there is work worse things i would think than than dying you know you you like i know on real the guy who killed yet sacramento he got locked up and he is not allowed to see it because it um under jewish law you can not kill 

Recording: (517/ 2140) 
and now it is our turn to deal with the issues we see our parents we see this generation that all these things they are still popular so we do not look down on the sixty right i think the sixty son like a pretty fun time to live i will get into politics in a second um but those things are popularized but no we can not do it anymore because we have got all these problems s 

Recording: (518/ 2140) 
because they would not let them when i was there 

Recording: (519/ 2140) 
word 

Recording: (520/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (521/ 2140)

yeah he is teaching us uh system five so its just funny 

Recording: (523/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (524/ 2140) 
uh i i think i like that how it is kept with a sort of a tension and it is not like you know i mean they are not completely thrown together like uh belana and tom which i do not like that at all 

Recording: (525/ 2140) 
and he could not have any kind of caffeine otherwise he would get the shakes and he took all kinds of pills 

Recording: (526/ 2140) 
fifty two yeah 

Recording: (527/ 2140) 
oh exactly i am planning on just staying in the house if i can or what not yeah oh yeah yeah i know i mean we are gonna get some water and what not because you do not know people might turn things off like you said 

Recording: (528/ 2140) 
microsoft linux eh i do not know i think linux will be around forever just because it is such a stable system it is so good and yeah and mackintosh will stay around forever just because mackintosh is invincible huh um-hum um-hum after the big hype of the imac and it did not do as good as it nearly as good as they thought it was gonna do if 

Recording: (529/ 2140) 
um i do not know do you know anything about unix 

Recording: (530/ 2140) 
and um i mean i know i did not think that much about it at all well i am not doing anything else why not um and um uh i mean i mean it i do not i just seems kind of silly to legally have levels i mean either either you are gonna go do it the hard way or you are not 

Recording: (531/ 2140) 
wow 

Recording: (532/ 2140) 
the problem is lack of commitment lack of commitment and not saying hey there is a niche for you you can not be a mail oh yeah you wanna do the operation i can not be feeling yeah he wanted to well why not be happy what you are god made you what you are why not make you the complete person you are and not strive for something you can not be 

Recording: (533/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (534/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (535/ 2140) 
i went to o u for about three months but i was just got out of school you know what it is 

Recording: (536/ 2140) 
oh really i was like whoa milk and twizzlers 

Recording: (537/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (538/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (539/ 2140) 
sure north it is in the short north but um it is so much fun it is absolutely so much fun because it is really weird um you normally do not get hit on by girls when you go to a regular dance club but when you go to axis you do not get hit on my girls you get hit on my guys i dance with acoustics and i have had i had like seven guys come up here in one night and they are just like can can you like can you do that for me and 

Recording: (540/ 2140) 
that ran down oh a hundred two hundred yards from the gun position so we took off down there 

Recording: (541/ 2140) 
oh 

Recording: (542/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (543/ 2140) 
i think there might be but i think most of them are a dying breed they are the older citizens um many in my generation uh that there is probably be because i am i am the early baby boom i am i am the first of the baby boom uh and that is when the woman is movement started and many men there still have not always accepted that so there there might be a problem there but for the the the the generations even the later baby boom generations behind me when i talked to them i talked to uh high school students or even young college students 

Recording: (544/ 2140) 
no no they did not um they did not pay for grading or preparing your classes or or researching anything so right but but still even though it was real uh very much underpaid job i i liked it when i did it um i liked the introduction to the arts class because i had to develop my own curriculum for it right they had a when they told me i i 

Recording: (545/ 2140) 
yknow 

Recording: (546/ 2140) 
beginning of the end yep i am growing upper arlington not far yeah it really those five miles makes it different stuff like because i yeah because i live on campus 

Recording: (547/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (548/ 2140) 
well it is not that there is been too much growth i mean growth is good but now they need to stop 

Recording: (549/ 2140) 
well it is not it is not how it is put into effect the law it is how it is enforced you know you do not just say well you know little johnny stuck his finger in a pie and you can not do that anymore and you know the more the more security you are gonna have over that pie the more he is gonna want it so and going into the gun thing it is pretty much nobody is winning game i mean you make stricter laws 

Recording: (550/ 2140) 
and so you had 

Recording: (551/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (552/ 2140) 
the direction is being or they are being pushed 

Recording: (553/ 2140) 
um they just got different beliefs she believes all i mean like one thing she believes all men will cheat 

Recording: (554/ 2140) 
yeah much too fast for me you know uh 

Recording: (555/ 2140) 
but it is not gonna work i mean they if you are around people i mean number one they are around their parents and their siblings and that socializing you go to church or to the library or wherever i mean you are around people and you are around children and they get to have socialization if you wanna call it whatever and i think from everything that i have read and seen you know 

Recording: (556/ 2140) 
there is apartments above them 

Recording: (557/ 2140) 
i would not 

Recording: (558/ 2140) 
um-hum where from 

Recording: (559/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (560/ 2140) 
just carrying around a gun and shooting someone 

Recording: (561/ 2140) 
he has not he has not questioned me like that but i see a lot of things coming out he is doing more in mine he is been doing things a lot more differently than my daughter because my daughter was away at school and he he is with us every day stays home and everybody does not want to stay on campus and uh it is he does things voluntarily we do not have to coach he is working with a lot of other people i mean they what he is been weird with coached with and so forth it is somewhat embedded he sees that 

Recording: (562/ 2140) 
well think a little bit of safer idea than uh eliminating guns because you know there is always gonna be weapons out there instead of eliminating the problem you know more centralize it make it a national law that you have to be a certain age you have a certain time period for your background checks and whatever else kind of record finding they need make sure you are 

Recording: (563/ 2140) 
commonor sixty four is they have heard of it but they really do not know what a brilliant system it was at it is in and it is initial stage and it just got pulled over because you know something better came out something better will come out than windows microsoft will eventually go under she is just gonna take a while oh yeah oh yeah i do not i give it probably about six or seven years before for before somebody comes out with a system that is just as good as 

Recording: (564/ 2140) 
and just just shows the ignorance in so many people you know and said that really still bothers me there is there is still so much of that going on you know oh 

Recording: (565/ 2140) 
um 

Recording: (566/ 2140) 
factory there is a there and not really there is all sorts of there is all sorts of of of of um industry in the mansfield area but there is a lot of it no actually most of it most of it stayed most of it stayed it is been it is been there for alio yeah we have got the mansfield state reformatory where shoshink redemption was where shoshink redemption was recorded yep yep 

Recording: (567/ 2140) 
names control all the all the kids went into that just so intensively and they were supposed to be real good guys but i mean what uh the visual was pretty miserable in my opinion they wore these masks and hoods and 

Recording: (568/ 2140) 
yeah he uses a lot of difference lawyers towards gay people 

Recording: (569/ 2140) 
developed over time uh but it is far more socialistic uh but 

Recording: (570/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (571/ 2140) 
yes 

Recording: (572/ 2140) 
people who want them 

Recording: (573/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (574/ 2140) 
yeah they do their trains are so cool i love those 

Recording: (575/ 2140) 
and then once a month we will have a leadership module which is uh the business ethics part and you know set goal setting and that type thing and then once a month we will just have like tomatoes pizza and like just just discuss basic and just general things like events coming up we had we planned the flowers mirror field last weekend and the weekend before was it two i do not know i can not wait for it to start just because i want to watch it on tv i am like i planted those 

Recording: (576/ 2140) 
yeah well they are that one you know the white i mean you can not even have my stuff in your car anymore i do not know 

Recording: (577/ 2140) 
plus the mental health aspect of it and everything 

Recording: (578/ 2140) 
no it is very much so 

Recording: (579/ 2140) 
uh i do not think i would want my kid to go to daycare crazy 

Recording: (580/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (581/ 2140) 
that he remembers she he remembers the stepfathers and and that kind of thing and just not a good job 

Recording: (582/ 2140) 
long period of time 

Recording: (583/ 2140) 
this poor 

Recording: (584/ 2140) 
uh and they are less hyper about like you know bad things for people to do you know the the drinking the smoking they are just not as strict about basically 

Recording: (585/ 2140) 
i cant see it 

Recording: (586/ 2140) 
people that are doing you think why do you why are we hiring these guys you know what do they what do they think 

Recording: (587/ 2140) 
you did i 

Recording: (588/ 2140) 
really 

Recording: (589/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (590/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (591/ 2140) 
i think it should be my way and i think i think you know i think the material should be there i think it should you know dealt with in a calm and reasonable way and i think it should be accessible to the kids yes 

Recording: (592/ 2140) 
i guess so i hope that they can keep the school somehow for kids and but it will not be him right it 

Recording: (593/ 2140) 
yeah i got a son he is a senior daughter by 

Recording: (594/ 2140) 
so 

Recording: (595/ 2140) 
so they get more buying power if they go there okay 

Recording: (596/ 2140) 
i you had women that were working before you had women working before but self discipline is a big deal on family that is part of it self discipline making things too easy for us oh we can not do it without it you ever you ever tried to work for something i mean you really struggled to to achieve something did it mean more to you than something that was given to you tell me 

Recording: (597/ 2140) 
there is literally ya know hundred of library publications uh and it is a problem that librarians are facing all the time they can not keep up 

Recording: (598/ 2140) 
i i moved into the dorms late september last fall 

Recording: (599/ 2140) 
no sunlight you know and they do not give him they keep it warm and then he is not allowed cheats or razers or you know other than an electric raiser so he can not kill himself so you are just stuck you there is nothing you could do all day for forty years or however until he naturally does and that to me would be like that to me is actually like that has to be worse like just that agony in that and you i think you would have to go and saying like there is really so much you i would ask for board games or something but like you can not do not even hear a human voice 

Recording: (600/ 2140) 
word 

Recording: (601/ 2140) 
i have got nothing against christianity but i got something against the way it was brought here 

Recording: (602/ 2140) 
there is uh you know just uh it was i had three spiritual leaders tell me that a great gift came with that that there was it was no accident it was supposed to happen and uh there is a word called synchronicity 

Recording: (603/ 2140) 
we are at least every other year we are out there 

Recording: (604/ 2140) 
uh-huh uh-huh 

Recording: (605/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (606/ 2140) 
mean there is nothing bad about them or anything with they 

Recording: (607/ 2140) 
did your husband like that 

Recording: (608/ 2140) 
uh six years ago 

Recording: (609/ 2140) 
and it only took um less than two months 

Recording: (610/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (611/ 2140) 
they have this entrance and there these trees on the inside of the house they are just growing down and everything and they are like crystals and they have this one room that looks like a sphinx and then they have um this backyard that looks all you know cute old england it is just really really cool house 

Recording: (612/ 2140) 
word 

Recording: (613/ 2140) 
columbus rate showed that i mean he crossed gender lines he crossed um party lines he crossed over into all of the city and winning even dorothy teater is precinct which surprised me you know and not and not by just a little small margin i think was two hundred and some votes which is pretty substantial 

Recording: (614/ 2140) 
um-hum um-hum 

Recording: (615/ 2140) 
one of the hardest 

Recording: (616/ 2140) 
it is just been my experience uh unfortunately um i hope it gets better but uh like i said i have not been uh told them my degree matters by any employer uh contrary to what the news tells you and what people will tell you oh go get that college degree uh you know uh people told me soon as i got out of college then i needed a masters uh 

Recording: (617/ 2140) 
so i pretty much um it is not stressful at all i i it is really easy it is not challenging 

Recording: (618/ 2140) 
we are getting more fun stuff all the time but predominantly it still got way too much cow town personality 

Recording: (619/ 2140) 
i mean there are gays in congress there are gays in the military as long as people do not know they they do not feel threatened see and and i i i do not understand that mindset i do not i do not know why a man feels threatened by having a gay near them um i have a couple of gay friends and and one of my friends always says um you know does every man like every woman he sees is he attracted every woman and you know wanna go to bed with every woman you know what makes a man think that just because 

Recording: (620/ 2140) 
really 

Recording: (621/ 2140) 
to have else 

Recording: (622/ 2140) 
and it is really old and i mean it is just ridiculously like seventies just ridiculous and he is giving them out but the only thing is if you take one you finish like you have to um install a disc drive 

Recording: (623/ 2140) 
they are confused i i do not know that saying home is for everyone and i do not think parenting is for everyone and it really makes me when i see somebody you know well we just wonder 

Recording: (624/ 2140) 
yeah so that worked out uh so i really had not dated for a long time and then i started dating again and what is weird is you almost go right back and to the patterns because you are so scared you can be alone you see yourself going i can be but this person and you know in your head this person is not for you and then luckily um indirectly i met my husband 

Recording: (625/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (626/ 2140) 
yeah eighty four 

Recording: (627/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (628/ 2140) 
and they have honors classes which are separate and they are supposed to be with like better faculty and um smaller class size and a little more challenging 

Recording: (629/ 2140) 
right but how old is your kid 

Recording: (630/ 2140) 
we were already writing cursive already that is all she writes in now i mean it seemed like they were teaching it then maybe might be learning some of yeah she is fractions she is doing fractions she is doing percentages already in second grade and i thought we were one plus one too you know in second grade it is just seems like they are three years ahead so 

Recording: (631/ 2140) 
yeah i do not 

Recording: (632/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (633/ 2140) 
uh civil rights only went so far they have not corrected the wrongs in the past they have not uh created uh uh a a sense in our society that anyone can achieve like the american dream in in my opinion is an absolute lie 

Recording: (634/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (635/ 2140) 
i live in albany therefore i am cool 

Recording: (636/ 2140) 
franklin park south is wonderful too or franklin park out east is beautiful too off of east broad street now that is volunteer also their guards are volunteer on a grand scale that is where the uh conservatory is right 

Recording: (637/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (638/ 2140) 
yes um-hum yep 

Recording: (639/ 2140) 
yeah why not take advantage of this yeah why not take advantage of that so 

Recording: (640/ 2140) 
because it is hard for us to deal with 

Recording: (641/ 2140) 
yeah just get out there and have fun and then like we lived uh probably like four days a week i know i do not look like it but but i go with them and have a good time so 

Recording: (642/ 2140) 
sister in law is one of them she is just too stupid 

Recording: (643/ 2140) 
no i do not fear none of the kids 

Recording: (644/ 2140) 
just seems like a waste of legislation money 

Recording: (645/ 2140) 
well according the government she would have 

Recording: (646/ 2140) 
that once you filter it through something it looks different but previous to that yeah there is a lot there there is way too much shared experience to to gloss over effectively so when she said look if you never listen to anything else that i say you will listen to this you need to go to europe i was like okay i will go to europe 

Recording: (647/ 2140) 
uh she did i she my ex wife did uh i would have preferred her to continue going to school but she had some problems with some students and stuff and 

Recording: (648/ 2140) 
um i i see it as a problem and if i if i if i were african american i would i would not like to see it simply because uh you know it is it it is a a child not being brought up in his you know in his tradition but on the other hand i would hate to i hate to see a child left in foster care or in an orphanage when he could have a home and um i think uh parents who are willing to a 

Recording: (649/ 2140) 
you ask if he is okay for us to do it and uh now with her uh i can have dishes out there in the uh that are left there for from breakfast and maybe a lunch and uh she he will walk out there and say well grandpa how come you did are not done and then she turns around and walks away hey hey that try you uh-huh and and she may think 

Recording: (650/ 2140) 
and you are not being recorded now 

Recording: (651/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (652/ 2140) 
but why would you make stricter gun laws when you can not even enforce your traffic laws 

Recording: (653/ 2140) 
that is right and in other words it is so much me anymore instead of us and we 

Recording: (654/ 2140) 
huh 

Recording: (655/ 2140) 
getting her someplace stable 

Recording: (656/ 2140) 
word 

Recording: (657/ 2140)

Recording: (756/ 2140) 
and to learn anything it had to be the same thing over and over and over again until he got it right 

Recording: (757/ 2140) 
again they set different roles 

Recording: (758/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (759/ 2140) 
they said well since you are getting that i will cut cut your pay back to what you would normally draw under apprenticeship program

Recording: (772/ 2140) 
yeah and yeah so i 

Recording: (773/ 2140) 
well i would i would sit down and talk to her like you know if you want to have sex if you really want to have sex you should get on some kind of birth control 

Recording: (774/ 2140) 
you know we my husband and i were just talking about this i was saying i am not in for the you know george oral nineteen eighty four and big brother syndrome at all um my ideal situation would be that somebody decides who should have kids and who is not but i do not think god is gonna come down and do that so you know what i mean we can not really decide that but to be 

Recording: (775/ 2140) 
so it is still just sitting down on my computer sits next to it um the only thing is if take it down you can only have half a desk 

Recording: (776/ 2140) 
yeah i have lived with my mom since then 

Recording: (777/ 2140)

and i would definitely keep a eye out and you know figure out what is going on you know 

Recording: (782/ 2140) 
and i mean it is basically anytime i have free i mean it is not like i have a set schedule when i have to work and things like that it is just whenever i feel like i have to do it

Recording: (797/ 2140) 
whether it is over exaggerated or you know none of us grew up shooting people in this you know we do not own a fire arm but we played with guns and played cow all these ames and so i just wonder whether this is really you know but society is a lot different now 

Recording: (798/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (799/ 2140) 
shopping around for a new attorney and it took me about seven before um pardon me seven attorneys before i found one that was adequate in terms of knowledge of head injury and brain injury because his father was a nurse surgeon and uh he had experience in extra he is and uh bringing up the uh the differences uh in the realities of of a brain injury

Recording: (805/ 2140) 
you know which when you should is it that are we putting it um 

Recording: (806/ 2140) 
my brother knows about it and my mother necessarily wants it in my family that are even aware of it so because we just do not wanna be bothered with a lot of questions 

Recording: (807/ 2140) 
oh understanding 

Recording: (808/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (809/ 2140) 
uh-huh

Recording: (813/ 2140) 
so 

Recording: (814/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (815/ 2140) 
word word 

Recording: (816/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (817/ 2140) 
yeah and and and everybody is gonna associate with people that they feel comfortable with so you know and uh fortunately i was that guy this guy in particular was the center for the football team as he grew up older you know uh he realized that he was not as big as important as the uh he would blow out his knee for uh o u you know uh but i went to i went to school with larry hunter who is the uh basketball coach for uh o u now and uh word word 

Recording: (818/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (819/ 2140) 
did not make it into the history books yeah 

Recording: (820/ 2140) 
that um encompasses the uh theory that all things happen for a reason even though it seems like it is chaos even though it seems like it is an accident ah there is a flow of spirit in this world things or moving at a place that they are supposed to move at and things happen and death is part of life physical death and that is 

Recording: (821/ 2140) 
your husband is believe it or not uh they are not really i would not call them neat freaks but um we tease them because my parents in her live within a couple months of each other in dublin and you have take off your shoes when you go which is really it is amazing how good their carpet looks 

Recording: (822/ 2140) 
better had start on development so 

Recording: (823/ 2140) 
no because they are gonna learn that on their own um i i personally think that it is a choice i do not think you are born that way because i i have friends that are homosexual and um you know what i do not believe in what they are doing but i do not do everything right every day so i still love them and they are my friends and blah blah blah because but i have also known people that were that way and now are heterosexual and are much happier and they realized that it was just a choice they 

Recording: (824/ 2140) 
yeah they are 

Recording: (825/ 2140) 
i am not agreeing with my grandma seems she seems to think okay maybe but if you put a discount store in there i would love it that is when she said i was like okay 

Recording: (826/ 2140) 
right wow 

Recording: (827/ 2140) 
so yeah 

Recording: (828/ 2140) 
wish they could 

Recording: (829/ 2140) 
oh man i wish i knew what to buy this week 

Recording: (830/ 2140) 
on to a house but it is just more time consuming than i think i am ready 

Recording: (831/ 2140) 
get it from us so 

Recording: (832/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (833/ 2140) 
oh yeah they they 

Recording: (834/ 2140) 
yeah and yeah and i would not do that i if i was you know had no children and 

Recording: (835/ 2140) 
so but that is you know i ended up settling the attorney got most of the money well little i had i invested some and then i made some bad investments when i went medication and uh you know blew it you know so that was my responsibility my fault but uh you know how it was just ah years of pent up frustration and then just 

Recording: (836/ 2140) 
um-hum yeah 

Recording: (837/ 2140) 
that is perfect 

Recording: (838/ 2140) 
yeah just one concert 

Recording: (839/ 2140) 
and i do not think that it it is just executed properly so i would almost rather have it not at all 

Recording: (840/ 2140) 
i do not i do not hate them 

Recording: (841/ 2140) 
women really do not need to sweat lodge but it is there for them and they do participate um 

Recording: (842/ 2140) 
oh okay well the reason i asked was a lot it seems to me a lot of the impetus for going to church or going back to church for people is when their kid gets old enough to go to sunday school starting asking questions about religion and you are saying well i suppose i could answer all these but yeah 

Recording: (843/ 2140) 
um no english 

Recording: (844/ 2140) 
do not think so 

Recording: (845/ 2140) 
um 

Recording: (846/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (847/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (848/ 2140) 
part of it was just being stupid but it was down around mountverton area and uh got great little money but i was not hurt 

Recording: (849/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (850/ 2140) 
i would say and then i would also say that you know uh because a a a number of reasons that people do not vote for school levies now is because they do not have kids in the schools you know but education is foundation of a democracy and if you do not have an educated citizenry uh your democracy could go down the drain um that was why thomas jeffers found it so many schools or you know that the university of virginia and believed in education you know because he said without an educated citizenry you will not understand the issues you know but 

Recording: (851/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (852/ 2140) 
boy 

Recording: (853/ 2140) 
hum um 

Recording: (854/ 2140) 
groups and different groups but i can not help with thinking that if it was bad enough that you would do something like that that you know it had to have been more than just you know sort of normal shocks versus whatever so i think it should be more i do not know i mean even you know i went to a private 

Recording: (855/ 2140) 
and you know you would have a hard thing there but then if you teach the teachers that they are not gonna be quiet and they are not gonna you know um look at this flattery 

Recording: (856/ 2140)

Recording: (857/ 2140) 
it sucked 

Recording: (858/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (859/ 2140)

Recording: (863/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (864/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (865/ 2140)

Recording: (870/ 2140) 
i i at one time i kind of wanted to be a teacher and everything but course that would have been i am forty nine so i would have been probably about twenty four i would have about twenty five years then so i would be ready get the heck out anyway you know 

Recording: (871/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (872/ 2140) 
you know so basically oh yeah it might work but to me it is kind of stupid you know because what you are saying is we are gonna take this law and we are really gonna stick you on this law but the hell with all the other really fair 

Recording: (873/ 2140) 
long it was uh back in the sixties so you know 

Recording: (874/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (875/ 2140) 
i mean i do not think they should get rid of it for polaris thing but you know there is plenty of malls to go to if that is okay it is not a big deal to me to tell you truth no actually i live i live closer i live eastland or 

Recording: (876/ 2140) 
i remember it being that is a pretty positive thing for me i was never upset about the fact that they were not together because they all both gave me a lot of attention but um about i think i was maybe five or six my mom moved into apartment in german village 

Recording: (877/ 2140) 
yeah my brother well he is the oldest oldest but two sisters pretty much all the ones i have really care about two sisters and they are husbands 

Recording: (878/ 2140) 
more expensive so everyone has a lot less and here it is like everything is so relatively inexpensive that it is like you know picture frames or something there might be you know twenty five dollars one so you buy one here oh you know they are five dollars apiece let us buy five you know 

Recording: (879/ 2140) 
yep 

Recording: (880/ 2140) 
um-hum you got it across the street you know four lane highway and you sit there going they 

Recording: (881/ 2140) 
around you but at night it is pretty fun man you just floor it and fly right through the middle of the downtown um improvements i would just like you i would just say the yeah i mean this place is dirty 

Recording: (882/ 2140) 
yeah well i think chiropractors would be more popular for the same type of reason yeah huh 

Recording: (883/ 2140) 
word 

Recording: (884/ 2140) 
as he was speaking and uh and as he started to speak i realized too another thing that i really feel has a tremendous impression on how we as people are doing here but how the politicians are because the world old in essence is getting smaller because the communication has gotten better and all these other countries and us are just like oh one country anymore or something and i think that is had a tremendous influence also on our politics and on we as a people 

Recording: (885/ 2140) 
see tomorrow i mean hold them feel the warmth of the body uh hear the conversation quietly uh then uh hearing okay time to get out of here i know it was a vigorous thing but a pleasant sort of remark these kind i got to elaborate i could write a whole book on that on this is on the answer your uh but it is these kinds of things are very elementary really they are very elementary i guess to 

Recording: (886/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (887/ 2140) 
right right he would go for weeks he would get mad at me and that would speak to me when i was growing up for a week or two at a time my mother would say please nance i changed my name when i went to college i just decided i am out of here i am everything is gone and so she would say oh nancy please just talk to your father just for just for my sake please and i would think i am the child here i should not have to be the one to make peace in this family if he does not want talk to me i do not need him i do not have to talk to him 

Recording: (888/ 2140) 
well it is sort of like the sociology of like cliques you know like how how that develops like how people like some people seek to like fit in like like the that is a real strong uh like 

Recording: (889/ 2140) 
really yeah i do not feel old at all i mean i you know a lot of people think wow you should know what you wanna do or you know and and i guess there is different phases like uh masters hierarchy what is that the um the hierarchy of needs master master oh anyway 

Recording: (890/ 2140) 
let him beat south beat right now but 

Recording: (891/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (892/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (893/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (894/ 2140) 
well it was both really because there is kids lived there since i lived there i was thirteen years ago and being that long in the same neighborhood just did not really get it with me 

Recording: (895/ 2140) 
yeah from the strike yeah yeah um actually a lot of our stuff did pretty well while we were off so did make you feel as needed as you wanna be you know yeah you know we got a lot of our buildings up and running before they went on strike and i think the bosses knew this was coming so lot of the air conditioning was already running by then 

Recording: (896/ 2140) 
yeah exactly i know 

Recording: (897/ 2140) 
yeah um-hum 

Recording: (898/ 2140) 
always been my feeling and and uh i try to be fair in the way i agreed um you know it is i try to be as objective as i can sometimes i i because i think it is important that people learn how to write i would ask all my classes to write an essay or short 

Recording: (899/ 2140) 
you know 

Recording: (900/ 2140) 
yes 

Recording: (901/ 2140) 
that is pretty extreme 

Recording: (902/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (903/ 2140) 
gosh 

Recording: (904/ 2140) 
their i d is i mean the guys are trying to look older the girls are trying to look younger 

Recording: (905/ 2140) 
well then they had uh after that they had the lottery number and that was not if you were hot you know if you got your number was picked i mean i do not know what should be worse knowing that you are gonna get a notice and being able to prepare for it or uh because i have had friends that gotten uh numbers and everything you know and and getting a high number and sitting there and saying oh my god so 

Recording: (906/ 2140) 
um it was just yeah i guess the mafia was a big problem they just take over everything and they they do not pay their workers and most people are not mafia so do not get paid 

Recording: (907/ 2140) 
but i do know my my my brother in law mentioned to his uh parents is that gosh what a sacrifice you guys did for us and he is just turned fifty well for one thing they probably did a lot of sacrifice and when you sacrifice you become you make you more humble 

Recording: (908/ 2140) 
uh the younger kids would not think anything about it 

Recording: (909/ 2140) 
uh a type of lifestyle and that lifestyle is gone everybody is independent everybody is going their own ways and if you happen to be lucky enough to find somebody that is looking same direction you are and as equally as independent then it might it might work but um i you know and who knows why each person gets to i mean each one of them was an individual situation and uh 

Recording: (910/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (911/ 2140) 
um-hum from the watch towers yeah you got like you know looking up and saying you know somebody is you know got their sights on me yeah it is because that is a it is like you know like you know that is like the world war two stuff you know there is like remains i am sure but it is like you get to see the wall it is like there i mean i am sure there is like the there is uh uh the from what i understand there was like 

Recording: (912/ 2140) 
word 

Recording: (913/ 2140) 
so how ever this works out you know i do not know i just i am just like okay she just says i just want to get it over with and see now she you know 

Recording: (914/ 2140) 
really 

Recording: (915/ 2140) 
to be close i did not have to drive 

Recording: (916/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (917/ 2140) 
see that is great though 

Recording: (918/ 2140) 
um so i mean basically my opinion on that is just leave it up to them i mean if they wanna take the risks obviously they know 

Recording: (919/ 2140) 
if you if if if you say bye bye from those unscrupulous business people and say oh gee these guys get me a credit eh what happens to that person that files bankruptcy oh file bankruptcy okay i will do something else get next next time 

Recording: (920/ 2140) 
why would he think that is happening right now because i think that i do not know what the divorce statistics have been recently but i do see that more people are getting married are staying married because those that would do not those that would have gotten a divorce they are not bothering to get married to begin with they are just living together and yet they separate so what and i that 

Recording: (921/ 2140) 
yeah and it it has the least amount of people which is kind of neat as far as tourism so 

Recording: (922/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (923/ 2140) 
i am looking for a part time job as we speak i have been like doing temporary on it off uh the thing with that is you could work you know for four five months and then nothing and then like that so right now i am looking for something permanent 

Recording: (924/ 2140) 
you know just experiencing someone for who they are and so she is 

Recording: (925/ 2140) 
couple restaurants or something but i mean it is it is different when you think of other cities you know it is more of like a downtown is where you go to hang out but here it is like campus and he or more of a 

Recording: (926/ 2140) 
it was just so i did not object to that one at all 

Recording: (927/ 2140) 
that that would be seriously fun but uh it depends if you work industry you get money 

Recording: (928/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (929/ 2140) 
really 

Recording: (930/ 2140) 
and they were just wild you know i just ran every minute and i took it as a substitute and did not know from day to day you know whether it was gonna keep it i finally had to say i can not do this twenty seven kindergarteners i am sorry i can not do this by myself 

Recording: (931/ 2140) 
um me or 

Recording: (932/ 2140) 
yeah drugs right yeah yeah so that is what she is interested in right now she is looking to see if she could find some place to work this summer you believe it is just a day a week and some clinic or something just to to see what is goes on day to day 

Recording: (933/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (934/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (935/ 2140) 
uh it is bishop reedy is it you know you know you are not from around there is a it is a catholic school over on the west side 

Recording: (936/ 2140) 
you know and i just told them what has to do with my belief systems i hear in violation of the first amendment you know so and then they realized that i was not stupid so oh you know they just made things more and more difficult for me you know so i just decided uh since they were not gonna change i was just gonna leave you know but so it is yeah it is it is a hard way and choose to walk uh if you are an idealistic person it is i mean just more so 

Recording: (937/ 2140) 
is it any worse than baseball cards or you know 

Recording: (938/ 2140) 
and he said do not divorce more acceptable divorce should never be acceptable 

Recording: (939/ 2140) 
yeah i had a cousin that went on she she was in school for that and um as you could tell i like to do office work i 

Recording: (940/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (941/ 2140) 
yeah that is how we get so much money he says i will be paid this much and i will be given this many had this much minimum per day or i am not working for you and they usually say no no no we will not do that you know and then they will call back a week later okay we will take you he has some really good stories about that oh yeah just has qualifications he has qualifications in the businesses and also without unix which is 

Recording: (942/ 2140) 
hum 

Recording: (943/ 2140) 
whole out more places to live it seems like everywhere i turn there is construction and and you know you go down one road and then you wait a couple years if you do not go in that area yeah and it is all changed it looks all different so and that is mainly like looking up bethel and three fifteen or things like that 

Recording: (944/ 2140) 
you know he was in oh yeah they both worked during college and i guess my dad was on the g i bill after the war so that is how he got in here and had to work some part time work to get his degree um-hum it is it is just east broad street just franklin park conservative 

Recording: (945/ 2140) 
i mean that goes along with my customs and beliefs i mean we are gonna send our child i already know to parochial schools there is no way i am going to send him to a public school even my my husband is a um boy scout um leader and just listening to the boys there he he did a program last night on respect 

Recording: (946/ 2140) 
the ultimate would probably be a part time thing you know if but neither one of our positions offer any type of part time work we have some friends that do that where they only go two days a week or something which is they get a little bit of both the worlds so 

Recording: (947/ 2140) 
do i think they will oh yes i think they definitely will i think there is so much heavy uh political and financial well i am gonna reverse that statement uh there is so much heavy financial influence upon the political uh influence that it it is almost a fore gone conclusion and if it does not occur this within this year and uh there may be another vote in another year next a next election but i think that in fact it will go 

Recording: (948/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (949/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (950/ 2140) 
you know 

Recording: (951/ 2140) 
yeah that is why i am saying it 

Recording: (952/ 2140) 
yeah at uh yeah they they had two different uh articles in there uh about it well they had a big article uh back when uh it was it jessie jackson was down there or something years ago or something and uh he made it up for to try to let people know how power how most power is there there and everything but then you go to a lot of other extremes you know where you sit there and these people would not wanna live in columbus so 

Recording: (953/ 2140) 
i mean i think he is done some positive things that whole thing about um as far as like your student loans and being able to get it to help me you know and i think you know all those that as far as some of the issues go i think that that i feel pretty similar to the way he does um some of his foreign policy things i think i have gone pretty decently but i mean i think i do not i do not know i mean i i 

Recording: (954/ 2140) 
yeah from what i hear actually the like the emory and the um university or chicago you have to work really hard because they get all the kids who wish they would have gotten to harbert and then start you know try to make it up by working harder you get the actual harm for nobody works because they are like we already made it you know 

Recording: (955/ 2140) 
well that is an that is a tough one uh i remember when you know when we were we had you know some movies like like that but they were like the battery boys and stuff you know where that was you pretty much knew it was all fake anyway you know but and to me that is fake you know uh and i never really thought about when i was growing up that it was what was real and everything uh i always knew that by i there again you know by my dad being 

Recording: (956/ 2140) 
he he is a very he is a disappointment 

Recording: (957/ 2140) 
right right 

Recording: (958/ 2140) 
do this and will do this so he checked out the catholic school and they were organized that way and it just was a better better match for him and then when my daughter went to school it was just easier to take them to the same school and and that goes back to and reminded me of another thing i wanted to say about why they are disciplined and and behavior different in the catholic schools you are paying big you are paying bucks you know it is fourth out forty five hundred hours a year for us to send her to school hum 

Recording: (959/ 2140) 
yeah i figure right now i might as well take advantage of it 

Recording: (960/ 2140) 
yes 

Recording: (961/ 2140) 
businessman my dad and i have been screwing around with stocks for years um i have been in contact with a um day trading firm down in west virginia and they are starting an intern program sometime i do not even know when but if that if that opens up i will probably seriously consider going down to west virginia sent they are in richmond west virgin richmond i have i have been saying west virginia have not i they are in virginia sorry their their home base is in um richmond virginia 

Recording: (962/ 2140) 
year and then i went into the army in nineteen forty spring of nineteen forty one before pearl harbor and i was in a service for uh four and a half years in italy most of that time north africa and italy and uh i had met a i a girl before i went into service and so 

Recording: (963/ 2140) 
then when i found out there were so many openings in special ed so and then i found out later that speech therapy is a very good background for l d because a lot of these l d kids have language deficits and language problems they they can not you know like express themselves on paper or they do not he process correctly auditorally so that is the perfect background to work with l d kids i did not know i was doing that at the time but 

Recording: (964/ 2140) 
made a difference 

Recording: (965/ 2140) 
well that is great 

Recording: (966/ 2140) 
yes and no uh we are in boy scouts we got kicked out of it 

Recording: (967/ 2140) 
and uh well she the the people that own it are starting to build it up now but it is been like that it was the first apartment community uh in call it was built in thirty eight i guess 

Recording: (968/ 2140) 
um yeah people that live there and we have got the the you know the indian department stores right down there on high street and and couple of asian groceries but i was you know i i i do not know where they live i mean it it seems like for those stores to be opening there they must be somewhere in clintonville but i do not i do not know 

Recording: (969/ 2140) 
all right 

Recording: (970/ 2140) 
oh 

Recording: (971/ 2140) 
do not know i i would not personally like think that the parents should be held responsible i mean they do have you know a certain amount of responsibility for the fact that they should have been more aware and and especially because i mean i believe that those or at least one of the two had been in counseling and had to you know was doing it aggression management or something like that um you know you would think that if they were going through something like that you would just sort of you know maybe 

Recording: (972/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (973/ 2140) 
so that is the tourists here about it you know it is like you know 

Recording: (974/ 2140) 
um 

Recording: (975/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (976/ 2140) 
well basically it is the same thing here but some of your management is real good i have seen people that that you know are super but i have seen people that are bad the problem is you get a bad management and it can make your life hell i do not care who you are 

Recording: (977/ 2140) 
all you do is you just keep your records of of um you know what you spend on things and then there is a form you fill out and how much you have if you have taken any depreciation you know you need to basically put that back in and deduct your cost and then there is a percentage that goes on your schedule either goes in the front of your form that goes into your income and then it is just taxed it is just not it is really not that hard 

Recording: (978/ 2140) 
then 

Recording: (979/ 2140) 
um-hum yeah i am just learning the area so but i like it so far it seems really nice and uh there is a seems like there is a lot more to do in columbus obviously but 

Recording: (980/ 2140) 
why do i think that is um 

Recording: (981/ 2140) 
everyone might experiment or try or make a mistake but the way he is handling it saying i am not even gonna digify that question over and over and over if he did not do it he might as well just be like no i did not do it 

Recording: (982/ 2140) 
downtown which is where this my one of my orchestras plays a lot and uh we sang another different kinds of churches and said what we liked about and what we did not maybe it had some feed back i think the new building is acoustically very good it is certainly much better than old worship center because i do not know if you have seen a picture or anything of the church but the old worship center was designed by a modern architect 

Recording: (983/ 2140) 
um-hum at this point um i am not a uh i am not against the urban schools but if it was my own personal child i would not moved to a suburban area and taught columbus gets their act together they are and so it such bad shape right now that i do think the state will take over the columbus public school is in two years yeah they have threatened it um and if they do not pull their scores up um they will you know 

Recording: (984/ 2140) 
and move on um that is that is basically my fear but uh as one of the guys tried to help me said well listen i am afraid of that too so because right there in that pit there that is god now if you remember that there is nothing in here that can you even as hot as it gets you know and when you think about that you try not to think too much why you are in there although 

Recording: (985/ 2140) 
or they you know they come back to visit me sometimes from the high school 

Recording: (986/ 2140) 
yeah it is ridiculous i mean plus it is a nationally recognized school so a degree from ohio state i mean you could go anywhere in the nation someone is at least gonna recognize it because it is a big it is a big big name ashland would be more of a sell i would be like okay we it is small it is private it is accredited but still 

Recording: (987/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (988/ 2140) 
does not matter how much money they are giving for their education they 

Recording: (989/ 2140) 
yeah i think mostly they did uh i was kind of surprised um which class was this in i think this was in better introduction to the arts class i was kind of surprised that one of the students in my class thought it was very hard and i did not think it was that hard at all but she wrote me some kind of nasty you know at the last class or before the last class that she had a straight a average at this school before that my class and i was giving her a b and she was her 

Recording: (990/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (991/ 2140) 
uh i do not know where he got to contact but anyway he went up to bune i went and joined a national guard out uh which was field artillery and uh with the expectation of there being mobilized soon which they were and uh so he he was home one weekend and talked to me about well field artillery i was exposed to that when i was a in our o t c at ames so i thought that is be better than carrying 

Recording: (992/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (993/ 2140) 
kids out there that need love and 

Recording: (994/ 2140) 
but and when it came down to it i mean the what was the protest really about you know and i am not being clear because i am not exactly sure where i am going with this i am very cynical uh about about the world i have inherited uh because i see a world in which my political view have been silenced by fifty years of of you know like international politics uh and sort of like propaganda 

Recording: (995/ 2140) 
um i went to let us see i applied to emory harvard duke university of chicago and washington university so i got into three of those um they they were neat places but 

Recording: (996/ 2140) 
i have no idea 

Recording: (997/ 2140) 
oh yes 

Recording: (998/ 2140) 
yeah he was up there too the old guy with beard and a twee jacket you know it is pretty cool and uh they said most you know most of students are not even from delaware 

Recording: (999/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (1000/ 2140) 
right right that is the amazing thing about this country is that there is enough space in the united states and north america that you can have all these and redible monstrosity developments and still be able to find relatively wild places between them yeah 

Recording: (1001/ 2140) 
something to think about 

Recording: (1002/ 2140) 
yeah they are going it is spring break a couple of teachers are taking a bunch of kids 

Recording: (1003/ 2140) 
you know they should not know where the keys are if there were keys to the gun cabinet or whatever i mean the fact that you know how do you explain your way out of your kids taking guns to school 

Recording: (1004/ 2140) 
i 

Recording: (1005/ 2140) 
they uh what they 

Recording: (1006/ 2140) 
he is an educator which is all the more reason to go to school because he sees it and he is like yeah they 

Recording: (1007/ 2140) 
that it is going well i might make national news i just 

Recording: (1008/ 2140) 
that is my dad has red hair and blue eyes so 

Recording: (1009/ 2140) 
okay so um who chris and i uh spent the rest of the evening calling people i i got it in my head that i did not want anybody to call and say how is your dad doing and so the best way to do with that situation was to call globally across the board plus it was a fun psychological experiment just as as they go because how often do you get to tell people to kill themselves this morning so i i like hi how you doing hey no i have talked to 

Recording: (1010/ 2140) 
well um see he moved into an apartment over on eleventh avenue 

Recording: (1011/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1012/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1013/ 2140) 
um-hum um-hum 

Recording: (1014/ 2140) 
ground up but so my mom was working in a it is gonna sound sickening i was twelve years old i would even have to come home for school and stick supplies up on

yeah i just think you can not you can not call for across the board raises there definitely some people there who deserve a lot more money than what they are getting 

Recording: (1088/ 2140)

Recording: (1107/ 2140) 
i mean i think they could try if their either kids try and push them away they should not you know let their kids push them away you know it gets you make your kid go out with you and do things 

Recording: (1108/ 2140) 
too much of a role model figure anymore um i mean obviously it should be someones they respect but i can not say that they would be like oh he does it so i am gonna have to do it too or whatever 

Recording: (1109/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1110/ 2140)

Recording: (1122/ 2140) 
right yeah yeah that is very true 

Recording: (1123/ 2140) 
they it was it was all very progressive you could tell you could really tell that they had an opinion about this um we talked about positives and negatives of our things about um like the new system some of the stuff i already knew 

Recording: (1124/ 2140) 
really do not think we are incredibly racist

Recording: (1130/ 2140) 
kind of you know we know but it is 

Recording: (1131/ 2140) 
you know what my parents never did because um they knew i was always level headed i always had a lot of boyfriends you know but i always i always felt like i was waiting for the right one 

Recording: (1132/ 2140) 
and some of them did and some of them were just complete idiots but you find that anywhere 

Recording: (1133/ 2140) 
we needed that 

Recording: (1134/ 2140) 
um-hum but that is kind of it it you know it kind of came through where they were like uh when i was growing up we had the uh uh you know you had your jocks and everything of course and you had your uh we were called dads you know um and i was kind of like in the middle you know i i played a little bit of you know but i also associated with him and they were basically potheads you know and everything so uh so like i say i have you know i was kind of a associate 

Recording: (1135/ 2140) 
did not no my husband yeah he is he is from she can wear a bandana but that is it and i you know i would love to do that with her only on things like that i would not be the type that would put a spitter on her on tuesday and a little skirt on her on wednesday but i i would get a kick out of that um she uh

you know it is like look you always think i could you know look i am doing really well look how wonderful everything is 

Recording: (1142/ 2140) 
i think sometimes you there is a trade off between time and money and you just have to look at it and say which is really more important 

Recording: (1143/ 2140) 
that is probably what i will do ignore to until like august or july and then start paying attention 

Recording: (1144/ 2140)

yes 

Recording: (1153/ 2140) 
they saw us have difficult times and they saw us saw us our spouses crying together forgiving one another arguing one another just as much as you could have being human relation they saw that they saw the love for one another they saw overnight where i would start care carrying for my dad because my mother died instantly and he will like short term an hour and now he has true i did not know whether i see all their lives and i have learned all that and 

Recording: (1154/ 2140)

Recording: (1162/ 2140) 
no asking each other opinions or anything like

Recording: (1232/ 2140) 
to get bags of apples and chicken sandwiches and apple juice but but then here comes the uh cooper is wife and his daughter and like his and i am thinking they are putting all these his family up in this hotel the night before a game i mean i do not know i just thought it was very strange that he would have his whole family staying there with him with uh none of those boys get to bring anybody you know i mean 

Recording: (1233/ 2140) 
there is a huge one tunnel yeah 

Recording: (1234/ 2140) 
general uh opposition to this kind of thing uh no matter where it is anymore uh my being seventy six years of age has a major you are bearing because i see the the total destruction of our center cities uh and i see when i speak of center cities i do not necessarily mean just city size of columbus was which is the largest one in the state of ohio now but i am talking places like washington court house with maybe have fifteen thousand or 

Recording: (1235/ 2140)

Recording: (1246/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1247/ 2140) 
yeah and i do not know if it is quite that bad but it was certainly some things that he is been doing that are are not proved up and i am not real up on that so 

Recording: (1248/ 2140) 
i am living over on iuka uh if you on the other side of high street you know the mcdonald is right by high street it is like 

Recording: (1249/ 2140) 
i think that is too young to talk about birth control methods and everything but you know with aids and that as ramped as is now and there is so many more women that have it um start off it was mostly men um women have got to know as uh at an early age you know about these different diseases and things 

Recording: (1250/ 2140) 
right it is bad it is bad on the other hand it is not good to let your mind wander off somewhere i i find myself having to focus sometimes do not there really um-hum 

Recording: (1251/ 2140) 
like management here 

Recording: (1252/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1253/ 2140)

Recording: (1256/ 2140) 
was in seventy eight uh and then i have just i have stayed there and it is grown a lot in the work chain changes it is an interesting place to work because uh but first the job is almost a different job every year because so many changes are happening we are trying to stay out in front of what in front of what library innovations and front of web and that innovations and try and incorporate it also it is it ya know it is 

Recording: (1257/ 2140) 
but um um one time i i read somewhere that a a mexican lady who came across the border to have her baby and they put the little band on and they wrote female and then they wrote her last name she said to her husband when he came over to see her well they have already named her look femalee 

Recording: (1258/ 2140) 
and he always said well i am so allergic but then he did not have any problems um-hum 

Recording: (1259/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1260/ 2140) 
yeah i hear 

Recording: (1261/ 2140) 
but um 

Recording: (1262/ 2140) 
well how he felt in knowing that we were not neglecting him on two different things we have always emphasized that knowing what is right knowing that what is just is one thing it is dealing with the emotions is another one 

Recording: (1263/ 2140) 
but he just did not have a very high opinion of the army 

Recording: (1264/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (1265/ 2140) 
yeah well he thinks he can do it 

Recording: (1266/ 2140) 
wow 

Recording: (1267/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1268/ 2140)

Recording: (1269/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1270/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1271/ 2140)

like uh right now their biggest campaign is uh the some elementary school i believe no i think it is a high school in maryon was built on um an old weapons depote and so like leukemia is risen and so like that is what their main campaign now is to inform the public and try and uh get that changed they have also done other things uh other they do anything dealing with the environment uh like exposure uh things like that so 

Recording: (1276/ 2140) 
it i i do not know how to tell you that um i mean it it 

Recording: (1277/ 2140) 
fact that that is only thing i felt difficult about about living there was they would be asking all these incredible questions and i would be trying to do the dishes or something monday like that it is like i do not wanna do the dishes i just wanna answer the question 

Recording: (1278/ 2140) 
you know conscientious that there are

Recording: (1284/ 2140) 
feel you can not put a value on human life um you know there were just subtle things that you know my sense of taste and smell was gone for about a year and a half uh just all the trauma that goes involved with it not just not just the physical trauma i mean that was enough to kill anybody but because of me because of my size because of my strength uh i was not killed yeah um-hum 

Recording: (1285/ 2140) 
um-hum

Recording: (1316/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1317/ 2140) 
and uh so they went up there but the germans caught on pretty quick and they made it pretty hot and that area of anzio was just flat as this stable almost for an area back from the um mediterranean back probably ten miles i was ten or twelve miles long the coast alone and uh so we we had enough area to manipulate 

Recording: (1318/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1319/ 2140) 
you know imagine it and that is basically what happened to her and her mom had three kids by three different dads and they thought if they could get her out of that environment they actually have or move in with them they were her temporary foster parents and she just turned sixteen so she was fifteen when she moved in with them she to change and i do not know what could have changed it if they would have got her out earlier but basically all three of them

Recording: (1332/ 2140) 
i have no problem with a man being with a man or woman being with a woman but uh if if that was the relationship for everybody

Recording: (1338/ 2140) 
yeah yeah i i do not know but it then then they second guess the mother and she risks her life and all they they can not do that i mean you know it is too bad that you know she was not there to to go on with what they were planning on doing but is not that all right to to take other countries kids even i mean that is another thing i mean to america we will take everyone and every you know but then we have all these this crime because we have all these terrorist people that come from i mean that is all they have grown up with is 

Recording: (1339/ 2140) 
in high school yeah i was friends with most of them 

Recording: (1340/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1341/ 2140) 
did you get it taped everything i do not care if it is over time or not as long 

Recording: (1342/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1343/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1344/ 2140) 
middle 

Recording: (1345/ 2140) 
um at the same time in at the same time um that my mother and my dad split up i was just about to start my second year at worthington high school so i am about to start my sophomore year and for the first time in something like three years i am at the school for two years in a row and so i was like no i i just finally made friends there is no way in hell i am leaving the friend i just finally succeeded in making um my my father 

Recording: (1346/ 2140) 
i 

Recording: (1347/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1348/ 2140) 
um-hum right 

Recording: (1349/ 2140) 
you have spelled every name you have read every name you have written every name practically there are not any that you have not heard of 

Recording: (1350/ 2140) 
walk us all the way through the hospital 

Recording: (1351/ 2140) 
just just kind of instinct i guess um yeah actually there are quite a there is a a a well pretty well known doctor that has a ton of books and i go to la leche league and that is kind of their philosophy in a way yeah just that breast feeding is you know away to mother and 

Recording: (1352/ 2140) 
well 

Recording: (1353/ 2140) 
yeah it is kind of fun 

Recording: (1354/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1355/ 2140) 
would not have been smiling from down there that up here when he dropped me off he did not even know 

Recording: (1356/ 2140) 
wames freshman year and every single one of them was accurate it was really really really really funny we all lose something expensive by the end of the year and had my bikes do not let william will william will he and the big one that i was gonna mention was william will either grow in his faith significantly or will go exact opposite direction and i knew one or i knew what happened because i am the i mean my roommate my freshman year for the first quarter was a drug dealer oh 

Recording: (1357/ 2140) 
well i agree that we should help them maybe through some sort of government program but i think what really hurts them the most is the people that actually give them the money on high street because it really does not motivate them to get out of the gutter i mean if they can make a living off of begging change off of college students they are probably gonna stay because it is really easy life 

Recording: (1358/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1359/ 2140) 
not on airplanes but on heating cooling systems 

Recording: (1360/ 2140) 
it is a lot of the it looks uh looking feels a lot a lot the same 

Recording: (1361/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1362/ 2140) 
and then how satisfying is that to them when you have chance talk to them that is what we need to learn more from interview have more meaningful interviews of these people so we can learn from them i put them on spotlight but we some of all we do not still wanna uh i guess flood them with the we do not want get negative answer because all might hurt the image of the university oh gee you know i mean who was it cats and lawyers oh yeah 

Recording: (1363/ 2140) 
and uh they are very into capitalism and their lives are working pretty good for them so

Recording: (1365/ 2140) 
anything else is a hardware failure and you would have to go fix it somewhere else anyway so if you know how to put operating system on your machine you can start over if you can start over there is no reason to be scared of anything that you do probably number one in playing with computers for most people is being afraid that they are going to break something 

Recording: (1366/ 2140) 
i dont know its rude um um trying to come up with like uh uh narrative that is both fun and brief okay so um my friend chris and i are upstairs playing on the computer and um my sister is downstairs watching television it sunday morning and um i am trying to figure out how this game works trying to figure how this game works and then i said i i have got some information on this game out in the car i gotta go get it

exactly huge 

Recording: (1372/ 2140) 
hum 

Recording: (1373/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1374/ 2140)

Recording: (1376/ 2140) 
and we would adjust the guns call down shifts so they could come within reasonable close to that 

Recording: (1377/ 2140) 
and uh ten cent store theater i forget a couple other shops and um when orrin was about i do not know it was five five or maybe six or seven years old he had been explicitly told that he was not to go up there i do not know a quarter 

Recording: (1378/ 2140) 
so 

Recording: (1379/ 2140) 
uh well the problem is is uh like say every airline wants to go to new york city and they want all their businessman there at eight a m well an airport has so many runways and so many taxiways and you know like say ten airplanes every ten minutes can come in and out of those airports well uh they end up shooting like thirty there so instead of letting them all get in the air and stand up there and hold while they are you know shooting them in what they do is they 

Recording: (1380/ 2140) 
um all of them the university is divided up in different areas and there is a shop within each area that takes care of all the maintenance needs for those areas usually they are about twenty buildings or so ours is in the northeast area from wexner down through the oval to on and about uh uh derby or so around in there and then on over to woodsworth 

Recording: (1381/ 2140) 
oh yeah there is always people out there 

Recording: (1382/ 2140) 
um i i took a class for war processing war processing one too i took those and um tell you truth i can not remember if they taught me how to balance a check book out 

Recording: (1383/ 2140) 
yeah i i thought in the beginning i missed mirror lake cafe so bad so had the good subs and all that i do not i do not know why i missed them i do not i go back and now i just do not like it anymore 

Recording: (1384/ 2140) 
um it is pretty dangerous drug i would say for the most part um not so much the getting high part of it but just what goes into it 

Recording: (1385/ 2140) 
hum 

Recording: (1386/ 2140) 
this 

Recording: (1387/ 2140) 
there is very definitely 

Recording: (1388/ 2140) 
you know with the computer and everything um he is uh he is a really good handy man he can do anything so he is really helping me he he is really into design and stuff so he likes to paint and um you know he is really open he is learned a lot about gardening for me and you know that is one of my main things is gardening and hum 

Recording: (1389/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1390/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1391/ 2140) 
um-hum um-hum 

Recording: (1392/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1393/ 2140) 
yeah exactly so you know once you once you get to a certain degree of uh frustration you need to relieve that somehow so that is pretty much why we moved 

Recording: (1394/ 2140) 
really 

Recording: (1395/ 2140) 
from our friends that have gone yeah with the their discipline is exploring child from school well they are exploring them to a home where the parents were where they are just getting three days a free play i mean pretty much to get in trouble and cause more trouble they really are learning from that 

Recording: (1396/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (1397/ 2140) 
well yeah i think it is real important to really get a get a good uh feel for how you are and all your beliefs and all that they have to really match and uh and if they do not um then it is not ever gonna work because there is always gonna be conflict and friction and all that kind of thing so i think it is real important and there is no age limit on that to when you really feel good about yourself and you really know what you wanna do then that is the only time that you can really commit and say yeah we 

Recording: (1398/ 2140) 
yeah i think basically normal hours would be like eight to twelve and then you go home during lunchtime because that is the big meal a day you go home and eat with your family that is really important 

Recording: (1399/ 2140) 
sunday 

Recording: (1400/ 2140) 
i have not i know when did they have so many beaches i mean i know they had a good reputation you know for for like just just just you know just having a great vacation time because nobody always came back from washington and said oh you yeah place was terrible you know weather was bad you know that that people were people were rude everybody is are there it is they said oh you gotta go i gotta go you guys said you know it is a long flight but it is well with the time i am 

Recording: (1401/ 2140) 
uh i think they lost think ohio state lost because it was just out there raining and breathing and after a while got out of hand and i 

Recording: (1402/ 2140) 
well that is probably the roof right there so 

Recording: (1403/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1404/ 2140) 
she is very bright she is very she comes from an extremely dysfunctional family her uh parent is divorced and she is about four her mother is not go all like her father said that he would take her with him and then after he got divorced he changed his mind so she is pretty much raised herself and it is a big it it is terrible things but she is had to go through and and she is made it very clear that she will not live with an alcoholic and that is helped straighten him out so and our feeling was never that the alcoholism or 

Recording: (1405/ 2140) 
so i think 

Recording: (1406/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (1407/ 2140) 
i think that basically that is at an enough show they have reached a point in their life where you know the their cowards as far as going out and killing themselves but they want to kill themselves slowly by drink themselves a death or um smoking you know whatever you know smoking uh for crack or whatever and uh and they just living in a hell i mean 

Recording: (1408/ 2140) 
um early admission pathway um-hum 

Recording: (1409/ 2140) 
no 

Recording: (1410/ 2140) 
do not need to work that many hours when thats 

Recording: (1411/ 2140) 
and you did not have the violence and stuff like that i have never heard and you know i am just using pot right now 

Recording: (1412/ 2140) 
much more widely used once you get into college um but i mean as far as like the pot and just things like that i mean i can not say i see any difference between 

Recording: (1413/ 2140) 
um-hum it does 

Recording: (1414/ 2140) 
um probably for the most part i mean as long as they have a political background of some sort i can not say i see any real difference i mean for the most part they have to be able to do anything else any guy can do so 

Recording: (1415/ 2140) 
oh it was really rough um-hum jamaica really there is a lot of other people that is involved with me though why is 

Recording: (1416/ 2140) 
harley at all which i you know it is actually my family is business so um i started working there to help them out but you know as i am been working there for a while i have went to move up you know so 

Recording: (1417/ 2140) 
the herbs the herbs 

Recording: (1418/ 2140) 
i do not think we take up huge amount and then uh we get some of the service through orinet as well which is i think it is just up lane avenue they give us the dormee name and all that 

Recording: (1419/ 2140) 
um sort of they would make their own decision when they got older what they wanted to do or they wanted to go with it 

Recording: (1420/ 2140) 
you know 

Recording: (1421/ 2140) 
but he is also like i said he is got five kids they live in low income housing they are collecting welfare 

Recording: (1422/ 2140) 
when i threatened to take him to court and it took almost two months after that 

Recording: (1423/ 2140) 
because now they are getting to these where they are fighting more and you know and you got a boy and a girl and you know it is 

Recording: (1424/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1425/ 2140) 
but then uh it is like it some evil person back there in the screening room puts some of this junk in there right in the middle and then you go you can not stop and not watch that you no you can not and if i was in charge of it i cut some of it out it is not that important 

Recording: (1426/ 2140) 
was not so much of a hate thing it was just more these are the people i like to hang out with if you do not like them that is fine 

Recording: (1427/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1428/ 2140) 
and i think that you know i think that just because you know you do so it because i know how i have done studies and i think some of those classes and you just think about it that way and i think a lot of these people just you know they say the nurse has something you take everything for effect and i thought that was kind of strange but i mean i think there is a lot of things that are probably positive enough about it that i would want to do it for for a as long as i could 

Recording: (1429/ 2140) 
thirty nine 

Recording: (1430/ 2140) 
i that this will never work i am not interested pay you back and he said no no no just let us just work with us just work with us we will we will take care of this so i end up selling to him for a hundred and forty four but it was just funny because i thought i thought i they are never gonna get to where i have to be and we are not even gonna play this game back and forth 

Recording: (1431/ 2140) 
around more than somebody else 

Recording: (1432/ 2140)

yeah it is a lot smaller than columbus though 

Recording: (1458/ 2140) 
his speed was like say seventy mile an hour before and now it is gonna be twenty because he does not know how to do it and that is the problem they are running into they have all these qualified people who know how to separate airplanes how to get them in trail and you know everything but now they have got to do this extra part which is going to make their job easier down the road but everybody hates change so what they are doing now is it they are having problems because people can not take the volume of airplanes because they are trying to keep up with the computer so it is making it even slower 

Recording: (1459/ 2140) 
medication of his own free will that was his responsibility to take that medicine every day just like it is mine take mine every day and when i stopped taking mine that was my responsibility which is why i do not wanna go to the legal system to try and make an excuse even though there is uh there is uh some law that protect people that if they were drunk or on the influence of medication or or off the influence of medication um in case

well they pretty much put by the test scores they do not sit you down like in private schools they do this they sit you down one to one just like we are they spend probably you know maybe twenty thirty minutes a day actually getting to know the student what the student still needs for the completion grade and once they figure that you are able to go there then up you go right up the ladder 

Recording: (1468/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1469/ 2140)

Recording: (1485/ 2140) 
she goes well you had to it would cost money i said uh lord 

Recording: (1486/ 2140) 
yeah that is i mean that is really a tough one uh because it is i think people are looking for easy answers and there is no easy answer uh and do not think it is violence on tv i do not think it is working parents i think it is i do not i do not know what it is it seems to be something more pervasive than could be saw deesley uh i i i do not know it is a tough but then i do not know you yeah i mean your daughter it uses daughters you know it is

Recording: (1491/ 2140) 
you get into catch twenty two because of the legislation name and you can not require i do not see how you can require a uh a guy who buys a gun to buy a a lock and then buy a safe for the for the gun and and and do all that stuff because that in case of a murder comes into your house which is why why you have a gun anyway you have something like that happening otherwise you should not have one unless you are a sportsman and uh then you know you are it is not gonna be worth it to have 

Recording: (1492/ 2140) 
like yeah like like five hundred people on lecture hall yeah

Recording: (1498/ 2140) 
yeah i think i am i am perfectly good done

Recording: (1500/ 2140) 
i she is always trying to recruit people to come and visit but it is like a two hour drive and then yeah everybody is busy you know that is four hours of driving and um do not know it is just too hard to keep everybody in touch that way but 

Recording: (1501/ 2140) 
town with the tunnel 

Recording: (1502/ 2140) 
well clown cone is not there anymore clown cone yeah you could get like a bag of um tuddy rolls and pay only five cents so um that is gone no that was a kid thing um my grandfather used to own inimen market 

Recording: (1503/ 2140) 
he thought it was great that i was going to school but 

Recording: (1504/ 2140) 
yeah but you learned to know her name 

Recording: (1505/ 2140) 
you know 

Recording: (1506/ 2140) 
oh 

Recording: (1507/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1508/ 2140) 
uh it i mean it is a lot better than it was even a year ago 

Recording: (1509/ 2140) 
well no actually my mom did not she was a very bad kid 

Recording: (1510/ 2140) 
yeah it was a homemade bell and arrow 

Recording: (1511/ 2140) 
the majority of the ones that do not get the guidance at home that you are trying to rethink on good uh boy scouts 

Recording: (1512/ 2140) 
right yeah 

Recording: (1513/ 2140) 
try if he had children and if you are here in the this country and he had children why you have he children to start with 

Recording: (1514/ 2140) 
yeah and and the problem is uh the problem is seeing things in other people i mean actually seeing spirits in other people in terms of someone said the eyes are the mirror to the soul that is very true you know i can see certain people is eyes when i was in the hospital the confusion the unsure feelings 

Recording: (1515/ 2140) 
does not that get back more or less to the thing about everybody being me me me now and therefore they really do not so much care about where they came from and what they are and who they are 

Recording: (1516/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1517/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1518/ 2140) 
really 

Recording: (1519/ 2140) 
it is a yes it is it is a catholic school environment so it will be interesting to see what evolves from the children is uh attention to the the romantic side of religion as compared to the baptist so 

Recording: (1520/ 2140) 
right and then they wonder what you know i do not know what is happened it is the other person who is changed you know and if you if you start changing your behavior you usually get the kinds of changes i always figure if you treat people the way that will go on real thing if you if you give out what you want back you get it 

Recording: (1521/ 2140) 
or like i talked to this one guy he was he was a navy seal and he did like a a couple tours in vietnam and he was he was talking about how he was he was drunk and he was he was from alab he was like yeah i am about half drunk now so i am trying to figure out where his model number is and like i do not know i talked to him for like fifteen minutes 

Recording: (1522/ 2140) 
think that is great you know i think obviously there is always a downside and but i think that too many people abuse the system and you know unfortunately it is very hard when you know then it ruins it for the people who really do need it and but you know as long as they 

Recording: (1523/ 2140) 
like it is okay i mean it is like a country school which was always real rude too i was always like me and like my friends were always like though because i used to have real long hair and so that was like i used to be like a big hippy year like um that was i guess weird kind of like being odd people in it in a small like in a small mid western farming school it was kind of odd i guess um i do not know um 

Recording: (1524/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1525/ 2140) 
as much as you could you know we are poor but we managed 

Recording: (1526/ 2140) 
now people like that can not work when i was a kid your family took care of you there was not the welfare and stuff like this but you do not have a family structure no more 

Recording: (1527/ 2140) 
when you just think that our major resource is is our children and our offspring then we better not you know 

Recording: (1528/ 2140) 
since an hour at the beverly across the street on the avenue so um uh but but anyhow you know they could never understand you know you did not you never got a job with it you know what why would you go to school and waste all that money i was the best money i ever spent 

Recording: (1529/ 2140) 
yeah we was going up there to can not really remember you know it is been twenty years ago and i just you know i do not have any real recollection 

Recording: (1530/ 2140) 
nope humum 

Recording: (1531/ 2140) 
and if i was in the same situation i would be doing the same things so 

Recording: (1532/ 2140) 
wow you yeah i know 

Recording: (1533/ 2140) 
appeals appeals 

Recording: (1534/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1535/ 2140) 
whole time i was in high school and college and all this kind of thing but it was just like you know people just thought oh you are american you are here therefore you must have lots of extra money to throw around and you know they just sort of do not grasp the fact that you know you can have made sacrifices to be there but i do think also in films you know i remember actually being in bristol and that film california with brad pitt and julie louis and you know they are in the trailer and everything else 

Recording: (1536/ 2140) 
we now run over to gregorian and uh that sort of thing but back to your question i think you were asking our 

Recording: (1537/ 2140) 
yeah i am actually like a month older than him 

Recording: (1538/ 2140) 
but he would bring in nutritionalist or whatever to explain to the parents blah blah blah 

Recording: (1539/ 2140) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (1540/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1541/ 2140) 
yes you are you are saying you do not need to have a leader in the family you and if i am gonna be a leader i am gonna be the one i am gonna be the one not the sperm bank oh you came from this little tub here oh okay that well that is the principal effect no i have to be because there is no father here well 

Recording: (1542/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1543/ 2140) 
uh technical systems and policy end of it and hated it the other years were fine but those last three worked pretty bad uh 

Recording: (1544/ 2140) 
oh my gosh it is one of they are like you know falling out of trees you know 

Recording: (1545/ 2140) 
um i talk to him every now and then 

Recording: (1546/ 2140) 
so i mean carrying cabinets and he will do it as long as you are paying him he will do it 

Recording: (1547/ 2140) 
i am i am not built that way 

Recording: (1548/ 2140) 
well i do think access is too easy but it is sort of like anything else i think if laws were passed the people who were against it would be so you know just themselves that it would i do not know for how long but i think it would make the situation not with the shootings and things like that but i think would make the just the gun situation probably much worse for a while because people would be you know doing illegal things to get guns and that 

Recording: (1549/ 2140) 
just do that and to make sure you are relaxed enough 

Recording: (1550/ 2140) 
but i do not see it as negatively affecting me i still get all this stuff done i need to get done 

Recording: (1551/ 2140) 
doing the eleventh and doing the twelfth you can take them as many times as you need to take them but if you do not pass them all by the time you graduate you get this nifty little thing called an attendance certificate it it is not a real diploma it is like okay i attended i did not learn anything but i was there 

Recording: (1552/ 2140) 
yeah um i took one o four during winter quarter 

Recording: (1553/ 2140) 
was really great i mean it is just nice laid back country setting and you do not have to worry about that much crime well your horse might get taken in night but i do not have any horses 

Recording: (1554/ 2140) 
better so i love it 

Recording: (1555/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1556/ 2140) 
well he has two main uh main characters in his cartoon is for william joe 

Recording: (1557/ 2140) 
no huh 

Recording: (1558/ 2140) 
sure 

Recording: (1559/ 2140) 
but it it is teaching him discipline responsibility you can not do these things at this time you know i 

Recording: (1560/ 2140) 
no it was predomin it was more black than white tell you truth or might have been even but now it is more black than white definitely now because i i i live in a neighborhood where it is it is mostly black then white and that is where i have always lived my whole life 

Recording: (1561/ 2140) 
b is and um with she had kind of a hard time in high school she was uh raped by a teacher in ninth grade when she first went into a school and from there it is just been a nightmare of what how that it is affected her you know anything she goes through you blame it on that or you go back could have oh i wonder you know if she was like that because of this and you know so that is been a real struggle in high school i was i never really 

Recording: (1562/ 2140) 
i mean if i would have chosen to do that well that is my choice um you and your husband it is like what do you think you should teach them maybe not sex specifically but just like general rules for good living if your church is saying one thing but realistically you think maybe something a little bit different but what do you how do you think you can get this all that conflict okay whoa 

Recording: (1563/ 2140) 
and pete you know people do not have big families like they used to you know so 

Recording: (1564/ 2140) 
uh three years something like that hard to remember it was a long time ago 

Recording: (1565/ 2140) 
i 

Recording: (1566/ 2140) 
yeah yeah yeah 

Recording: (1567/ 2140) 
never heard a thing about it all the time i was in the service 

Recording: (1568/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1569/ 2140) 
i it is not a presidential issue kind of an issue as far as i am concerned but uh i am 

Recording: (1570/ 2140) 
so it is probably was not unexpected we just were not prepared for it i do not think you could be prepared for it 

Recording: (1571/ 2140) 
so but i had some really tough challenging jobs and yeah if i knew now what i knew then i probably could be a millionaire with all the law suits of different yeah experience with um sexual harassment 

Recording: (1572/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1573/ 2140) 
and they were in italy and europe and uh there was not the definite enemy vietnam that there was in europe i think that is part of it and of course they added to demush the guys that went to vietnam was a little bit different from probably as a consequence of our understanding of the the uh 

Recording: (1574/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1575/ 2140) 
yeah i um well and that was really um struggle you know i struggle for money and everything so i would take whatever would come along and when you work insecure jobs like that i mean you i had a different job every year i mean a year would come up and i would say oh okay here we go you know they are either gonna downsize or they are gonna do something and they always so i was never really shocked and i did not panic or anything and i was never without a job i never had to i never missed um you know i would say 

Recording: (1576/ 2140) 
we took um or i took uh military ethics as a philosophy course and that was really interesting because even though in even in that hierarchy there is still certain contacts within the context of war for instance if if we both know if we knowingly go into it as combatants and we are fighting for whatever it caused but if both are willingly going into it 

Recording: (1577/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1578/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1579/ 2140) 
money behind them they have lawyers behind them so they can sue for an appeal 

Recording: (1580/ 2140) 
when they drove by i 

Recording: (1581/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1582/ 2140) 
see 

Recording: (1583/ 2140) 
i went back and did a one year um schooling to get my nursing license i became an l p n so i do not have a degree my husband has a degree i put him through school i finished finished his private school 

Recording: (1584/ 2140) 
and that is what i am saying atone in for sins it is quite a hypocr when you get a church telling you that you need to ask for forgiveness when what they i mean in the church in zanesville where i went and married my grandparents and went through all my life over the door the church has a picture of christopher columbus with a missionary a priest and all his men with his sword drawn a dead native american and his feet and three more at the side looking on and fair now 

Recording: (1585/ 2140) 
got a pool if you got a pool table over down the hall i will show you it is kind of 

Recording: (1586/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1587/ 2140) 
kind of exciting because you are getting in on things that are really new and trying to master the project i am working on now um it is try to find a way to to create data that describes web resources so the libraries can take this data and put it in their catalog and integrated with the regular collection and and we are doing a lot of with that yeah it is it is pretty it is pretty neat project a lot of new things the uh java and the web give us opportunities do things that 

Recording: (1588/ 2140) 
decided to pursue the matter to the extent of marriage so that is where they met no huh uh i i would come down here two or three times like you know just trips through going to the airport and other miscellaneous things but um when i moved to the city i mean it was a real big change because i have you know used to living in the country and i moved in to smack dad in the middle of a downtown area 

Recording: (1589/ 2140) 
really it is cute 

Recording: (1590/ 2140) 
ah 

Recording: (1591/ 2140) 
see i do not shut up so i would talk to them the whole time and so they would always be really verbal and so it would seem like they had a much better understanding and could do things better than they really could like when my daughter was about five we got a hamster and i said well you know you make sure you give it food and water and when it died it and i was so surprised that she had not given been giving it food and water because she did it occasionally but to a five year old you do not yeah they do not get that stuff together or when she was eleven we sold her 

Recording: (1592/ 2140) 
oh that is okay 

Recording: (1593/ 2140) 
motherly instinct towards you know and they are all like oh aaron you should have one and you know and he knows i am gonna have one um i just knew at a young age i have always loved animals 

Recording: (1594/ 2140) 
uh yeah so i think she is getting a better education than he did not but and it is because she is doing the work and she knows she is expecting to it that is due and he my son is the kind he would rather play than work and so he he rode a lot and 

Recording: (1595/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1596/ 2140) 
it is just a different time now uh i mean i remember uh one of the things i saw when i was a kid on a news cast you know with uh uh the vietnamese guy uh have a vietnam guy getting spring is blood out on national tv you know and uh uh that did not make me go out do that you know so yeah he made me want not want to do it you know because my brother was in was in vietnam he was in the army 

Recording: (1597/ 2140) 
much in school with that 

Recording: (1598/ 2140) 
it is right on their main street and they have gorgeous really neat unique things 

Recording: (1599/ 2140) 
that is it oh 

Recording: (1600/ 2140) 
six normal kids because l d kids would be creative and they would think of ways to get out of there and the normal kids would sit and cry 

Recording: (1601/ 2140) 
so i ended up doing that for about three months and ended up flunking out of uh o u in the in the first three months of the first quarter so uh then i got my notice in january so 

Recording: (1602/ 2140) 
you do not slide as much 

Recording: (1603/ 2140) 
she was a cowboy and he was an indian 

Recording: (1604/ 2140) 
now that does not make any extra work for the teacher but it gives him a shot he usually will not answer the concepts he will usually answer the stuff that he knows and if you only grade him on that he might have a shot at a c or a b i mean there is all kind of ways to modify uh give a reduced work amount uh give a kid a copy of another student is notes of his or crummy and he can not study from him we even have a thing in our school that it is 

Recording: (1605/ 2140) 
that is true oh 

Recording: (1606/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1607/ 2140) 
for example so you should name her tamara 

Recording: (1608/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (1609/ 2140) 
i do not know what it is like to grow up in anywhere else i i know what it is like uh kind of like where my cousin lived in new york because i would go there in the summer summers but uh hum did i like growing up in columbus uh how do you judge that you know what do you compare that to 

Recording: (1610/ 2140) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (1611/ 2140) 
really they are they are the biggest assholes 

Recording: (1612/ 2140) 
uh think when i was five because i was like yeah yeah i do not really remember them being really together 

Recording: (1613/ 2140) 
word 

Recording: (1614/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1615/ 2140) 
oh i tighten this good was like it is falling to i oh there i can go cool perfect 

Recording: (1616/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1617/ 2140) 
well also do one is the last time you seen a baseball game kids play a baseball game in the neighborhood 

Recording: (1618/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1619/ 2140) 
oh they were helping out the the new guys 

Recording: (1620/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1621/ 2140) 
yeah i guess they do i do not know what where where it is or how many they have 

Recording: (1622/ 2140) 
yeah they are gonna most likely raise it up to twenty one since all these uh the kentucky and marolina and color all those school shootings and can not believe man i mean there is articles in there you would not even believe if you have not read them 

Recording: (1623/ 2140) 
that is where you need to you can not just say hey we got to snook out here we can screw him that is the problem and you are saying does it does it does it take home does it take church it takes morals and that is why i was telling me before we got away from morals in our society we could care less about you i always said a a good successful salesman would be able to sell his own mother i mean sell his own mother on an on the market 

Recording: (1624/ 2140) 
you know 

Recording: (1625/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1626/ 2140) 
i do not have a good opinion of uh columbus schools at all no not at all 

Recording: (1627/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1628/ 2140) 
word 

Recording: (1629/ 2140) 
of the puzzle that that helps i think mathy sheppard helped also 

Recording: (1630/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1631/ 2140) 
because the problem with guns in my opinion is you do not have to think to use it it takes you know you do not have to throw and load it and in a split second i think we all are capable of shooting somebody for whatever reason you know just stupidity or what not just in a split second you know we we might have that once in a life but we can kill somebody that quickly and you can not go oh you know 

Recording: (1632/ 2140) 
i retire uh i would like to be like the mount sterlin or something like that 

Recording: (1633/ 2140) 
should be tried and hopefully convicted on the facts and should not have anything else added into it i i think doing that is going to do the same thing that the many civil rights and the affirmative action programs and the bussing did to people as going to turn people against uh gays like that turn people against blacks for a while although ultimately i think it did make a difference i i had a have a black friend at the ohio education association was very active in the sixties 

Recording: (1634/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1635/ 2140) 
yeah probably have to go to dublin or you know worthington somewhere on there to find couple millionaires but uh 

Recording: (1636/ 2140) 
you know 

Recording: (1637/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1638/ 2140) 
it is just major things that you have to do that are a lot more time consuming 

Recording: (1639/ 2140) 
they are 

Recording: (1640/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1641/ 2140) 
figure they will be plenty of pizza my mom i just want green jello you just did not want to make me snack no 

Recording: (1642/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1643/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1644/ 2140) 
it is an island but a planet together i liked it there i kind of like i i figure they will probably hook up but i do not like how the show this show and this happened with deep space nine to and even with next generation for a little bit how the shows become soap opera like um i mean the romantic aspects of the stories do not really appeal to me very much um i am more interested in the social things and you know good old special effects um but uh huh 

Recording: (1645/ 2140) 
oh that is right 

Recording: (1646/ 2140) 
but she was never interested in never really interested in boys or in sports in high school or make up and clothes and things like that you know you are setting yourself up for ridicule in high school for that and that is what happened she would come home and tears because kids made fun of her and stuff and finally she just stopped going and within a couple months she g e d 

Recording: (1647/ 2140) 
and i do have a brother 

Recording: (1648/ 2140) 
then you would not be too familiar with everything you are 

Recording: (1649/ 2140) 
got somewhere else 

Recording: (1650/ 2140) 
nope 

Recording: (1651/ 2140) 
to you know to art whatever it is wherever it comes from and there is not that is not you know there is not the the old boy network you know not as not as much who you know to get into things uh or or that women are allowed to know the people that the boys know so it is not it is not as closed off that way 

Recording: (1652/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (1653/ 2140) 
supposedly it was my job but as you know the parents always get stuck i have a brother 

Recording: (1654/ 2140) 
fruit loops yeah and it is like what is the difference you know besides the price 

Recording: (1655/ 2140) 
really did not because i felt like i was in love with these boys yeah 

Recording: (1656/ 2140) 
oh 

Recording: (1657/ 2140) 
like ninety nine east road or something like that 

Recording: (1658/ 2140) 
most of them are still sadly just sitting there and following my directions but they are getting better 

Recording: (1659/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1660/ 2140) 
you know and when you can wrestle with him and all that right now he is just he sits there and when he cries he goes what does he want like i know go down the list hun changes type or if he had it is been three hours since he is had a bottle give him a bottle you know 

Recording: (1661/ 2140) 
yes in my opinion definitely it is the voting i know you took a little different approach in answering the question uh from over the time that that this kind of thing is eroded when based upon the word respect not ever been caught somehow or other or shown i always been the kind of person to be i never told my kids not to do something that i myself was doing examples smoking cigarettes or taking a drink of beer or taking a wine with my dinner saying go here and i do not know but i can now there are some things that the kid can not do at this age if somebody can at the mother age possibly like go out on the date for example well he is going out there forty one guy high well he is already sixteen years old enough wait sixteen years you are allowed to go to fight was by that time i will expect you be able you know know what to do uh but i mean i never did uh and my well i will not give you any examples but anyway if if i told them they could not do it i would try swearing is one of my bad habits and i know that uh i would try very very hard i got taught one time that i better watch a little more carefully by my little girl and but anyway i would always and i would apologize i if they it did not catch me doing something like i would tell them no you cannot do i would apologize see mommy was bad and mommy did that i got soap in my mouth one time because well well no no i mean not you want to hear the story funny well if you did not just see that i was making a pie i was taking this pie out of the oven there was a cherry fire and apple pie was a usually sometimes and i had not put any of them on water there either to catch it and just as i started to get out i spilled it i said a bad word you know and just as i said that word down here there is two little shoes and i was sitting there for a minute before i took it out i take it my house and i tell my mom i said well mom i said a bad word i guess that uh mommy has to have soap for her mouth because she do not want to put soap on your mouth i think yep i think you need oh 

Recording: (1662/ 2140) 
it is a traffic jam and i am not moving as i am 

Recording: (1663/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1664/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1665/ 2140) 
bru m and kim alabama 

Recording: (1666/ 2140) 
um so i am sure that probably increases the rate in public schools for them 

Recording: (1667/ 2140) 
because i guess it all came together because i do not understand how people can let their kids be hurt but 

Recording: (1668/ 2140) 
no 

Recording: (1669/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1670/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1671/ 2140) 
yeah like like sort of i mean with like m p threes and stuff i mean people do a lot of that but it is it is i do not i do not know i do not really go on the internet all that much like i do not know 

Recording: (1672/ 2140) 
oh yeah yeah we all get together we have to get a shelter house now somewhere because the nobody is house is big enough well and then we have so many little kids that it is great because uh we just go to a shelter inside and they have not you know like for christmas and things like that and they can run around the kids run around and 

Recording: (1673/ 2140) 
um-hum um-hum but i do not know if that is i think that the divorce rate has gone up because it is more socially acceptable i am sure there is plenty of people twenty years ago that would have left to have gotten a divorce had that been an option um i i think it just i think a lot of it is just depends on the way you handle it you know how you how you handle it after after the divorce is final i mean no i do you see what does that make any sense at all 

Recording: (1674/ 2140) 
um i mean obviously it is something that happens everyday and things like that um like i said by no means am i saying yeah go president clinton or anything like that but um i mean i can not say i would hold it against him for doing something like that i mean it is nothing that threatening the nation or whatever 

Recording: (1675/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1676/ 2140) 
like on a fair there regular basis even 

Recording: (1677/ 2140) 
yeah exactly which is one of the things i ran into our architecture where i mean we only had you know one or two papers we had to write 

Recording: (1678/ 2140) 
her and mother went and seen it and everything we were divorced at the time and uh then i went and bought the movie and 

Recording: (1679/ 2140) 
and my mother was always there for me i would just call my mom like hey what can i do and she just like calm down rachel just calm down and 

Recording: (1680/ 2140) 
where are you where you are asleep at 

Recording: (1681/ 2140) 
being with them 

Recording: (1682/ 2140) 
um actually i think it needs to probably start younger than that 

Recording: (1683/ 2140) 
and uh the other one is um a uh working cuff at the steubenville ohio uh 

Recording: (1684/ 2140) 
i am not sure i do not know his his dad found it and told me about it because i was not working at the time and we were trying to get it an extra income to come in and um his dad made it actually like twenty five dollars or something you know i would think he would make more than that man every time we go oh or they use up on the computer doing something so and i am on there you know just i look up baby stuff get coupons and stuff um word word 

Recording: (1685/ 2140) 
for fun we have been playing a lot of pool 

Recording: (1686/ 2140) 
i was as marathon training and i only got up to about nine miles and um i have unfortunately about fifty pounds of extra weight on me but even like i said when i was junior i have like a distance i am okay to run the lower but uh 

Recording: (1687/ 2140) 
she does know that i do not go to church 

Recording: (1688/ 2140) 
or that are having kids and i mean we talk about that is all we do is sit there and talk about our kids and what they are doing and how our parents and them react like there was this girl that just got in there today and and her parents are like flipping out because she is pregnant and um we were telling we were all telling her about oh you know um it it always starts out that way and they will ease up later on 

Recording: (1689/ 2140) 
exactly 

Recording: (1690/ 2140) 
that is okay too 

Recording: (1691/ 2140) 
you know so i do not know where to go to me the biggest thing it would be if they got rid of these saturday night special guns and stuff like that 

Recording: (1692/ 2140) 
no my roommates are i was my mom wanted me to but i i the way it stems to right now i just would rather work her money 

Recording: (1693/ 2140) 
well that is just it that is part of it because like i see my parents would not come my mother used to try to come to things at school when i would be in different things and and i really did appreciate but my father would not he just would she would say well you know he just does not like that kind of thing i mean i would be in the sunny spelling me i would be in the he he does not well two damn big your butt down there and pretend like you like it and so you know with our and my husband is the same way his family was his father died when he was nine he was like the adult 

Recording: (1694/ 2140) 
and you went ahead and did it so 

Recording: (1695/ 2140) 
you know it was well they totally embrace the culture and all the stores and everything like that and the food and you know the fast food or whatever they hate it at the same time because it is ruining you know and and and i had a lot of friends from elsewhere and you know western europe and uh yeah they just were and i i was quite surprised actually because when i first went there uh i had on an island previous i mean mackin island you know it is was just north of michigan but and i would met some english people there and it was you know there all the americans 

Recording: (1696/ 2140)

Recording: (1709/ 2140) 
because they always dress up and everything when they go to the bars so 

Recording: (1710/ 2140) 
or been around you know but um more i think doctors should more look on that avenue you know that possibly it is something else like that i have never well now with the forms you fill out with your positions and they ask you if you know about allergies and usually it is um prescriptions and things you know i mean that you have taken but they i do not know i think a lot of things have to do with food allergies anymore i really do

Recording: (1718/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1719/ 2140) 
yeah well people people do not have the priorities that they should you know what do you do you work all your life and you make a lot of money and then you die what did you do you you know did you learn anything did you teach anyone did you have an opinion about anything you know i mean that to me if you do not have time then you know you are just floating along trying to take it up space no 

Recording: (1720/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1721/ 2140) 
yeah yeah they it is gonna be hard to do in some of the other states but i do not think so 

Recording: (1722/ 2140) 
i just did not see where it would be used utilized here 

Recording: (1723/ 2140) 
uh yeah um yes and no they are kind of weird like that um one set of grandparents really i can not hear ever says anything there is a set on the other side that they are little bit more racist um but at the same time it i do not know they almost set up

Recording: (1726/ 2140) 
he is real because people give him that 

Recording: (1727/ 2140) 
i think more what they need to do is instruct or uh just make different penalties to people that carry the guns or that are shootings and things like that um because i mean for the most part i mean people really do not get too badly punished for things i mean if you look at another countries i mean like people like the asian countries places like that i mean they have really strict laws i mean if you even get caught for like 

Recording: (1728/ 2140) 
you know because then what does he have to hide and then like the fact that he did not know like i think on international policy he will be struggling if he becomes president he did not know the three leaders of the world thing and then on top of it like texas is a fairly big economy but still like to manage an entire you know an entire economy 

Recording: (1729/ 2140)

um yes and no i mean as far as the experience goes i mean i do not live on campus so do not get the entire college experience you know the whole dorms and events going place on campus it is more of things that i pick and choose that i wanna on campus i come down for um so i can not really say it is anything too drastic i mean obviously it is kind of weird when people are asking what you are doing and 

Recording: (1734/ 2140) 
tried that but yeah my my one sister that is um exactly seven years older than me were the closest and then the sister that is two years older than me she is the same way she does a lot of things that i am like why are you doing that you know they will so and she is she pretty much stays low and depressed a lot because everything she goes through but 

Recording: (1735/ 2140) 
digginee is counseling at that point 

Recording: (1736/ 2140) 
yeah yeah i guess so i mean there are people spending to spend hours on computers doing this type of thing just going out there and seeing what they can find 

Recording: (1737/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1738/ 2140) 
then they are ready to move on again you just do not get as close to people as you used to 

Recording: (1739/ 2140) 
um i mean fact of the matter is if being gay is a genetic disorder then that should have no effect on kids because they should still be i normal i guess or whatever you wanna say 

Recording: (1740/ 2140) 
uh not as much as i used to be when i was younger used to be die hard but not anymore you know um um yeah by their standards but they still were six and six you know and they probably could have won maybe couple more games but that is about it you know really 

Recording: (1741/ 2140)

hum 

Recording: (1753/ 2140) 
where they are almost segregating themselves by having these organizations because they are geared specifically towards black people and i think in a way that is almost segregating themselves from the rest of the community because they are not giving out equal opportunity to the people that need them um it is sort of like the same thing white people were doing you know forty forty years ago where that they had their white organizations or what not um and i think it is sort of going along with same lines 

Recording: (1754/ 2140) 
that would be neat that would be real neat but that is dream world so 

Recording: (1755/ 2140) 
you can not especially with kids it is just too overwhelming 

Recording: (1756/ 2140) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (1757/ 2140) 
i do not know uh maybe it i think maybe if teachers just their status in society is not real high when it should be um it is more like i have heard that like garbage men get paid more than teachers you know and how but it um so it is just like people always talk about you know education for the you know we got to like think about our child is future or whatever but really teachers are paid crap and like do not really get a lot of respect from anybody like professors and stuff 

Recording: (1758/ 2140) 
yeah if they want if they you know choose i am i am sure there is you know women that are lesbians that have been with men also you know they have been with the men and then they have been with the woman now and now they got a girlfriend so obviously you know and i feel like that was because of they got had a attraction towards women so now they think they are lesbian do not see i do not that is why i think so i do not think that but if that is their choice that is their choice so i do think they could change uh 

Recording: (1759/ 2140) 
um i would say it does not really matter either way honestly i mean fact of the matter is they are so deal with it i mean get over it i mean 

Recording: (1760/ 2140) 
um i think i think through education that is it is just gonna only help 

Recording: (1761/ 2140)

Recording: (1849/ 2140) 
okay uh i have been in columbus since nineteen seventy seven and uh i am an air traffic controller and i have three more days to work before retire i am i i am retiring sunday so and tomorrow is my retirement dinner so i am nervous about what i have to do there you know they have told me nothing except show up

Recording: (1888/ 2140) 
oh they do in ninth grade and by tenth grade in eleven they are little more focused on the fact that they better get their act together because they are gonna have to go to college and this is like the only life they are gonna get you know they kind of get that realization they start getting serious kids at middle school think everything is just a big joke you know i am gonna play in a rock band uh you know they all think they are gonna be rock stars and drummers and and you know they could care less about anything it has not hit them yet this is my real life 

Recording: (1889/ 2140) 
and columbine you know every paper had a slightly different slant on the story and you know there facts were all over the place but that is another kind of issue but um what i think caused it i mean i do not know i think that like more should have been made of the fact of you know this like terrible sort of resentment for the other students and and you know i am not 

Recording: (1890/ 2140) 
do not think it hurt me that knowing it

but it was not the worry about getting pregnant it was the worry about getting aids 

Recording: (1899/ 2140) 
yeah i mean it is like it is known but it is in a different way it is like a different type of fame than like the traditional style so it is like more of like a respect as opposed to like an adoration type thing like like it is of like a it is not like an m t v type thing you know 

Recording: (1900/ 2140) 
and you know i just really think they need to make that an uh an option for a young girl i really do because there is just you know there is just too many un wanted children there just is and that really bothers me that we do not have another option like another country um we are a lot more right wing here in america but i just feel that is got to be an option you know for these young girls it just really does 

Recording: (1901/ 2140)

Recording: (1906/ 2140) 
um freshman sophomore year yes after that i quit wrestling and i just kind of found myself being myself instead of trying to be someone else sports is definitely part of a clique you try to be part of the team and the team tries to do everything the same 

Recording: (1907/ 2140) 
and your display might be different but it is it is basic information and our and we developed the system that people started doing that on and sharing the data um actually it started here on s u campus and now we are independent 

Recording: (1908/ 2140) 
and that is essentially what the supreme court said in their last decision on this two three years ago what they said was whether we think it is right or wrong whether we think the previous supreme court was right or wrong it is been a part of this fabric of this country for more than ten years and to reverse it would create too much too many problems for people you know which i thought was a nice way of saying sorry folks but you know it is too late 

Recording: (1909/ 2140) 
that is exactly what it is 

Recording: (1910/ 2140) 
um i think i think that there should be a mandatory because you have it in big companies you have mandatory um sexual harassment tapes and and and you learn you teach the girls that it is not what they do it is how they make you feel as is constituted as your uh uh harassment there and they are too afraid and then besides that they you know there is pressures on you know you can not fault the girls for having pressures and things like that they are going through enough things as it is 

Recording: (1911/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1912/ 2140) 
we are up there it is all go go go uh 

Recording: (1913/ 2140) 
well uh the first the uh the first thing is clintonville 

Recording: (1914/ 2140) 
i would like to see that implement something like that in the united states that would be a neat thing you know because like i know like iron foundries and uh some like like the or paying jobs like they hire people that are literate and things like that and they can not like give pay checks out on thursdays because everyone will call off on fridays because they all go out and get drunk or do not know what they do with their pay checks i know that is a big big problem 

Recording: (1915/ 2140)

Recording: (1918/ 2140) 
there were things out there was nothing like what they have today you know the small little hand guns and things like that that are really easy carryable and concealable i mean like you know back in the sixties stuff like switch blades things like that i mean they had switch blades things like that yeah i mean i mean there is really nothing too different 

Recording: (1919/ 2140) 
yeah right he can not take it with you or something yeah 

Recording: (1920/ 2140) 
well no she sort of knows this is what she has to say at school and she is asking a test because she needs the points for a grade 

Recording: (1921/ 2140) 
the bad places the television things that they have on the programs they have on and i think the dads had a lot to do with changing our younger generation in the way they think the way they act what their morals are and i think that is why they are having more shootings in schools and uh the programs are terrible i think that they need to really redo them there is too much profanity there is too much sex there is too much just do what i want i gotta do my own thing that is what it when to do i want do my own thing start he says with the women is feminists movements but 

Recording: (1922/ 2140)

but the federal government and her lawyers have done that and the department of the interior still considers native americans on the same level as a dog they do not have right something wrong there and that still goes on today after about six hundred years and we got good people in this country that wanna do something about it but unfortunately you know what i am finding you you got everybody is gotta choose their path 

Recording: (1933/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1934/ 2140) 
whether they are playing a video game or they are shooting people i can not say see that as being something that affects them

Recording: (1941/ 2140) 
we try and you know we try and and teach and expand people is knowledge so that when they go out and they talk to someone about christ they do not have you know they do not blank look on their face when the person asks them something you know that somebody asks them something and they are like you know i do not know or they actually have an answer you know if and if do not know they will say i do not know but i can find out for you if you are willing to and if you are willing to give me the time to go find out well 

Recording: (1942/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1943/ 2140)

Recording: (1945/ 2140) 
al gore really does not entice me at all he claimed he invented the internet 

Recording: (1946/ 2140) 
it is about the same 

Recording: (1947/ 2140) 
um-hum and some conservative values too you know that the republicans are supposed to represent but i do not think they they are doing a very good job at that 

Recording: (1948/ 2140) 
you know they talk about drinking from the fountain now they are only gargling than not drinking much by the time they get to be fourth or fifth grade they are pretty savvy these days they are not too scared to tell you where to go and what to do

Recording: (1950/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1951/ 2140) 
oh 

Recording: (1952/ 2140) 
that was deep 

Recording: (1953/ 2140) 
i mean i think the reason that our generation is cynical a reason i am cynical is because we are handed a world in which we see and justices of the past or not the uh the the hypocr i mean because in justice it also applies in terms of things like the cold war and stuff but that is why i am center goal i hope that answers your question at least a little bit i do not know i feel kinda preachy like this is my position 

Recording: (1954/ 2140) 
word 

Recording: (1955/ 2140) 
improvement in three months and all that kind of it was image and uh we were saying the same thing you know we wanna continue this we wanna make even this better um we learn to say the negatives in a positive way and that is important you know and then you need to get that that you need to appeal to the center uh americans do not like extreme liberals they do not like extreme conservatives you know they want they want peace 

Recording: (1956/ 2140) 
you know so i think maybe not universal healthcare but for children i think it would be helpful

Recording: (1975/ 2140)

sure 

Recording: (2010/ 2140) 
oh well we who really wants to go he lived in california that is for that family i told you about was they and when he was fourteen or sixteen and he really wants to go back ac so we will probably end up there sometimes but after i finish school and after he works for a little while and i work and so that we can have enough money mean i mean we do not need to have a ton but we just should be at least a little out of that until yeah something 

Recording: (2011/ 2140) 
neither side is gonna do anything about it somebody should have did something about that because then you know they would have been do what they were supposed to do to make him you know get in the line and uh so he knew could get by with it 

Recording: (2012/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (2013/ 2140)

um-hum 

Recording: (2019/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (2020/ 2140) 
so we did it it is well he is always had some problems he is uh his problem saying focused on things unless it is something he is extremely interested in then you can not get him away from it um if it was something he it is just an example in school he would sit there and he would be rolling around on the floor and stuff while they are trying to teach something in class or else with working on a writing assignment or something they have a half hour to work on it 

Recording: (2021/ 2140) 
it took us ten years to have and i think my mom generally thought i was doing birth control and we were not but you always knew the collateral zone undertones you know is she or is not she you know it is just like well i am not gonna discuss it with her because i knew that was a no no to her but i was not but you need to know that

have nuns or anything there i mean um you know i think they were sort of more concerned with you know actually it might have been later than the first um sex education we had that young i mean it might have been more like a couple like eighth grade that they talked about condoms i doubt that they would have done that that early that i think about it but i know that there was at one point you know some sort of 

Recording: (2076/ 2140) 
right right 

Recording: (2077/ 2140) 
well i thought about that you know i mean doing something in the animal area even as a vet assistant but um with domestic animals um

Recording: (2086/ 2140) 
everybody is living longer everybody is uh there is more medical things where people get uh can be healed from things that they could not be healed from uh so everybody today is living uh basically as today as their future were back thirty years ago i mean when i was a kid you know i mean i would not really think about today i mean i was thinking tomorrow 

Recording: (2087/ 2140) 
that is a thing but the thing is some people some people say some people say well why would you do this the thing is why do not you take those people and say hey why not do what i am doing best i want to compliment the team 

Recording: (2088/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (2089/ 2140) 
um i think it is probably some of both i think it is probably more social but i mean obviously they are gonna have different views on how things work um but i mean for the most part i can not see that as being too big of a problem um obviously there are more like violent guys out there and things like that and there are women but at the same time i would not say there is anything too over 

Recording: (2090/ 2140) 
i know i am i never i never looked into that but that is a good suggestion they yeah like like being they are gonna be like yeah uh like spanish instructors no i never thought about that not till you just just uh just just that so yeah or like teaching english has a second language i know they teach those classes here so i was thinking well you know maybe i should start looking into like teaching classes but i like well i did not know that was like true or not that you can actually teach around 

Recording: (2091/ 2140) 
you know he did sneez but he knew i was not gonna get rid of the cat i had her she was my daughter

i mean my my kids went to a school that when my son had already left it but in the fourth grade they announced took all the kids in the auditorium and said we are closing next year and it was hard but you know once it is reached the point that is decision is made and announced and i mean there were good reasons for it uh and explain the reasons and you know at some point you would have to figure out how much do you want to fight something when 

Recording: (2093/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (2094/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (2095/ 2140) 
um i think i think through education that is it is just gonna only help kids because a lot times maybe the do not get that at home so they are really looking to choose the right thing to do 

Recording: (2096/ 2140) 
lot of exciting stuff going on there for libraries it is not not the old you know little lady in the butt yeah yeah uh and the web has really changed that 

Recording: (2097/ 2140) 
word 

Recording: (2098/ 2140) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (2099/ 2140) 
tv and then the movies 

Recording: (2100/ 2140) 
do not even read it much it is very conservative very republican yeah 

Recording: (2101/ 2140) 
you know and uh i was just brought up to be an honest person and um unfortunately there is a lot of people out there that you know oh they sell out their ideals and their principles for forty thousand dollars a year and then they use their family or their situation financially to sell the ideals out i am not that kind of person and i will not ever be um so if that means that i stay monetarily poor 

Recording: (2102/ 2140) 
word 

Recording: (2103/ 2140) 
exactly 

Recording: (2104/ 2140)

Recording: (2105/ 2140) 
uh he was a uh railroad clerk 

Recording: (2106/ 2140) 
um um 

Recording: (2107/ 2140) 
i always wish somebody would do a survey on that and saying at back in sixty five or whatever what is the difference between what they are teaching them then and what they teach them now is it really that matters it just our imagination just do not remember enough yeah but it seems more to me and computers really have helped it 

Recording: (2108/ 2140) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2109/ 2140) 
yeah it it might i mean good teachers do that i i still get upset when i was teaching school i did activity based teaching um yeah i was doing some volunteer work at dublin schools which supposed be one of the better schools in the area and i thought there would be all sorts of creative things going on and there was not it was still read the chapter write the answers to the question at the end of the book and i thought how boring i mean there are different ways to get kids turned on to things um i am not sure there is so much influence once 

Recording: (2110/ 2140) 
exactly 

Recording: (2111/ 2140) 
so that like it is just the sheer numbers of it i think 

Recording: (2112/ 2140) 
hum 

Recording: (2113/ 2140) 
um yeah 

Recording: (2114/ 2140)

Recording: (2123/ 2140) 
left there uh part of it was my fault i was not very good at discipline in the classroom so probably one of the biggest problems i had but uh 

Recording: (2124/ 2140) 
mean i do not see it being a problem of any sorts um i mean just as long as they have someone that cares for the kid and does stuff for them i mean i can not see it being yete 

Recording: (2125/ 2140)
