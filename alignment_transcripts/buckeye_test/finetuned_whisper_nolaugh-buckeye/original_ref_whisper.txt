Recording: (84/ 2140) 
and not that that changed my opinion of her um but back then and nobody would talk about it and you know i just think in today is world we need to bring subjects like that out no one because there is so many people who are ashamed about things and they should not be ashamed because it is a lifestyle anymore you know i just it needs to be brought up more 

Recording: (85/ 2140) 
um hum 

Recording: (86/ 2140) 
mother used to be a principal of mine in elementary school so uh he is like i think we should talk was like okay great okay so i was like boy you are way too serious for this particular affair okay that is we knew ahead of time this also coming to an end do not worry about it so i i um at this point in the story i should point out that the paper that i went downstairs for i do not know where that is i never found it never saw it never it it is anyway not relevant at all the story but it bugs me every time i tell the story because does not exist anyway 

Recording: (87/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (88/ 2140) 
lived in the dorms my freshman year and then i moved into a house with a bunch of guys i met yeah so what was different um one the things that i really enjoyed that was different is the traffic and that really no that really that really became really became uh interesting and different for me when i started working for a courier service winter quarter i took off i took all classes off winter quarter and worked for a courier service because i needed some money and i love driving and let me tell you it is really really different 

Recording: (89/ 2140) 
and there are some people that deserve to be fired and there is no way that you can really differentiate just because they are in a union they 

Recording: (90/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (91/ 2140) 
i do not there was nothing there that really i can remember that <LAUGH> did anything good for me i mean i think middle school taught me a lot more than high school 

Recording: (92/ 2140) 
the the the slick image bothers me um he has the potential of of trampling gore i think that gore will be the the nominee no matter what bradley does gore has it sewn up because he is the insider um at 

Recording: (93/ 2140) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (94/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (95/ 2140) 
right right that is right yeah so that that was an interesting and when we went to church up hamilton and over to and on morse or up new albany road to morse over to high street none of that commerical stuff was out there on morse road i do not know if you know morse road very well but there is out out out by karl there is shopping center after shopping center after shopping center <LAUGH> after housing development after but when we did 

Recording: (96/ 2140) 
to the other side 

Recording: (97/ 2140) 
terrible murderers get away with murder now by that plea bargain that plea bargain i think is the most thing that ever was passed i do not think there should be any plea bargains oh but there are people who get murdered eh and sent to the electric chair electric chair i still believe in it because if someone is and i do not believe that they should have ten years of uh what do they call that legal process where they can appeals thank you that is it 

Recording: (98/ 2140) 
yeah because i mean five years went by like <LAUGH> 

Recording: (99/ 2140) 
so 

Recording: (100/ 2140) 
oh that was the monica lewinsky 

Recording: (101/ 2140) 
you know like i told her it is the way i was raised 

Recording: (102/ 2140) 
my honor is class is challenging and organic chemistry is very challenging but 

Recording: (103/ 2140) 
she uh has trouble driving even at night and stuff like that 

Recording: (104/ 2140) 
i found out actually so so we can stop we can stop the story here or we can go on because this story it it is a fun story but 

Recording: (105/ 2140) 
and i did a lot of music interviewing and writing there and then i moved up to editor and it was sort of through that job that i got my first job with sony while i was as a as a sort of ohio representative so i was concentrated in ohio state and then you know basically it is just something i am not doing this as a career it is just sort of something i am doing in the meantime till i decide whether i am going back to school or 

Recording: (106/ 2140) 
uh she is grown uh uh she yeah she is expanded her horizons if you will and 

Recording: (107/ 2140) 
do not have any evidence to uh to support it i just know that i have it i feel that i have a distinct uh uh uh very clear distinction between what is uh fact and what is fiction what is true and what is imaginary and uh so for me i do not think that television has affected me in that way um i mean one way that television has affected me is i am full of media references 

Recording: (108/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (109/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (110/ 2140)

Recording: (120/ 2140) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (121/ 2140)

Recording: (123/ 2140) 
um yeah that is what they suggest doing is two years of med school get your p h d and then do your last two years of med school 

Recording: (124/ 2140) 
oh there always has been there always has been i think a lot of people feel that kids a lot of kids are on medication today that should not be but um i think that is the fault of the school or the parents or some doctor that like for example when we kids in worthington to a doctor we have a list of three doctors that we work with and we know that they will not just give this kid a pill if he does not have eight out of the twelve symptoms or 

Recording: (125/ 2140) 
i am sure i am sure it is you know it is just the circles i move in 

Recording: (126/ 2140) 
o s u 

Recording: (127/ 2140) 
ten years no question about it that is it you are in jail for ten years eighteen years old if you have got anything on ten years that is it you know and you look at some of these other people or like these sports people and

yeah i am a democrat and i have never voted for a republican in my life even when i lived in oregon and i always adored mark hatfield I DIDNT VOTE FOR HIM WHILE I WAS OUT THERE was the weirdest thing because i thought he was a great REPUBLICAN <LAUGH> but i think uh personally mike coleman was good i i have met uh well 

Recording: (131/ 2140) 
for that budget they bought things on a cash basis as they needed it they did not go out and spend on credit and now i mean i am jumping ahead of myself here but business said hey let us produce these lines little lady you want a refrigerator we can make it for you and we can make it cheap for you because we can mass produce it 

Recording: (132/ 2140) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (133/ 2140) 
i mean i did not have the greatest childhood i do not think any of us ever really had the best you know but but i do not like i would not talk to my kid the way some of these people talk to them but um one today you know and she got on the bus and the little girl went and set over here she is probably about eight maybe six or something like that and she wanted to set here her mommy so she made her set with her which is cool and mommy just goes to sleep and the little kid is trying to study her homework you know

uh his mother died um the week after we got married she had diabetes um uh juvenile diabetes diagnosed at age eleven and just over the years um ended up having open heart surgery and did not make it through the surgery my grandmother also died during open heart surgery so my perception of open heart surgery even though i am a nurse <LAUGH> IS not very good just because of the two 

Recording: (137/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (138/ 2140) 
deep space nine in that uh they address the issue of different people living and working different people of different i mean these were aliens rather than different ethnic denominations of humans but it it approached that from a less um from uh a more realistic standpoint in instead of having it you know like an old star trek you know everyone gets along then we come 

Recording: (139/ 2140) 
um originally north side 

Recording: (140/ 2140) 
son now oh i saw him when let us see he was fifteen maybe he would run across the street when martha the eighty six year old lady across was trying to bring her garbage down he would seen me do that go oh let me get that for you martha she is got arthritis she looks like she is gonna fall she takes steps about this big and i have seen him do that 

Recording: (141/ 2140) 
then you are really gonna get out of it what you need to 

Recording: (142/ 2140) 
store to um buy a swimsuit my sophomore year and he was a cashier there 

Recording: (143/ 2140) 
inadequate but the uh that was even through nursing school i mean those were not things that were discussed you go to special conferences to get information on that 

Recording: (144/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (145/ 2140) 
umhum yeah 

Recording: (146/ 2140) 
uh 

Recording: (147/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (148/ 2140) 
umhum <LAUGH> 

Recording: (149/ 2140) 
yeah i like that 

Recording: (150/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (151/ 2140) 
yeah but i have got more influence i think maybe i am not sure i am hoping i have got more influence over him than his father does 

Recording: (152/ 2140) 
yeah i mean i want to see how the season ends out it is just a lot of the one is this season to me have just been disappointing the i mean i think every show sort of has a peak some shows peak towards the end some at the beginning and sort of level off i mean the the simpsons had a stretch from like their third year through like their seventh where things were just like unbelievably funny and then they had some writing changes i think and this this season is just 

Recording: (153/ 2140) 
and we started talking again and it was just like we had not missed any time and started dating 

Recording: (154/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (155/ 2140) 
where as i do not know lutheran is a little bit more open to 

Recording: (156/ 2140) 
so we have really never had a lot of use for the union but recently we just figured out that you KNOW if they decide to strike we have no choice too and you can not work because they will take all the money you make crossing that lines so you cannot work anybody that came back to work will lose all the money that they made they will take them to court and they will yeah it is against yeah it is against the union contracts so you have just 

Recording: (157/ 2140) 
yeah i 

Recording: (158/ 2140) 
um i think that i do not think that divorce is a bad thing i think that it is if you are married and you realize that you get to a point where you and this other person are are not in a positive relationship for each other or for anybody else in your family that it is better to just say look this is not WORKING we both deserve to be happy and we and and and go your own SEPARATE ways um i 

Recording: (159/ 2140) 
it kind of YEAH <LAUGH> <LAUGH> well i have seen worser SO <LAUGH> um so i they are doing this i think it is called sit and reach where he is got to sit on the floor and he is got to raise his feet up just so and and he is got to take his hands and reach towards his toes and he they do that for you know like five minutes first time and they increase it and he really hates it 

Recording: (160/ 2140) 
but then that hurts the the the administrators in a sense that they are there to provide an education so it would be rough in like my high school they they put up cameras andtheyhadlike they locked bathrooms like at certain times you could not go in them and like it was getting and they had like we were on the front page the akron beacon journal because they had a lock down where no one was allowed to leave their classroom and then they brought this the dogs through and they found i 

Recording: (161/ 2140) 
you can not you can not be mad at somebody for choosing a lifestyle you just can not life is too short you know i mean you can love them either way it does not make any difference 

Recording: (162/ 2140) 
the that is why it is mainly appealing to in state people you they pay you to go to school 

Recording: (163/ 2140) 
i forget they have the like way more than like they dwarf any other state i think so that to me is not that is not admirable and then i so the that is one reason i would not vote for bush 

Recording: (164/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (165/ 2140)

Recording: (227/ 2140) 
going to do and if boy if they say then they really make it so and ask them two or three times on tape that they understand this before they sign this even well then how could they say that they uh they have got to come up with new rules and they got to make the penalties stick 

Recording: (228/ 2140) 
well unfortunately i do not think it is fair but i think in the long run it does not have to be a college education because most of those people probably would not want a college education um but like a trade or a skill or something it will give them a little bit of hope if they do wanna choose to get a job instead of robbing a bank or selling drugs or whatever they did they have that choice it is it is it is up in their head okay i can either go become a welder or 

Recording: (229/ 2140) 
in the business world in other words i used to work uh during uh highschool days for a furniture company and back in those days it was nine days cash and we would sell it to people and the and i said well gee we just and we talked to the manager oh they they do not have the they do not have the money that is financed the bank well why are we selling it to them then well we will get our money back and the bank bank get the money and we will get a we will repossess it and we sold the same darn thing over three or four times

no no um my i was born in new york i was not playing um i then went to tennessee with my family an that was after i was six months old 

Recording: (233/ 2140) 
i you know from my perspective which is skewed of course to me i think it just seems that way i mean it was we are only talking about ten cases that is not very many you know i mean you could by coincidence have them all be african american um if i were african american i think i would have a different perspective and i you know i do not do not live in a neighborhood where we see a lot of police so uh you know i just do not i am i am not in touch with it with 

Recording: (234/ 2140) 
um sector and i think that is a good sign but i think there is a huge there is millions of children that do not have any healthcare and that is not right there is like there is a lot of like between the lower and the upper there is a huge disparity but at least it is a step in the right direction we have a a nice solid middle middle middle income base i think because a lot of countries only have the like i visited mexico and seems like they only had the distinction between the upper and lower i mean their middle class is very small and that uh 

Recording: (235/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (236/ 2140) 
well 

Recording: (237/ 2140)

Recording: (238/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (239/ 2140) 
um well actually it is sort of all happening in a certain area you know with you know very high unemployment like council council states um you know the sort of stereotype you know kind of bad family environment you know parents have lots of boyfriends and girlfriends drugs everything else and you know a lot of these girls that have been interviewed 

Recording: (240/ 2140) 
were like oh english people your accent is so neat and all that kind of thing and then when i went there you know i and this was actually one of my friends but i remember you know she was german and she was sort of asking me how you say different words and things and then she sort of looked at me and she said like oh actually i should not be asking you i do not wanna learn the american way to say those like i wanna learn the british way to and people would say things all the time and it was you know they would ask you what your background was and if you would say well i am american they said well you know like where your 

Recording: (241/ 2140) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (242/ 2140) 
as far as i was concerned for what they were doing um you know one one principal that from my um daughter is high school he was out partying all the time they you know they he was he was riding around in a corvette and uh he tried to take me out 

Recording: (243/ 2140) 
yeah exactly pass through it random jobs for 

Recording: (244/ 2140) 
they went they went to private schools they went to private schools i certainly did not want them to go to public schools and even when going to ohio state um compared to miami university i saw a difference i see a differences in the standards of the of the students uh but i believe and i have seen it with my son going to ohio state that his morals that he is gained through his uh precollege years are staying with him uh and i am very grateful that there is 

Recording: (245/ 2140) 
or to do anything extreme to their bodies 

Recording: (246/ 2140) 
and everything that the they will tend to talk to maybe you or talk to somebody else and uh a like an authoritative figure and not believe a damn word they say 

Recording: (247/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (248/ 2140) 
uh fifty percent of uh everyone who marries has divorced within a matter of about five years as i understand the statistics today and uh unfortunately it is still increasing but there is a strong feeling that maybe this is going to slowly reverse or at least decrease not reverse probably um once again we are talking about communications too uh and the communications can be ill and they can be great uh as she is touched 

Recording: (249/ 2140) 
to crystal clarity and they will just run with it and that is what my mom came out of um her her denomination that she came out of she is not part of it any more denomination she came out of it um some of the more devout churches within the apostolic christian church we are talking men sit on one side women sit on the other women wear little thingies on their heads no jewelry the sermon is read in three different languages 

Recording: (250/ 2140) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (251/ 2140) 
umhum umhum well you you had a had a good reason be bothered 

Recording: (252/ 2140) 
because then you know what if something major happens that fourth time then what but i think i at least for children especially because they have no means to to help themselves and like the parents obviously even if they are working a lot of times can not get healthcare for their children so i think at least for children because how many accidents happen to children like people are always breaking arms and stuff 

Recording: (253/ 2140) 
that they wanted to save this white girl because i had so much potential and uh they were not going to let me throw my life away like this so i was you know it is bizarre and so i was always from that time on i decided these these people are all crazy i am never gonna i am never gonna be like that and so i have a whole lot of different values from my family and it is real hard for them because all my other siblings who are younger are willing to 

Recording: (254/ 2140) 
yeah yeah i think so yeah 

Recording: (255/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (256/ 2140) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (257/ 2140)

i never learned math <LAUGH> we had in our fifth grade we had the principal realized that nobody knew their times tables he had a big pizza party planned for 

Recording: (259/ 2140) 
it is a lot of money 

Recording: (260/ 2140) 
yeah probably cause we have some public systems most of them are for the librarians but there is some for public too 

Recording: (261/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (262/ 2140) 
just 

Recording: (263/ 2140)

Recording: (269/ 2140) 
i mean i i i mean that probably can be proven i do not know if anybody would do any decent studies on it i just bet you a million dollars that you know it would be the influence of tv you know the and then and another thing that is well tv is the uh where it comes from but like the kids are all into pokemon right now 

Recording: (270/ 2140) 
less fortunate out there and that there is little things we can do 

Recording: (271/ 2140) 
and my sister was here like i said and then moved out just gotten came back a couple months ago um my grandfather just passed away but he was here in a nursing home for about a year 

Recording: (272/ 2140) 
like if we if america you know we are we are used to being raised one way if we went to another country just kind of like you might wanna get to know the chinese people but you might not quite be a little timid about you know kind of thing but i i am not i do not have any of those barriers 

Recording: (273/ 2140) 
yeah uh i was i think that he is he is right that our my generation was more uh oh i want to do not want to say spiritual but more morally uh well directed than

because heck you know it is a it is sydney it is is uh that is like a that is like a tourist place 

Recording: (279/ 2140) 
i do think there is some and i do not think they probably get exposed to like the different walks of life i do not think they probably be exposed to you know the gay lesbian uh i think that would probably just be blown over and they did not go very much in depth you know about sex and your sex ed classes were pretty but on the other hand for me that was fine i do not know our friends it is have eleven year old that is going to public school i mean he had a parenting class already where he had to carry 

Recording: (280/ 2140) 
yep i have heard that too i just differ it is different and you know i keep trying to figure out now was it worse when they were this age or is this worse you know you know now then you can talk to some other people that are oh you have not seen anything yet wait until they just do not even want to be in sight with you and do not wait till they you know i am not going on a vacation with you i 

Recording: (281/ 2140) 
i think you just have to treat children like they are just just you have to respect them and you have to not not talk down to them and and that whole thing about you know why can not i do this well because i told you so

at each other is throat for this that and the other and and you know devon is uh my daughter is the one that really got put in the middle of it you know and probably it was a blessing that they moved to saint louis because there probably could have been more uh problems legal problems you know as far as uh going back and forth to court and putting her on the witness stand for stupid stuff you know and so uh in hindsight it was kind of a blessing that they moved there 

Recording: (285/ 2140)

<LAUGH> and it it is kind of weird because you when i went from middle school to high school it was like a big growing up period and i see them like what are you doing that for 

Recording: (320/ 2140) 
sounds a lot like our dog 

Recording: (321/ 2140) 
and the um that was part of the process there to how to work work and work up there too with people but if we could just share more 

Recording: (322/ 2140) 
have those apostles and to have the the church set up like it was and it must have been really strong because it is still lasted all the same catholic and all the orthodox churches still carry all these beliefs 

Recording: (323/ 2140) 
they are normal people just outside of their sexual well majority of the people prefer heterosexual 

Recording: (324/ 2140) 
hm 

Recording: (325/ 2140) 
well this is about giving opinions and my opinion about the columbus public school system really is not good 

Recording: (326/ 2140) 
um but they always say do not let the animals sleep with you and all that and with a cat and they curl up with you it is hard to say GE <LAUGH> no but you know what honestly eventually well it it took probably a year 

Recording: (327/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (328/ 2140) 
really and it is a fun job it really is i i have only ever known one male that taught first grade and i knew one guy that taught third most the time if they go in to elementary ed they go for the upper grades like four five or six but um i really think that if we let the boys be more exposed to men earlier then they would be more motivated to learn because they would see that it is not just a girly thing 

Recording: (329/ 2140) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (330/ 2140) 
yes 

Recording: (331/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (332/ 2140) 
if it were possible i think that a lot of parents are trying to raise them what they think is the best right now and that is another problem it seemed like the way the world has come up and everything else the way the cost of living has increased it almost takes two parents in that home if you wanna really live a half way decent life and be able to do some of the extra things no one wants to live and only have to be able to just use like you SAID the necessities 

Recording: (333/ 2140) 
yeah where they need it right 

Recording: (334/ 2140) 
you know 

Recording: (335/ 2140) 
you know he says that e equals m c squared i say it is e equals m c cubed because the the world is three dimensional it is not two dimensional uh two dimensional limits everything but you look at his theory of relativity all of our mathematical theorems physical theorems on physics and things of that nature have been based off that 

Recording: (336/ 2140) 
now is when i need to be OFF with them you know where we can take them out and run 

Recording: (337/ 2140) 
for parties so because it is actually a market it is all done outside like tonight we are going to the uh galberth pavilion which is um next to the ohio theater it is really beautiful and people do a lot of parties there 

Recording: (338/ 2140) 
and he did that too uh 

Recording: (339/ 2140) 
like dealing the with this adoption of the baby we know that that is best but dealing with the emotions of it this is a you know it is grand we are very family oriented and it is this is a grandchild we will never see 

Recording: (340/ 2140) 
and just totally bombarded and i mean here it is so force fed as well i mean i i came home just before halloween and you know i i walked into the grocery store and i mean just like right there were just like cakes cupcakes cookies like everything just right in front of you with like all this halloween stuff on and i mean all the holidays in here are so pushed at you and it is such a money making you know and it is so over the top where there it is sort of like there is a little bit of that and there are decorations and 

Recording: (341/ 2140) 
if you just look at the nature of what they are doing it is just 

Recording: (342/ 2140) 
umhum yeah well it was like i kind of just like stopped going to class and and like and then i just like ended up withdrawing because i would have like failed everything anyways but um yeah then i was living with my friend for awhile um but and then like now me and her and my other friend live in down on maynard 

Recording: (343/ 2140) 
and then they are gonna say they wanna nail their parents you know their parents are sitting at home they have no idea what their kid is doing 

Recording: (344/ 2140) 
right well kind of like just because everybody else is doing it this way does not mean it is the right way and um yeah you know i really struggle with that because i i come more from i think the family should teach it but let us be realistic how many families are gonna do that or have the mentality to do that it seems like um <LAUGH> sound like my dad BUT IT SEEMS like these days most of the people a lot of people that are having kids 

Recording: (345/ 2140) 
which would um see with those guns our of ours we figured within ten ten yards was a hit was a and because if you had one of those things thirty seven pounds of t n t go off within ten yards of it <LAUGH> 

Recording: (346/ 2140) 
yeah i just renewed my certification certificate last year so i MAY GET BACK INTO IT part of the reason i renewed my certificate was i did some home instruction with the columbus public schools last year and that is kind of like a tutoring job where you can go you can arrange hours with a student that is at home for some reason um i had one that just had a baby <LAUGH> and um they it is an interesting job because they look for somebody that can cover 

Recording: (347/ 2140) 
run quick <LAUGH> put plastic up oh i do not know it seemed like it is a tough call because it is very unusual situation here at ohio state where they have a union and they have so many different skills in a union you think of unions you think of autoworkers you think of pipefitters you think of you do not think of such a wide variety of 

Recording: (348/ 2140) 
the one that is eighteen now i thought he was gonna be left handed up until he was like four because his dad is left handed my sister is left handed i have one left handed parent well all of sudden one day he picked up the thing with the right hand and he is been with his right hand ever since so you really can not tell because they they are pretty much either or until they are about five 

Recording: (349/ 2140) 
um i mean columbus public they they got some work to do too like the other night i was watching tv and uh an elementary school overdosed a kid on like some a i think it was a drug to calm him down so he is not so hyper and they like overdosed him like twice in a day and then when he goes home his mom is even overdosing him because he they are overdosing him 

Recording: (350/ 2140) 
i do not know i would like to think i would like to say no sitting here but you never know because i guess that is cause that is what happens to a lot of them you know they they come out of school all idealistic and then they go into industry and then they are molded and assuming they make upper management there is you want the tax breaks you want you know what i mean and then they uh like i have an uncle who is a vice president on wall street for merrill lynch and he said you know he he got out of school he was very idealistic but now he 

Recording: (351/ 2140) 
sure you you know you do something with them but this group the the middle thirties i call them you had to massage them and that is what clinton did so well and that is what dole could have done i am not sure if george w is gonna be able to uh because to get the the nomination eventually he is gonna come out and have to make his hard statements to those people which is i am anti abortion i am pro gun he is already said the pro gun and that is because it is going against what most americans are saying dole i think represented where most americans 

Recording: (352/ 2140) 
oh yeah yeah 

Recording: (353/ 2140) 
first quarter 

Recording: (354/ 2140) 
and uh i think uh some of my feelings about that sort of thing is uh is is colored by the fact that i collected data for twenty years from employers uh i am a lot more sympathetic to that sort of thing um yeah just lot more sympathetic to people collecting data 

Recording: (355/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (356/ 2140) 
whoa um 

Recording: (357/ 2140)

Recording: (364/ 2140)

um hum 

Recording: (376/ 2140) 
well i do not know if it is monroe county or

Recording: (378/ 2140) 
yeah as i was teasing HM 

Recording: (379/ 2140) 
i know

Recording: (382/ 2140) 
the priest they had there would not let him take communion and all the other kids were taking communion and that is pretty much the priest decides that and he and he felt singled out and he was i mean he was the only one and he was uncomfortable with that uh but it has not been a problem uh i am not a religious person myself but i am not against it and if i and maybe i have justified it to myself by saying well they are teaching values 

Recording: (383/ 2140) 
it is a no it is a uh clinical study where we are seeing how treadmill training effects ambulation in people with spinal cord injury 

Recording: (384/ 2140) 
on the spur of the moment i would have to think about that i really would 

Recording: (385/ 2140)

Recording: (392/ 2140) 
in the kin 

Recording: (393/ 2140) 
i think it has changed drastically and i think it is changing and i think it will also be changing in the future uh going all the way back uh finances uh were were not a consideration in the in oh i would say probably my first thirty maybe even forty years there was some there was influence but i think the influence was not financial it was influence from the person who could get up here and talk with a group of people and sway them with 

Recording: (394/ 2140) 
is that right 

Recording: (395/ 2140) 
sure 

Recording: (396/ 2140) 
exactly 

Recording: (397/ 2140) 
you get into a situation where you really where there is a no win situation from the get go and uh uh i think that had we been able to do what we went over there to do initially it would have worked out okay but we were not so so it became a political war as everybody knows that knows anything about it 

Recording: (398/ 2140) 
a ways to go it is getting better 

Recording: (399/ 2140) 
it is it is 

Recording: (400/ 2140)

Recording: (404/ 2140) 
and my but now my daughter is my daughter has twin sons who just are a year out of college and uh i think that they are they one of them particularly is i think in good moral good sort of guy and the other one i do not feel like i know as well but

Recording: (406/ 2140) 
um 

Recording: (407/ 2140) 
<LAUGH> there is a lot we need to do a lot of evolving <LAUGH> we DEFINITELY do 

Recording: (408/ 2140) 
well i think it was then a nice thing about we had uh we had uh grandparents that were not necessarily they were out of state in some cases we did not see them that much we made a part that uh we communicated with the grandparents regularly and when we did it was a special time we um emphasized the fact that um uh you know kids wanna do certain things okay they saw their mother go out and maybe do some additional things to 

Recording: (409/ 2140) 
um hum 

Recording: (410/ 2140) 
to take this class like i think that if i uh but i mean it is good to being forced to take a like a liberal arts thing because like you do not know what you wanna do so it is like if like you hate math and you do not take it at all but then you decide you wanna do something in math then you are like screwed like can not go back 

Recording: (411/ 2140) 
like the continent 

Recording: (412/ 2140) 
not really 

Recording: (413/ 2140) 
um well as far as my mom goes she is real into the catholic faith and i mean she made me always go to church and things like that 

Recording: (414/ 2140) 
um hum 

Recording: (415/ 2140) 
but it and it is it is parents that fight for the society and the what is in your community you know the parents for each individual child they have to all form together as a group and almost be all parents to all these kids as a group you know it is not you can be the best parent in the world at home and then your kid goes to school and it accesses the computer or they get in a group of kids where their parents they do not even know where they are you know it is the kids responsibility to get and go to school you know maybe the mom and 

Recording: (416/ 2140) 
home we interact the school is great you have people that are on the clock oh time to quit they are gone those people do not know meaning of life they will never know the meaning of life but if they stay around try to extend themselves little more with somebody that is having problems at work and are willing to work with that person i did not say willing to work not knowing they are going to be compensated because they will be compensated 

Recording: (417/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (418/ 2140) 
like there two fisherman that found him at sea you never hear about the other one because that this was on one just briefly i heard on the news because he thinks he should go back to his father but you do not hear about him there is three cousins two of them think he should stay miami the other one thinks he should go back with his father you do not hear about him i was reading about him news week or someplace uh so i think the news media is not been totally objective about this 

Recording: (419/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (420/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (421/ 2140)

Recording: (422/ 2140) 
how many times you have been in ireland 

Recording: (423/ 2140) 
if they had a way to cure it then fine but leave that up to the people 

Recording: (424/ 2140) 
that is how i feel that is that is what i BELIEVE i choose to believe that <LAUGH> 

Recording: (425/ 2140) 
well uh it is like the 

Recording: (426/ 2140) 
this just can not go on not that they are going to stop it totally 

Recording: (427/ 2140) 
gonna be a really busy day and i would the same thing at port columbus you know i i would see all these cars but it would be just about the same traffic and i am like and i mentioned somebody i go where are the extra airplanes and they go they can not add extra airplanes it is they have certain routes they can do they just hafta put bigger airplanes on so he said you know you will see larger airplanes when it is holiday time so they can put more people on so 

Recording: (428/ 2140)

Recording: (432/ 2140) 
yeah so she said she is gonna be catching the disability bus out here you know after a certain amount of time she is gonna ride that bus 

Recording: (433/ 2140) 
or more accurately i think she took it but it is a fine line um and so she wears that around and i replaced it so i had my own again i wear this one around so we have a competition to see who can get the most well traveled ring you get two points for every country and you get one point for every state or province within that country

Recording: (437/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (438/ 2140) 
okay that is kind of 

Recording: (439/ 2140) 
what we should buy yeah the retailer what we should buy and that is the problem we listen to business too much if business reemphasized their goals to help society out and not themselves 

Recording: (440/ 2140) 
and i think um of course we would all hope that abortion would not be that that nobody would have an abortion that would be the perfect world because nobody would ever be in a situation where they would need one um but i also think uh you know i i mean yeah there should not be there should not should not spend six weeks on abortion OR six weeks on what to do if you are pregnant um but but i think the subject has to be mentioned just just in passing 

Recording: (441/ 2140) 
i think for the most part people could handle it um obviously i think probably more the older generations would be the ones that would have the bigger problem with it the ones that grew up like during the whole black rights movements and things like that um i could see them having a problem with it but i mean more like more the generations of today or whatever like basically anyone under the age of about forty or fifty or so i think that they could probably deal with it i mean i do not think it 

Recording: (442/ 2140) 
you know mean i liked earl bruce and i uh waited on him a couple times at a restaurant i worked at he was the nicest man and when they did that i do not know if you know about that when they fired him the day before the michigan game for having a nine to three season three years in a row they fired him the day before that game

i think so i think so if you are willing and you know anybody who is willing to put out the effort i mean you do have to you know that you have to sell yourself there is you know you are not gonna just sit around and wait to be discovered but um if you put out the effort i really i do not think there is that kind of that kind of discrimination anymore 

Recording: (469/ 2140) 
yeah that and i think i i am a firm believer that uh little subtleties like that to yourself are much better than look in the mirror and going look at them hips and you go this one you go i am getting a gut and you know it is like that is so negative to would you tell your mom that you know 

Recording: (470/ 2140)

Recording: (485/ 2140) 
short uh essay for for a test and um but the way that i would grade those would be pretty scientific i think you know i would come up with a rubric and i would say you you need to have you need to mention certain things and i will give certain points for your mentioning certain things <LAUGH> yeah i have i have never been a i have never been a teacher where whose had to assign or grade creative writing <LAUGH> IM NOT SURE I WOULD KNOW HOW TO DO THAT yeah <LAUGH> 

Recording: (486/ 2140) 
you know talk to her but people do not when i was fourteen i did not care what anybody told me i was gonna do it no matter what 

Recording: (487/ 2140) 
yeah i think i got really good uh um i have actually been sitting thinking about it like what departments in school were good and which ones were not um the foreign language is really good they have immersion classes from like at second level 

Recording: (488/ 2140) 
i will raise him the best way i can 

Recording: (489/ 2140) 
uh it counts if you are touching the ground or if something that you are sitting on is touching 

Recording: (490/ 2140) 
um actually i was over there when all of that happened but of course it was all over the papers and you know i think i mean i i would i do not know what it was like really here i can imagine but i mean there especially they really focused on um not columbine but the one with the the younger kids in arkansas was it the year before i was there for both of those but you know in the first one you know they they put the picture of the little kid in combat gear holding the gun everywhere 

Recording: (491/ 2140) 
let us watch seven of nine 

Recording: (492/ 2140) 
yeah it was real fun real fun i discreetly got him kicked out of the dorm he still does not know it was me but <LAUGH> yeah <LAUGH> he still does not know it was me but he and i are still on speaking terms which is which is fascinating um but uh you know i mean our first day i walked in he said hey i am tom you ever smoked pot before i was like no he said heck we got a whole year together and and i am directly quoting that this the first thing he said to me that is the first thing 

Recording: (493/ 2140) 
and uh the second tornado it was not as bad i mean as we was driving up after he uh ripped me off and he said well i am taking your sorry ass back to columbus and i said ok go for it and just sitting there smiling all the way up know knowing what he did not know we get to tennessee and uh you know uh weather is kind of bad there too i am like hey man slow down you know you do not have any windshield wipers in the middle of this rainstorm 

Recording: (494/ 2140) 
RIGHT <LAUGH> 

Recording: (495/ 2140) 
i hope so yeah <LAUGH> 

Recording: (496/ 2140) 
and so i think it gets driven home i think the media does that in a lotta places they pick something that is sensational and keep they are making it even more sensational like when uh uh john kennedy died 

Recording: (497/ 2140) 
it is really beautiful out there we like we like mountains and you know walking around uh we got married in lake tahoe which is really beautiful 

Recording: (498/ 2140) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (499/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (500/ 2140) 
he is a picky eater which he is yep he he does not like everything 

Recording: (501/ 2140) 
like it is everything pretty i mean like basic stuff that you it would be at like you know like a lazarus or something like that you know or a bunch different places you know like electronics uh appliances uh uh 

Recording: (502/ 2140) 
if there were any germans in there i will bet they scared THEM <LAUGH> 

Recording: (503/ 2140) 
and i would just hear things 

Recording: (504/ 2140) 
umhum me too 

Recording: (505/ 2140) 
um i am a lutheran and a lot of what he says about everyone going to hell 

Recording: (506/ 2140) 
as back into into high school 

Recording: (507/ 2140) 
um neither one of them is married or has kids uh my sister does boyfriend for um probably like three years or so and there is talk about them like marriage and kids and stuff like that with them 

Recording: (508/ 2140) 
you know the crime you can not really stop and other things that happen just you know too much partying around i mean that is why i left twelfth AVENUE because i could not you know but you know just everybody uh the neighbors being loud and everything and my mom is older so she can not really put up with any of that and 

Recording: (509/ 2140) 
like i am not i am not really sure like how they how the interview works to become a teacher um i do not know i think it is like a lot of times they are really desperate to find and so they really just take whoever i mean they are lucky enough to even have a body to fill the place and they are doing well enough i mean the kids are learning the material i mean sort of i mean i mean i it is working well enough i guess 

Recording: (510/ 2140) 
north 

Recording: (511/ 2140) 
that is goes with the disorder they know they know when who is button to push and when not to push a button and how far they can go and you know where the line is and they push you always that is why teachers they uh they drive the teacher up the wall 

Recording: (512/ 2140) 
i think society is today of today is less tolerant of uh a lot of things that they see where getting by with stuff you know and they are more vocal about it as opposed to being violent about it back in the sixties and stuff you know uh not here but you know down south there were people still getting hung and stuff you know for being a black or something and uh know there are bad blacks and there is bad whites too you know so but 

Recording: (513/ 2140) 
well 

Recording: (514/ 2140) 
i 

Recording: (515/ 2140) 
you know so you can use all those opportunities to show your kid what not to do 

Recording: (516/ 2140) 
well i mean to me the whole thing is wrong regardless of if you are guilty or innocent there to me there is worse things i would think than than dying you know you like i know in israel the guy who killed yitzhak rabin he got locked up and he is not allowed to see uh because uh um under jewish law you can not kill 

Recording: (517/ 2140) 
and now it is our turn to deal with the issues we see our parents we see this generation that all these things that are still popular it is that we do not look down on the sixties i mean i think the sixties sounded like a pretty fun time to live i would get into politics in a second um but those things are popularized but no we can not do it anymore because we got all these problems 

Recording: (518/ 2140) 
because they would not let them when i was there 

Recording: (519/ 2140)

Recording: (523/ 2140) 
umhum hum 

Recording: (524/ 2140) 
i i think i like that how it is kept with a sort of i tension and it is not like they are not completely thrown together like uh belanna and tom which i do not like that at all 

Recording: (525/ 2140)

microsoft linux uh i do not know i think linux will be around forever just because it is such a stable system that is so good and yeah and macintosh will stay around forever just because macintosh is invincible umhum umhum after the big hype of the i mac and it did not do as good as it nearly as good as they thought it was gonna do even

Recording: (531/ 2140) 
wow 

Recording: (532/ 2140) 
the problem is lack of commitment the lack of commitment and not saying hey there is a niche for you you can not be a male oh yeah you wanna do the operation i can not be feeling yeah you wanna do well why not be happy what you are god made you what you are why not make you the complete person you are and not strive for something you can not be

yeah 

Recording: (543/ 2140) 
i think there might be but i think most of them are a dying breed they are the older citizens um many in my generation uh they would just probably be because i am i am the early baby boom i am i am the first of the baby boom uh and that is when the woman is movement started and many men there still have not always accepted that so there there might be a problem there but for the the the the generations even the later baby boom generations behind me when i talk to them i talk to uh high school students or even young college students 

Recording: (544/ 2140) 
no no they did not um did not pay for grading or preparing your classes or or researching anything <LAUGH> so right but but still even though it was real very much underpaid job i i liked it when i did it um i liked the introduction to the arts class because i had to develop my own curriculum for it <LAUGH> RIGHT they had a when they told me i i 

Recording: (545/ 2140) 
UH HUH 

Recording: (546/ 2140) 
the beginning of the end <LAUGH> yep um grew up in upper arlington not far yeah really those five miles make such a difference though like because i yeah because i live on campus

Recording: (550/ 2140) 
and so you had 

Recording: (551/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (552/ 2140) 
direction that is being put or they are being pushed 

Recording: (553/ 2140)

Recording: (562/ 2140) 
well think a little bit safer idea than uh eliminating guns because you know there is always gonna be weapons out there instead of eliminating the problem you know more centralize it make it a national law that you hafta be a certain age give a certain time period for your background checks and whatever else kind of record finding they need make sure you are 

Recording: (563/ 2140) 
a commodore sixty four is they have heard of it but they really do not know what a brilliant system it was at it is uh in in it is initial stage and it just got bowled over because you know something better came out something better will come out than windows microsoft will eventually go under it is just gonna take a while uh yeah oh yeah i do not i give it probably about six or seven years before for before somebody comes out with a system that is just as good as

Recording: (645/ 2140) 
well according to the government she would have 

Recording: (646/ 2140) 
that once you filter it through something it looks different but previous to that yeah there is a lot there there is way too much shared experience to to gloss over effectively so when she said look if you never listen to anything else that i say you will listen to this you need to go to europe i was like okay i will go to europe 

Recording: (647/ 2140)

Recording: (839/ 2140) 
and i do not think that it is just executed properly so i would almost rather have it not at all 

Recording: (840/ 2140) 
i i do not hate all 

Recording: (841/ 2140) 
really do not need the sweat lodge but it is there for them and they do participate um 

Recording: (842/ 2140) 
oh okay well the reason i asked was a lot it seems to me a lot of the impetus for going to church or going back to church for people is when their kid gets old enough to go to sunday school <LAUGH> starting asking questions about religion and you are saying well i suppose i could answer all of these but <LAUGH> yeah 

Recording: (843/ 2140) 
um no english 

Recording: (844/ 2140) 
i do not think so 

Recording: (845/ 2140) 
um 

Recording: (846/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (847/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (848/ 2140) 
and part of it was just being stupid but it was down around mount vernon area and uh they got very little money but i was not hurt <LAUGH> 

Recording: (849/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (850/ 2140) 
i would say and then i would also say that you know uh because uh a a a number of reasons that people do not vote for school levies now is because they do not have kids in the schools you know but education is the foundation of a democracy and if you do not have an educated citizenry uh your democracy could go down the drain um that was why thomas jefferson founded so many schools or you know the the university of virginia and believed in education you know because he said without an educated citizenry you will not understand the issues you know but 

Recording: (851/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (852/ 2140) 
with that boy 

Recording: (853/ 2140) 
humum 

Recording: (854/ 2140) 
groups and different cliques but i can not help but thinking that if it was bad enough that you would do something like that that you know had to have been more than just you know sort of normal jocks versus whatever so i think it should be more i do not know i mean even you know i went to a private 

Recording: (855/ 2140) 
and you know you can have a hard thing there but then if you teach the teachers that they are not gonna be quiet and they are not gonna you know um look at this flattery 

Recording: (856/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (857/ 2140) 
uh it sucked 

Recording: (858/ 2140) 
uh huh 

Recording: (859/ 2140) 
you know and i would not be too opposed to do that myself if it would keep the cost down around here 

Recording: (860/ 2140) 
<LAUGH> time to go ALL RIGHT IM DONE HERE <LAUGH> 

Recording: (861/ 2140)

Recording: (862/ 2140) 
it will be a long campaign i thought it was interesting that that gore suggested suggested two two debates a week and i just can not imagine watching two debates a week for months <LAUGH> YKNOW it is like well at least they could get things out into the open but i they have the chance but who wants to watch that much who has the time to watch that much 

Recording: (863/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (864/ 2140) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (865/ 2140) 
yeah not not for special conditions NOTHING just universally it is wrong

Recording: (870/ 2140) 
i have i at at one time i kind of wanted to be a teacher and everything but course that would have been i am forty nine so that would have been probably what about twenty four so would have about twenty five years in so i would be right at and ready to get the heck out anyway you know 

Recording: (871/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (872/ 2140) 
you know so basically well yeah it might work but to me it is kinda stupid you know because what you are saying is we are gonna take this law and really gonna stick you on this law but the hell with all the other laws so is that really fair 

Recording: (873/ 2140) 
long hair it was uh back in the sixties so you know 

Recording: (874/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (875/ 2140)

Recording: (876/ 2140) 
i remember it being it is a pretty positive thing for me i was never upset about the fact that they were not together because they all both gave me a lot of attention but um about i think i was maybe five or six my mom moved into apartment in german village 

Recording: (877/ 2140) 
yeah my brother well he is the oldest oldest but two sisters pretty much all the ones i really care about two sisters and their husbands 

Recording: (878/ 2140) 
expensive so everyone has a lot less and here it is like everything is so relatively inexpensive that it is like you know picture frames or something there might be you know twenty five dollars for one so you buy one here oh you know they are five dollars a piece lets buy five you know 

Recording: (879/ 2140) 
yep 

Recording: (880/ 2140) 
umhum you are going to cross the street you know four lane highway and you are sitting there going hey 

Recording: (881/ 2140) 
you but at night it is pretty fun and you just floor it and fly right through the middle of down town um improvements i would just say keep i would just say that man this place is dirty 

Recording: (882/ 2140) 
yeah well and i think chiropractors will be more popular for the same type of reason yeah huh 

Recording: (883/ 2140) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (884/ 2140) 
as he was speaking and as he started to speak i realized too another thing that i really feel has a tremendous impression on how we as people are doing here but how the politicians are is because the world in essence is getting smaller because the communication has gotten better and all these other countries and us are just like all one country anymore or something i think that is had a tremendous influence also on our politics and on we as a people 

Recording: (885/ 2140) 
see you tomorrow i mean hold them feel the warmth of the body uh hear the conversation quietly rather than uh hearing okay time to get out of here you know with a vigorous saying but with pleasant sort of remark these kind i can i could write a whole book on that on this on answer your uh but it is these kinds of things are very elementary really they are very elementary i guess to 

Recording: (886/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (887/ 2140) 
right right he would go for weeks he would get mad at me and not speak to me when i was growing up for a week or two at a time my mother would say please i changed my name when i went to college i just decided i am out of here i am everything is gone and so she would say um nancy please just talk to your father just for just for my sake please and i would think i am the child here i should not have to be the one to make peace in this family if he does not wanna talk to me i do not need him i do not have to talk to him 

Recording: (888/ 2140) 
well well it is sort of like the sociology of like cliques you know like how how that develops like how people like some people seek to like fit in like like that is a real strong uh like 

Recording: (889/ 2140) 
really yeah i do not feel old at all i mean i you know a lot of people think wow you should know what you wanna do or you know and and i guess there is different phases like uh maslow is hierarchy what is that the um the hierarchy of needs maslow anyway 

Recording: (890/ 2140) 
let him be himself be right now but 

Recording: (891/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (892/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (893/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (894/ 2140) 
well it was both really because there is kids lived there since i lived there that was thirteen years ago huh and being that long in the same neighborhood just does not really get it with me 

Recording: (895/ 2140) 
yeah from the STRIKE yeah YEAH um actually a lot of our stuff did pretty well while we were off so did not make you feel as needed as you wanted to be maybe you know yeah you know we got a lot of our buildings up and running before they went on strike and i think the bosses knew this was coming so a lot of the air conditioning was already running by then 

Recording: (896/ 2140) 
yeah exactly i know 

Recording: (897/ 2140) 
yeah umhum 

Recording: (898/ 2140) 
it is always been my feeling and and uh i try to be fair in the way i grade uh you know it is i try to be as objective as i can sometimes i because i think it is important that people learn how to write i would ask all my classes to write an essay or short 

Recording: (899/ 2140) 
YKNOW 

Recording: (900/ 2140) 
yes 

Recording: (901/ 2140) 
that is pretty extreme 

Recording: (902/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (903/ 2140) 
oh gosh 

Recording: (904/ 2140) 
check their i d is i mean the guys are trying to look older the girls are trying to look 

Recording: (905/ 2140) 
well then they had uh after that they had the lottery number and that was not if you were hot you know if you got your number was picked i mean i do not know which would be worse knowing that you are gonna get a notice and being able to prepare for it or uh because i have had friends that got uh numbers and everything you know and and getting a high number and sitting there going oh my god so 

Recording: (906/ 2140) 
um it was just yeah i guess the mafia was a big problem they just take over everything and they they do not pay their workers and most people are not mafia so they do not get paid <LAUGH> 

Recording: (907/ 2140) 
but i do know my my my brother in law mentioned to his uh parents he said gosh what a sacrifice you guys did for us and he just turned fifty and they do not have any kids and he says wow i do not know how you did it well for one thing they probably did a lot of sacrificing and when you sacrifice it becomes makes you more humble 

Recording: (908/ 2140) 
ah the younger kids would not think anything about it 

Recording: (909/ 2140) 
a type of lifestyle and that lifestyle is gone everybody is independent everybody is going their own ways and if you happen to be lucky enough to find somebody that is looking in the same direction you are and is equally as independent then might it might work but um i you know and who knows why each person gets divorced i mean each one of them was an individual situation and uh 

Recording: (910/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (911/ 2140) 
umhum the watch towers yeah you kind of like you know looking up and says you know is anybody is you know got there sights on me yeah it is because that is a it is like you know like you know that is like the world war two stuff you know there is like the remains of it sure but it is like you get to see the wall it is like there it i mean it is i am sure there is like the there is uh the the what from what i understand there was like 

Recording: (912/ 2140) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (913/ 2140) 
so however this works out you know i do not know i am just i am just like okay she just does i just want to get it over with and see now she you know 

Recording: (914/ 2140) 
oh really 

Recording: (915/ 2140) 
to be close so i did not have to drive <LAUGH> 

Recording: (916/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (917/ 2140) 
see that is great though 

Recording: (918/ 2140) 
um so i mean basically my opinion on that is just leave it up to them i mean if they wanna take the risks obviously they know <LAUGH> 

Recording: (919/ 2140) 
if you if if if you say buy buy from those unscrupulous business people and say ah gee these guys got it on credit yeah what happens to that person that files bankruptcy ah file bankruptcy it is okay i will do something else next time 

Recording: (920/ 2140) 
well i already think that is happening right now because i think that i do not know what the divorce statistics have been recently but i do see that more people who are getting married are staying married because those that would do not those that would have gotten a divorce they are not bothering to get married to begin with they are just living together and if they separate so what and i think that 

Recording: (921/ 2140) 
yeah and it it has the least amount of people which is kind of neat as far as tourism so 

Recording: (922/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (923/ 2140) 
i am looking for a part time job as we speak i have been like doing temporary on and off and the thing with that is you could work you know for four five months and then nothing and then just like that so right now i am looking for something permanent 

Recording: (924/ 2140) 
you know it just experiencing someone for who they are and so she is 

Recording: (925/ 2140) 
couple restaurants or something but i mean it is it is different when you think of other cities you know it is more of like a downtown is where you go to hang out but here it is like campus or more of a 

Recording: (926/ 2140) 
it was just so i did not object to that one at all 

Recording: (927/ 2140) 
that that would be seriously fun but uh it depends if you work industry you get money 

Recording: (928/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (929/ 2140) 
really 

Recording: (930/ 2140) 
and they were just wild you know i just ran every minute and i took it as a substitute and did not know from day to day you know whether was gonna keep it i finally had to say i cant do this twenty seven kindergarteners i am sorry i can not do this BY MYSELF <LAUGH> 

Recording: (931/ 2140) 
um me or 

Recording: (932/ 2140) 
yeah drugs right yeah so that is what she is interested in right now she is looking to see if she can find someplace to work this summer even if it is just a day a week some clinic or something just to to see whats goes on day to day 

Recording: (933/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (934/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (935/ 2140) 
uh it is bishop it is a now you are you are not from around here so it is like it is a catholic school over on the west side 

Recording: (936/ 2140) 
you know and i just told him well it has to do with my belief system so you are in violation of the first amendment you know so and then they realized that i was not stupid so you know they just made things more and more difficult for me you know so i just decided to since they were not gonna change i was just gonna leave you know but so it is you know it is it is a hard way you choose to walk uh if you are not idealistic person it is i mean just more so 

Recording: (937/ 2140) 
it any worse than baseball cards or you know 

Recording: (938/ 2140) 
and you said do not we divorce more acceptable divorce should never be acceptable 

Recording: (939/ 2140) 
yeah i had a cousin that went on she she was in school for that and um as you could tell i like to do office work i 

Recording: (940/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (941/ 2140) 
yeah that is how he gets so much money he says i will be paid this much and i will be given this many um had this much minimum per day or i am not working for you and they usually say no no no we will not do that you know and then they will call back a week later okay we will take you <LAUGH> he has some really good stories about that oh yeah he has qualifications businesses and also with uh unix which is 

Recording: (942/ 2140) 
mm 

Recording: (943/ 2140) 
<LAUGH> whole lot more places to live seems like everywhere i turn there is construction and and you know you go down one one road and then you wait a couple years if you do not go in that area and it is all changed looks all different so and that is mainly like looking at bethel and three fifteen north things like that 

Recording: (944/ 2140) 
you know he was in oh yep they both worked during college i guess my dad was on the g i bill after the war so that is how he got in here had to work some part time work to get his degree umhum it is just east broad street just franklin park conservatory 

Recording: (945/ 2140) 
i mean that goes along with my customs and beliefs i mean were going to send our child i already know to parochial schools there is no way i am going to send him to a public school and even my my husband is a um boy scout um leader and just listening to the boys there he he did a program last night on respect 

Recording: (946/ 2140) 
the ultimate would probably be a part time thing you know if but neither one of our positions offer any type of part time work we have some friends that do that where they only go two days a week or something which is they get a little bit of both the worlds so 

Recording: (947/ 2140) 
do i think they will oh yes i think they definitely will i think there is so much heavy uh political and financial well i am gonna reverse that statement uh there is so much heavy financial influence upon the political uh influence that uh it it is almost a forgone conclusion and if it does not occur this within this year and uh there may be another vote in another year or next a next election but i think that in fact it will go 

Recording: (948/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (949/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (950/ 2140) 
you know 

Recording: (951/ 2140) 
yeah that is what i am saying 

Recording: (952/ 2140) 
yeah it uh yeah they they have got two different uh articles in there uh about it well they had a big article uh back when uh who was it jesse jackson was down there or something what a couple years ago or something and uh he made a concerted effort to try to let people know how how <error poverty is down there and everything but then you go to a lot of other extremes you know where you set there and these people would not want to live in columbus so 

Recording: (953/ 2140) 
i mean i think he is done some positive things that whole thing about um as far as like your student loans and being able to get INTO SCHOOL <LAUGH> which has helped me you know and i you know all this that as far as some of the issues go i think that that i feel pretty similar to the way he does um some of his foreign policy things i think have gone pretty decently but i mean i think i do not i do not know i mean it i i 

Recording: (954/ 2140) 
yeah from what i hear actually the like the emory and the um university of chicago you have to work really hard because they get all the kids who wish they would have got into harvard and then start you know try to make it up by working harder you get to actual harvard nobody works because they are like we already made it you know 

Recording: (955/ 2140) 
i i well that is a that is a tough one uh i remember when you know when we were we had you know some movies like that but they were like the bowery boys and stuff you know or it was you pretty much knew it was all fake anyway you know but and to me that is fake and uh uh and i never really thought about when was growing up that it was what was real and everything uh i always knew that by i there again know by my dad being a 

Recording: (956/ 2140) 
he he is a very he is a disappointment 

Recording: (957/ 2140) 
right right 

Recording: (958/ 2140) 
we will do this and we will do this so we checked out the catholic school and they were organized that way and it just was a better better match for him and then my daughter went to school was just easier to take them to the same school and that goes back reminded me of another thing i wanted to say about why the discipline and and behavior may be different in the catholic school is you are paying big you are paying bucks you know it is four forty five hundred dollars a year for us to send her to school 

Recording: (959/ 2140) 
yeah well i figure right now i might as well take advantage of it 

Recording: (960/ 2140) 
yes 

Recording: (961/ 2140) 
businessman my dad and i have been screwing around with stocks for years um been in contact with a um day trading firm down in west virginia and they are starting an intern program sometime i do not even know when but if they if that opens up i will probably seriously consider going down to west virginia they are in richmond west virginia richmond yeah i have been saying west virginia have not i they are in virginia sorry their home base is in um richmond virginia is there 

Recording: (962/ 2140) 
year and then i went into the army in nineteen forty spring of nineteen forty one before pearl harbor and i was in the service for uh four and a half years in italy most of that time north africa and then italy and uh i had met a uh a uh girl before i went in the service and so 

Recording: (963/ 2140) 
when i found out there were so many openings in special ed so and then i found out later that speech therapy is a very good background for l d because a lot of these l d kids have language deficits and language problems they they can not you know like express themselves on paper or they do not process things correctly auditorially so it is the perfect background to work with l d kids i did not know i was doing that at the time but 

Recording: (964/ 2140) 
i made a difference 

Recording: (965/ 2140) 
well that is great 

Recording: (966/ 2140) 
yes and no uh when we were in boy scouts we got kicked out of it <LAUGH> 

Recording: (967/ 2140) 
and uh well she the uh the people that own it are starting to build it up now but it is been like that it was the first apartment community um in columbus it was built in thirty eight i guess 

Recording: (968/ 2140) 
um people that live there i mean we have got the the you know the indian department stores right down there on high street and and a couple of asian groceries but I WAS <LAUGH> you know i i i do not know where they live <LAUGH> i MEAN IT it seems it seems like for those stores to be opening there they must be somewhere in clintonville but i do not i do not know 

Recording: (969/ 2140) 
alright 

Recording: (970/ 2140) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (971/ 2140) 
i do not know i i would not personally like think that the parents should be held responsible i mean they do have you know a certain amount of responsibility for the fact that they should have been more aware and and especially because i mean i believe that those or at least one of the two had been in counseling and had to you know was doing it aggression management or something like that um you know you would think that if they were going through something like that you would just sort of you know maybe 

Recording: (972/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (973/ 2140) 
once the tourists hear about it you know it is like you know 

Recording: (974/ 2140) 
um 

Recording: (975/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (976/ 2140) 
well basically the same thing here but some of your management is real good i have seen people that that you know are super but i have seen people that are bad problem is you get a bad management and it can make your life hell i do not care who you are 

Recording: (977/ 2140) 
all you do is you just keep your records of of um you know what you spend on things and then there is a form you fill out and how much you have if you have taken any depreciation you know you need to basically put that back in and deduct your costs and then there is the percentage that goes on your schedule e that goes on the front of your form that goes into your income and then it is just taxed it is just not it is really not that hard 

Recording: (978/ 2140) 
then 

Recording: (979/ 2140) 
umhum yeah i am just learning the area so but i like it so far it seems really nice and uh ah it seems like there is a lot more to do in columbus obviously but 

Recording: (980/ 2140) 
why do i think that is um 

Recording: (981/ 2140) 
might experiment or try or make a mistake but the way he is handling it saying i am not even gonna dignify that question over and over and over if he did not do it he might as well just be like no i did not do it 

Recording: (982/ 2140) 
downtown which was where this my one of my orchestras plays a lot and uh we sang in other different kinds of churches and said what we liked about them what we did not <LAUGH> maybe it had some feedback i think the new building is acoustically very good it is certainly much better than old worship center because i do not know if you have seen a picture or anything of the church the old worship center was designed by a modern architect to 

Recording: (983/ 2140) 
umhum at this point um i am not uh i am not against the urban schools but if it was my own personal child i would not move to a suburban area until columbus gets their act together they are in so uh such bad shape right now that i do think the state will take over the columbus public schools in two years yeah they have threatened it um and if they do not pull their scores up um they will you know 

Recording: (984/ 2140) 
and move on um that is that is basically my fear but uh as one of the guys tried to help me he said well listen i am afraid of that too and he said because right there in that pit there that is god now if you remember that there is nothing in here that can hurt you even as hot as it gets you know and when you think about that you try not to think too much while you are in there although 

Recording: (985/ 2140) 
or they yeah they come back to visit me sometimes from the high school 

Recording: (986/ 2140) 
yeah it is ridiculous i mean plus its a nationally recognized school so a degree from ohio state i mean you could go anywhere in the nation someone is at least gonna recognize because it is big it is big big name ashland it would be more of a sell i would be like okay we it is small it is private it is accredited but still 

Recording: (987/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (988/ 2140) 
it does not matter how much money they are given for their education they have 

Recording: (989/ 2140) 
yeah i think mostly they did uh i was kind of surprised uh which class was this in i think this was in that introduction to the arts class i was kind of surprised that one of the students in class thought it was very hard <LAUGH> i did not think it was that hard at all but she wrote me some kind of nasty note at the last class or before the last class that she had a straight a average at this school before that my class and i was giving her a b and she was her 

Recording: (990/ 2140) 
uh huh <LAUGH> 

Recording: (991/ 2140) 
uh i do not know where he got the contact but anyway he went up to boone iowa and joined a national guard outfit uh which was field artillery and uh with the expectation of their being mobilized soon which they were and uh so he he was home one weekend and talked to me about it and i thought well field artillery i was exposed to that when i was uh in r o t c at ames so i thought that is be better than carrying 

Recording: (992/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (993/ 2140) 
kids out there that need love and 

Recording: (994/ 2140) 
but and when it came down to it i mean the what was the protest really about you know and i am not being clear so i am not exactly sure where i am going with this i very cynical of uh about about the world i have inherited uh cause i see a world in which my political views have been silenced by fifty years of of you know like international politics sort of like propaganda 

Recording: (995/ 2140) 
um i went to me see i applied to emory harvard duke university of chicago and washington university so i got into three of those and they they were neat places but 

Recording: (996/ 2140) 
i have no IDEA <LAUGH> 

Recording: (997/ 2140)

Recording: (1196/ 2140) 
that is that whatever they call it thirty three that is on the ballot

but um 

Recording: (1262/ 2140) 
well how he felt and knowing that were not neglecting him were two different things we have always emphasized that knowing what is right or knowing that what is just is one thing it is dealing with the emotions is another one 

Recording: (1263/ 2140) 
but he just did not have a very high opinion of the army 

Recording: (1264/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (1265/ 2140) 
yeah well he thinks he can do it 

Recording: (1266/ 2140)

Recording: (1276/ 2140) 
it i i do not know how to tell you that um i mean it it 

Recording: (1277/ 2140)

william is freshman year and every single one of them was accurate it was really really really funny william will lose something expensive by the end of the year and had my bike stolen william will william will and the big one that i was gonna mention was william will either grow in his faith significantly or will go the exact opposite direction and i knew one or the other would happen because i am the i mean my roommate my freshman year for the first quarter was a drug dealer oh 

Recording: (1357/ 2140) 
well i agree that we should help them maybe through some sort of government program but i think what really hurts them the most is the people that actually give them the money on high street because it really does not motivate them to get out of the gutter i mean if they can make a living off of begging change off of college students they are probably gonna stay with that because it is real easy life 

Recording: (1358/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (1359/ 2140) 
not on airplanes but on heating and cooling systems 

Recording: (1360/ 2140) 
it is a lot of the it is looks a look and feel is a lot a lot the same 

Recording: (1361/ 2140) 
YEAH 

Recording: (1362/ 2140) 
and then how satisfying is that to them when you have a chance to talk to them that is where we need to learn more from interview have more meaningful interviews with these people so that we can learn from them they put me on spotlight but we somehow we just do not wanna uh i guess flood them with the we do not wanna get the negative answer because of all might hurt the image of the university oh gee ya know when we who was it katsenmoyer 

Recording: (1363/ 2140) 
uh they are very in to capitalism and their lives are working pretty good for them so 

Recording: (1364/ 2140) 
umhum yeah because they think they are grown they think they are grown and they are like twelve and thirteen and they have been having sex since they were ten and it is just likegosh GOSH and you know how and they are having babies earlier and earlier and it is just really scary 

Recording: (1365/ 2140) 
anything else is a hardware failure and you have to go fix it somewhere else anyway so if you know how to put an operating system on your machine you can start over if you can start over there is no reason to be scared of anything that you do problem number one in playing with computers for most people is being afraid that they are going to break something 

Recording: (1366/ 2140) 
<LAUGH> that is rude <LAUGH> um trying come up with like uh uh a narrative that is both fun and brief okay so um my friend chris and i are upstairs playing on the computer and um my sister is downstairs watching television it is sunday morning and um i am trying to figure out how this game works trying to figure how this game works and then i said i got some information on this game out in the car i am gonna go get it 

Recording: (1367/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1368/ 2140) 
you know there is things about the my dad that and i would not want to live with <LAUGH> uh he is great and he is wonderful to me i mean my dad is really wonderful to me but i mean things like like when my mom had me he he did not pick her up from the hospital i mean it is that kind of stuff that you think what the hell were you thinking 

Recording: (1369/ 2140) 
such a such an idea and that indeed is gonna take away from family i in my way of thinking i can not imagine that i would uh have my wife producing somebody else is child over HERE and i am going to have the same thank you that is fatherly love fatherly value fatherly instincts toward or 

Recording: (1370/ 2140) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (1371/ 2140) 
exactly HUGE 

Recording: (1372/ 2140) 
hum 

Recording: (1373/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (1374/ 2140) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (1375/ 2140) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (1376/ 2140) 
and we would adjust the guns call down shifts until they could come within reasonable close to that 

Recording: (1377/ 2140) 
and a a ten cent store theater i forget a couple other shops and um when orrin was about i do not know five five or maybe six or seven years old he had been explicitly told that he was not to go up there at all so one day grandma gave him i do not know a quarter or 

Recording: (1378/ 2140) 
so 

Recording: (1379/ 2140) 
uh well the problem is is um like say every airline wants to go to new york city and they want all their business men there at eight a m well an airport has so many runways and so many taxi ways and you know like say ten airplanes every ten minutes can come in and out of those airports well they end up shooting like thirty there so instead of letting them all get in the air and staying up there and hold while they are uh you know shooting them in what they do is they 

Recording: (1380/ 2140) 
um all of them the university is divided up in different areas and there is a shop within each area that takes care of all the maintenance needs for those areas usually there are about twenty buildings or so ours is in the northeast area from wexner down through the oval to oh i do not know about uh derby or so around in there and then on over to woodruff 

Recording: (1381/ 2140) 
oh yeah there is always people out there 

Recording: (1382/ 2140) 
um i took a class for word word word processing one and two i took those and um tell you the truth i can not remember if they taught me how to balance a check book out 

Recording: (1383/ 2140) 
yeah i i thought in the beginning i missed mirror lake cafe so bad because the good subs and all that i do not i do not know why i missed them i do not i go back and now i just do not like it anymore 

Recording: (1384/ 2140) 
um it is pretty dangerous drug i would say for the most part um not so much the getting high part of it but just what goes into it 

Recording: (1385/ 2140) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (1386/ 2140) 
just 

Recording: (1387/ 2140) 
there is very definitely 

Recording: (1388/ 2140) 
you know with the computer and everything um he is uh he is a really good handyman he can do anything so he is really helped me he he is really into design and stuff so he likes to paint and um you know he is really open he is learned a lot about gardening for me and you know that is one of my main things is gardening and 

Recording: (1389/ 2140) 
<LAUGH> YEAH 

Recording: (1390/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1391/ 2140) 
umhum umhum 

Recording: (1392/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (1393/ 2140) 
YEAH <LAUGH> exactly so you know once you once you get to a certain degree of uh frustration you need to relieve that somehow so that is pretty much why we moved 

Recording: (1394/ 2140) 
really 

Recording: (1395/ 2140) 
from our friends that have gone yeah with uh their discipline is expelling the child from school while they are expelling them to a home where the parents working where they are just getting three days of free play i mean pretty much to get in trouble and cause more trouble they really are not learning from that 

Recording: (1396/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (1397/ 2140) 
well uh yeah i think it is real important to really good uh get a good uh feel for how you are and all your beliefs and all that they have to really match and um and if they do not um then it is not ever going to work because because there is always gonna be conflict and friction and all that kind of thing so i think it is real important and there is no age limit on that to when you really feel good about yourself and you really know what you want to do then that is the only time that you can really commit and say yeah we 

Recording: (1398/ 2140) 
yeah i think basically normal hours would be like eight to twelve and then you go home during lunch time because that is the big meal of day you go home and eat with your family that is really important 

Recording: (1399/ 2140) 
sunday 

Recording: (1400/ 2140) 
i have not either i never knew that they had so many beaches i mean i know that had a good reputation you know for for like just just just you know just having a great vacation time because nobody ever came back was ready to tell oh yeah this place was terrible you know the weather was bad you know that people were people were rude everybody there they would say so ah you gotta go you gotta go yes it you know it is a long flight but it is well worth the time 

Recording: (1401/ 2140) 
uh i think they lost think ohio state lost because they was just out there ranting and raving and after a while it got out of hand and i 

Recording: (1402/ 2140) 
well that is probably the roof right there so 

Recording: (1403/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1404/ 2140) 
she is very bright she is very she comes from an extremely dysfunctional family her um parents divorced when she was about four her mother is an alcoholic her father said that he would take her with him and then after they got divorced he changed his mind so she is pretty much raised herself it is a big it it is terrible things what she is HAD to go through and she is made it very clear that she will not live with an alcoholic and that is helped straighten him out some and our feeling was never that the alcoholism or 

Recording: (1405/ 2140) 
so i think 

Recording: (1406/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (1407/ 2140) 
i think that basically that is in a nut shell they have reached a point in their life where you know that they are cowards as far as going out and killing themselves but they want to kill themselves slowly by drinking themselves to death or um smoking you know whatever you know smoking uh crack or whatever and uh then just living in a hell i mean 

Recording: (1408/ 2140) 
hm um early admission pathway umhum 

Recording: (1409/ 2140) 
no 

Recording: (1410/ 2140) 
i do not need to work that many HOURS WHAT THE I MEAN 

Recording: (1411/ 2140) 
and you did not have the violence and stuff like that i have never heard and you know i am just using pot right now 

Recording: (1412/ 2140) 
much more widely used once you get into college um but i mean as far as like the pot and just things like that i mean i can not say i see any difference between 

Recording: (1413/ 2140) 
umhum it does 

Recording: (1414/ 2140) 
um probably for the most part i mean as long as they <LAUGH> have a political background of some sort i can not say i see any real difference i mean for the most part they have proven to be able to do anything else any guy can do so 

Recording: (1415/ 2140) 
always really rushed umhum really why is 

Recording: (1416/ 2140) 
hardly at all which i you know it is actually my family is business so um i started working there to help them out but you know as i am been working there for a while i want to move up you know so 

Recording: (1417/ 2140) 
the herbs <LAUGH> the herbs 

Recording: (1418/ 2140) 
i do not think we take up huge amount and then uh we get some of the service through oar net as well which is i think it is just up lane avenue uh they give us the domain name and all that 

Recording: (1419/ 2140) 
um sort of let them make their own decision when they got older what they wanted to do where they wanted to go with it 

Recording: (1420/ 2140) 
you know 

Recording: (1421/ 2140) 
but he is also like i said he is got five kids they live in low income housing they are collecting welfare 

Recording: (1422/ 2140) 
when i threatened to take them to court and it took almost two months after that 

Recording: (1423/ 2140) 
because now they are getting to the age where they are fighting more and you know and you got a boy and a girl and you know it is 

Recording: (1424/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1425/ 2140) 
but then it is like it some evil person back there in the screening room puts some of this junk in there right in the middle and then you go you can not stop and not watch that you KNOW you and if i was in charge of it i would cut some of it out it is NOT THAT IMPORTANT <LAUGH> 

Recording: (1426/ 2140) 
it was not so much of a hate thing it was just more these are the people i like to hang out with if you do not like that that is fine 

Recording: (1427/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1428/ 2140) 
right and i think that you know i think that it is just because you know you do so because i know i have done studies and i took some of those classes and you just think about it that way and i think a lot of these people just you know they say the nurse says something you take everything for a fact and i thought that was kinda strange but i mean i think there is a lot of things that are probably positive enough about it that it i would want to do it for for a while as long as i could 

Recording: (1429/ 2140) 
thirty nine 

Recording: (1430/ 2140) 
i said this will never work i am not interested take it back and he said no no no just let us just work with us just work with us we will we will take care of this so i ended up selling to him for hundred and forty four but it was just funny because i thought he i thought they are never gonna get to where i have to be and we are not even gonna play this game back and forth 

Recording: (1431/ 2140) 
around more than somebody else 

Recording: (1432/ 2140)

yep 

Recording: (1434/ 2140) 
yeah yeah i applied for it and went after it aggressively 

Recording: (1435/ 2140) 
i am not quite sure how to address that because in a in in some some people would say now wait a minute you are talking out of out both sides your mouth the expression is how can you say over here you must have the love of this child in your arms and and then over here you are saying you believe in capital punishment and electrocution 

Recording: (1436/ 2140)

Recording: (1438/ 2140) 
and like uh one of my friends who had the apartment in arlington 

Recording: (1439/ 2140) 
um about fifteen MINUTES my mom and i do not go to far FROM EACH OTHER SO but jason is gonna take the week off and everything so i think that we will we will be able to do that 

Recording: (1440/ 2140) 
yeah and because i back when i was in high school in my a p government class i was paying attention a lot you know like i read the columbus dispatch everyday and i read u s news and world report for my economics class and i was totally caught up with everything 

Recording: (1441/ 2140) 
oh yeah and and i i will probably step on your toes here but i i am not a firm believer of mom and dad both working i my wife worked until we had children then she stayed home and once they got into school she worked at a school so when they were gone she was gone when they were home she was home and you know my parents did not do that and i hated it i hated coming home from school by myself every day there was nobody there to talk to you know and i did it for years and and i just feel that you know i i hope you do not have children yet do you 

Recording: (1442/ 2140) 
vote with the candidate who is gonna put the best justices on the supreme court and i got a lot of people to vote for clinton that way both in ninety two and again in four years in ninety six uh and i think that is gonna happen again uh because the the candidates and i am telling you my politics here VERY CLEARLY and early but the candidates have pretty well spoken on that issue already i know which one will protect the right for choice uh and um uh i think 

Recording: (1443/ 2140) 
you know mixed race or or handicapped or you know hard to place

right umhum there is a lot of uh money money in town here and there is sometimes like you will see a uh one entire airplane that goes to cancun and it is like people are going on vacation or people who are gonna go gambling in jamaica that is all it is so then when that comes in we have these really weird painted airplanes and we are like who is that 

Recording: (1445/ 2140)

Recording: (1450/ 2140) 
and she says it is amazing you can give these give people numbers and they immediately use them wrong they just do not know how to use them uh they completely misinterpret even though it is very clearly stated what they are doing and uh the newspapers do that a lot too 

Recording: (1451/ 2140) 
um one of my best friends from high school and my boyfriend are both in it and they bugged me about it for ever to come and like i do not know about computers <LAUGH> so they took me finally like december something

yeah it is a lot smaller than columbus though 

Recording: (1458/ 2140) 
his speed was like say seventy mile an hour before and now it is gonna be twenty because he does not know how to do it and that is the problem they are running into they have all these qualified people who know how to separate airplanes and how to get them in trail and you know everything but now they have gotta do this extra part which is going to make their job easier down the road but everybody hates change so what they are doing now is it they are having problems because people can not take the volume of airplanes because they are trying to keep up with the computer so it is making it even slower 

Recording: (1459/ 2140) 
medication of his own free will that was his responsibility to take that medicine every day just like it is mine take mine every day and when i stop taking mine that was my responsibility which is why i do not wanna go to the legal system to try and make an excuse even though there is a there is a some law that protects people that if they were drunk or on the influence of medication or or off the influence of medication um in case 

Recording: (1460/ 2140)

well they pretty much put by the test scores they do not sit you down like in private schools they do this they sit you down one to one just like we are and they spend probably you know maybe twenty thirty minutes a day actually getting to know the student what the student still needs for the completion of that grade and once they have figured that you are able to go there then up you go right up the ladder 

Recording: (1468/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1469/ 2140)

Recording: (1485/ 2140) 
she goes well yeah dad they cost money i said oh lord

Recording: (1509/ 2140) 
well no actually my mom did not she was a very bad cook 

Recording: (1510/ 2140) 
yeah it was a homemade bow and arrow 

Recording: (1511/ 2140) 
the majority are the ones that do not get the guidance at home that you are trying to reach ai not gonna go to boy scouts 

Recording: (1512/ 2140) 
right yeah 

Recording: (1513/ 2140) 
trying to feed eight children and it if you are here in a this country any eight children why you have eight children to start with 

Recording: (1514/ 2140) 
yeah and and the problem is uh the problem is seeing things in other people i mean actually seeing spirits in other people in terms of someone said the eyes are the mirror to the soul that is very true you know i could see in certain people is eyes when i was in the hospital the confusion the unsure feelings 

Recording: (1515/ 2140) 
does not that get back more or less to the thing about everybody being me me me now and therefore they really do not so much care about where they came from and what they are and who they are 

Recording: (1516/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (1517/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1518/ 2140) 
really 

Recording: (1519/ 2140) 
it is a yes it is it is a catholic school environment so it will be interesting to see what evolves from the children is uh attention to the the roman catholic side of religion as compared to the baptist so 

Recording: (1520/ 2140) 
right and then they wonder you know i do not know what is happened it is the other person who is changed you know and if you if you start changing your behavior you can usually get the kinds of changes i always figure if you treat people the way that old golden rule thing if you if you give out what you want back you get it 

Recording: (1521/ 2140) 
or like i talked to this one guy he was he was a navy seal and he did like a couple tours in vietnam and he was he was talking about how he is he was drunk and he was he was from alabama he was like yeah i am about half drunk now so i am trying to figure out where this model number is and like I DONT KNOW WE TALKED to him for like FIFTEEN MINUTES 

Recording: (1522/ 2140) 
i think that is great you know i think obviously there is always a down side and but i think that too many people abuse the system and you know unfortunately it is very hard when you know then it ruins it for the people who really do need it and but you know as long as they 

Recording: (1523/ 2140) 
like it is okay i mean it is like a country school which was always real weird too i was always like me and like my friends were always like the because i used to have real long hair and so that was like i used to be like a big hippie or whatever and like um that was i guess weird kind of like being the odd people in a in a small like in a small midwestern farming school it is kind of odd i guess um i do not know um 

Recording: (1524/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (1525/ 2140) 
as much as she could you know we were poor but we managed 

Recording: (1526/ 2140) 
now people like that can not work when i was a kid your family took care of you there was not the welfare and stuff like this but you do not have a family structure no more 

Recording: (1527/ 2140) 
when you think that our major resource is is our children and our offspring then we would better not you know 

Recording: (1528/ 2140) 
an hour at the beverly across the street on neil avenue so um uh but but anyhow you know they could never understand you know well you you never got a job with it you know why would you go to school and waste all that money i it was the best money i ever spent 

Recording: (1529/ 2140)

Recording: (1530/ 2140) 
nope huh um 

Recording: (1531/ 2140) 
and if i was in the SAME SITUATION i would be doing the same thing so 

Recording: (1532/ 2140) 
wow yeah i know 

Recording: (1533/ 2140) 
appeals appeals 

Recording: (1534/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1535/ 2140) 
whole time i was in highschool in college and all this kind of thing but it was just like yeah people just thought oh you are american you are here therefore you must have lots of extra money to throw around and you know they just sort of do not grasp the fact that you know you can have made sacrifices to be there but i do think also in films you know i remember actually being in bristol and that film california with brad pitt and juliette lewis and you know they are in the trailer and everything else 

Recording: (1536/ 2140) 
oh we now run on the gregorian and or that sort of thing back to your question i think you were asking are 

Recording: (1537/ 2140) 
yeah i am actually like a month older than him 

Recording: (1538/ 2140) 
but he would bring in nutritional list or whatever to explain to the parents blah blah blah 

Recording: (1539/ 2140) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (1540/ 2140)

Recording: (1542/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1543/ 2140) 
the uh technical assistance and policy end of it and hated it the other years were fine but those last three were pretty bad uh 

Recording: (1544/ 2140) 
oh my gosh it is a wonder they are not like you know falling out of trees <LAUGH> 

Recording: (1545/ 2140) 
um i talk to him every now and then 

Recording: (1546/ 2140) 
so i mean carrying cabinets and he will do it <LAUGH> long as you are paying him he will do it <LAUGH> 

Recording: (1547/ 2140) 
i am i am not built that way 

Recording: (1548/ 2140) 
well i do think access is too easy but it is sort of like anything else i think if laws were passed the people who were against it would be so you know just beside themselves that it would i do not know for how long but i think it would make the situation not with the shootings and things like that but i think it would make the just the gun situation probably much worse for a while because people would be you know doing illegal things to get guns and that 

Recording: (1549/ 2140) 
just they are that into being sure you are relaxed enough 

Recording: (1550/ 2140) 
but i do not see it as negatively effecting me i still get all the stuff done i need to get done 

Recording: (1551/ 2140) 
two in the eleventh two in the twelfth you can take them as many times as you need to take them but if you do not pass them all by the time you graduate you get this nifty little thing called an attendance certificate it is not a real diploma it is like okay i attended i did not learn anything but i was there 

Recording: (1552/ 2140) 
yeah um i took one oh four during winter quarter 

Recording: (1553/ 2140) 
was really great i mean it is just nice laid back country setting and you do not hafta worry about that much crime well your horse might get taken in middle of night but i do not have any HORSES 

Recording: (1554/ 2140) 
beggars i love it 

Recording: (1555/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (1556/ 2140) 
well he his two main uh main characters in his cartoons were willie and joe 

Recording: (1557/ 2140) 
now what 

Recording: (1558/ 2140) 
oh sure 

Recording: (1559/ 2140) 
but it it is teaching him discipline responsibility you can not do these things at this time you know i 

Recording: (1560/ 2140) 
no it was it was more black than white tell you truth or it might have been even but now it is more black than white definitely now because i i live in a neighborhood where it is it is mostly black than white and that is where i have always lived my whole life 

Recording: (1561/ 2140) 
and b is and um with she had kind of a hard time in high school she was uh raped by a teacher in ninth grade when she first went into a school and from there it is just been a nightmare of what how that it is affected her you know anything she goes through you blame it on that or you go back and you say oh i wonder you know if she was like that because of this and you know so that is been a real struggle and high school i was i never really 

Recording: (1562/ 2140) 
i mean if i would have chosen to do that well it is my choice oh 

Recording: (1563/ 2140) 
and you know people do not have big families like they used to you know so 

Recording: (1564/ 2140) 
uh three years something like that hard to remember <LAUGH> IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO 

Recording: (1565/ 2140) 
i 

Recording: (1566/ 2140) 
yeah yeah yeah 

Recording: (1567/ 2140) 
i never heard a thing about it all the time i was in the service 

Recording: (1568/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1569/ 2140) 
i it is not a presidential candidate issue as far as i am concerned but uh i am 

Recording: (1570/ 2140) 
so it is probably was not unexpected we just were not prepared for it i do not think you could be prepared for it 

Recording: (1571/ 2140) 
so but i had some really tough challenging jobs and yeah if i knew now what i knew then i probably could be a millionaire with all the lawsuits of different yeah i experience with um sexual harassment 

Recording: (1572/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (1573/ 2140) 
and they were in italy and europe and uh there was not the definite enemy in vietnam that there was in europe i think that is part of it and of course the attitude of most of the guys that went to vietnam was a little bit different from from where i was probably is a consequence of our understanding of the the uh 

Recording: (1574/ 2140) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (1575/ 2140) 
yeah i um well and that was really um struggle you know a struggle for money and everything so i would take whatever would come along and when you work in secure jobs like that i mean you i had a different job every year i mean a year would come up and i would say okay here we go you know they are either gonna downsize or they are gonna do something and they always did so i was never really shocked and i did not panic or anything and i was never without a job and never had to i never missed um you know i would say it 

Recording: (1576/ 2140) 
uh we took um uh i took uh military ethics as a philosophy course and that was really interesting because even though in even in that hierarchy there is still certain contexts within the context of war for instance if if we both know if we knowingly go into it as combatants and we are fighting for whatever cause but if we both are willingly going into it 

Recording: (1577/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1578/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1579/ 2140) 
the money behind them they have the lawyers behind them so they can sue for an appeal 

Recording: (1580/ 2140) 
when they drove by i guess 

Recording: (1581/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1582/ 2140) 
same 

Recording: (1583/ 2140)

Recording: (1584/ 2140) 
and that is what i am saying atoning for sins it is quite a hypocrisy when you got a church telling you that you need to ask for forgiveness when what they did i mean in the church in zanesville where i went and buried my grandparents and went to all my life over the door of the church was a picture of christopher columbus with a missionary a priest and all his men with his sword drawn a dead native american at his feet and three more at the side looking on in fear now 

Recording: (1585/ 2140) 
got a pool if you have got a pool table over down the hall i will show you it is kind of <LAUGH> 

Recording: (1586/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1587/ 2140) 
kind of exciting because you are getting in on things that are really new and trying to master it the project i am working on now um it is trying to find a way to automatic to create data that describes web resources so that libraries can take this data and put it in their catalog and integrate it with the regular collection and we are doing a lot of with a yeah it is it is pretty it is pretty neat project a lot of new things who at uh java and the web <LAUGH> give us opportunities do things that 

Recording: (1588/ 2140) 
and decided to pursue the matter to the extent of marriage so that is where they met <LAUGH> no uhhuh i i come down here two or three times like you know just trips through going to the airport and other miscellaneous things but um when i moved to the city i mean it it was a real big change because i have you know used to living in the country and i move into smack dab in the middle of a downtown area 

Recording: (1589/ 2140) 
oh really THATS cute <LAUGH> 

Recording: (1590/ 2140) 
i 

Recording: (1591/ 2140) 
see i do not shut up so i would talk to them the whole time and so they would always be really verbal and so it seemed like they had a much better understanding and could do things better than they really could like when my daughter was about five we got a hamster and i said well you know you make sure you give it food and water and when it died it i was so surprised that she had not given him been giving it food and water because she did it occasionally but to a five year old you do not yeah they do not get that stuff together or when she was eleven we sold her 

Recording: (1592/ 2140) 
oh that is why okay 

Recording: (1593/ 2140) 
motherly instinct towards you know they are all like oh eric you should have one and you know and he knows KNOWS IM NOT GOING TO HAVE ONE um i just knew at a young age i have always loved the animals 

Recording: (1594/ 2140) 
uh yeah so i think she is getting a better education than he did but it is because she is doing the work and and she knows she is expected to has to and he my son is the kind he would rather play than work and so he he rode a lot and 

Recording: (1595/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1596/ 2140) 
just a different time now uh i mean i remember uh one of the things i saw when i was a kid on a newscast you know with uh uh the vietnamese guy uh vietcong guy getting his brains blowed out on national tv you know and uh uh that did not make me go out and um want to do that you know so if anything it made me want not want to do it you know because my brother was in was in vietnam he was in the army 

Recording: (1597/ 2140) 
much in school with that 

Recording: (1598/ 2140) 
it is right on their main street and they have gorgeous really neat unique things 

Recording: (1599/ 2140) 
that is it ah 

Recording: (1600/ 2140) 
with six normal kids because l d kids would be creative and they would think of ways to get out of there and the normal kids would sit and cry 

Recording: (1601/ 2140) 
so i ended up doing that for about three months and ended up flunking out of uh o u in the in the first three months of the first quarter so uh then i got my notice in january so 

Recording: (1602/ 2140) 
you do not slide as much 

Recording: (1603/ 2140) 
she is a cowboy and he was an indian 

Recording: (1604/ 2140) 
now that does not make any extra work for the teacher but it gives him a shot he usually will answer the concepts he will usually answer the main stuff that he knows and if you only grade him on that he might have a shot at a c or a b i mean there is all kind of ways to modify uh give a reduced work amount uh give a kid a copy of another students notes if his are crummy and he can not study from them we even have a thing at our school that it is 

Recording: (1605/ 2140) 
that is true home 

Recording: (1606/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (1607/ 2140) 
for example so you should name her tamara 

Recording: (1608/ 2140) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (1609/ 2140) 
i do not know what it is like to grow up uh anywhere else i uh i know what it is like uh kind of like where my cousin lived in new york because i would go there in the summers but uh hum did i like growing up in COLUMBUS <LAUGH> uh how do you judge that you know what do you compare that to 

Recording: (1610/ 2140) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (1611/ 2140) 
really they they are the biggest assholes <LAUGH> 

Recording: (1612/ 2140) 
uh think when i was five because it was like yeah yeah i do not really remember them being really together 

Recording: (1613/ 2140) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (1614/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1615/ 2140) 
oh i tightened this good it is like it is falling i oh it there it can go cool perfect 

Recording: (1616/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1617/ 2140) 
well also too when is the last time you seen a baseball game kids playing a baseball game in the neighborhood 

Recording: (1618/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1619/ 2140) 
oh they were helping out the the new GUYS 

Recording: (1620/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1621/ 2140) 
yeah i guess they do i do not know what where where where it is or how many they have 

Recording: (1622/ 2140) 
yeah they are gonna most likely raise it up to twenty one since all these uh the kentucky and maryland colorado all those school shootings and can not believe man i mean there is articles in there you would not even believe if you have not read them 

Recording: (1623/ 2140) 
that is where you need to correct you can not just say hey we got a schnook out here we can screw him that is a problem and you are saying does it does it does it take home does it take church it takes morals and that is why i was telling before we got away from morals in our society we could care less about you i always say a a uh good successful salesman will be able to sell his own mother i mean sell his own mother on a on the market 

Recording: (1624/ 2140) 
you know 

Recording: (1625/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1626/ 2140) 
i do not have a good opinion of uh columbus schools at all no not at all 

Recording: (1627/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1628/ 2140) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (1629/ 2140) 
of the puzzle that that helps i think matthew shepherd helped also 

Recording: (1630/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1631/ 2140) 
because the problem with guns in my opinion is you do not have to think to use it it takes you know you do not have to sit there and load it and in a split second i think we all are capable of shooting somebody for whatever reason you know just stupidity or whatnot i do not just in a split second you know we we might have that once in a life where we can kill somebody that quickly and you can not go oh you know 

Recording: (1632/ 2140) 
when i retire uh i would like to move like to mount sterling or something like that 

Recording: (1633/ 2140) 
should be tried and hopefully convicted on the facts and should not have anything else added into it i i think doing that is going to do the same thing that the many of the civil rights and the uh affirmative action programs and the busing did to people it is going to turn people against uh gays like it turned people against blacks for a while although ultimately i think it did make a difference i i had a i have a black friend at the ohio education association who was very active in the sixties 

Recording: (1634/ 2140) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (1635/ 2140) 
yeah probably hafta go to dublin or you know worthington somewhere around there to find couple millionaires but uh 

Recording: (1636/ 2140) 
you know 

Recording: (1637/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1638/ 2140) 
it is major things that you have to do that are a lot more time consuming 

Recording: (1639/ 2140) 
they 

Recording: (1640/ 2140)

yeah 

Recording: (1644/ 2140) 
it is an island but a planet together i liked it there i kinda like and i figure they will probably hook up but i do not like how the show this show and this happened with deep space nine two and even with next generation for a little bit how the show is become soap opera like um i mean the romantic aspects of the stories do not really appeal to me very much um i am more interested in the social things and you know good old special effects um but 

Recording: (1645/ 2140) 
oh that is right 

Recording: (1646/ 2140) 
but she was never interested in and never really interested in boys or in sports in high school or uh make up and clothes and things like that and you know you are setting yourself up for ridicule in high school for that and that is what happened she would come home in tears because kids made fun of her and stuff and finally she just stopped going and within a couple months she got her g e d 

Recording: (1647/ 2140) 
and i do have a brother 

Recording: (1648/ 2140)

Recording: (1649/ 2140) 
gotten somewhere else 

Recording: (1650/ 2140) 
nope 

Recording: (1651/ 2140) 
to you know to art whatever it is wherever it comes from and there is not the is not you know there is not the the old boy network you know not as not as much who you know to get into things uh or or that women are allowed to know the people that the boys know so it is not it is not as closed off that way 

Recording: (1652/ 2140) 
okay 

Recording: (1653/ 2140) 
it was it was especially it was my job but <LAUGH> as you know the parents always get stuck <LAUGH> i have a brother 

Recording: (1654/ 2140)

Recording: (1656/ 2140) 
<LAUGH> oh 

Recording: (1657/ 2140)

Recording: (1658/ 2140) 
most of them are still sadly just sitting there and following my directions but they are getting better 

Recording: (1659/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1660/ 2140)

Recording: (1661/ 2140) 
today so yes in my opinion definitely it is eroding i know you took a little different approach in answering the question uh from over the time that that this kind of thing is eroding based upon the word respect <LAUGH> 

Recording: (1662/ 2140) 
it is a traffic jam and i am not moving as i am 

Recording: (1663/ 2140)

<LAUGH> YEAH <LAUGH> 

Recording: (1665/ 2140) 
birmingham alabama <LAUGH> 

Recording: (1666/ 2140) 
um so i am sure that PROBABLY increases the rate in public schools from 

Recording: (1667/ 2140) 
because like i said it all came together because i do not understand how people can let their kids be hurt but 

Recording: (1668/ 2140) 
no 

Recording: (1669/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (1670/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (1671/ 2140) 
yeah like like sort of i mean with like m p threes and stuff people do a lot of that but it is it is i do not i do not know i do not i do not really go on the internet all that much like i do not know 

Recording: (1672/ 2140) 
oh yeah yeah we all get together we have to get a shelter house now somewhere because uh NOBODYS HOUSE is big enough well and then we have so many little kids that it is great because uh we just go to a shelter inside and they have it you know like for christmas and things like that and they can run around the kids run around and 

Recording: (1673/ 2140) 
umhum umhum but i do not know if that is i think that the divorce rate has gone up because it is more socially acceptable i am sure there is plenty of people twenty years ago that would have loved to have GOTTEN A DIVORCE had that been an option um i i think it just i think a lot of it is just depends on the way you handle it you know how you how you handle it after after the the divorce is final i mean not do you see does that make any sense at all 

Recording: (1674/ 2140) 
um i mean obviously it is something that happens everyday and things likethat um <LAUGH> like said by no means am i saying yay go president clinton or anything likethat but um i mean i can not say i would hold it against him for doing something like that i mean it isnothing that threatened the nation or whatever 

Recording: (1675/ 2140) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1676/ 2140) 
like on a fairly regular basis even 

Recording: (1677/ 2140)

and uh the other one is um a uh working cuff at the steubenville ohio uh 

Recording: (1684/ 2140) 
i am not sure i do not know his his dad found it and told me about it because i was not working at the time and we were trying to get an extra income to come in and um his dad made actually like twenty five dollars or something you know i would think he would make more than that because man every time we go over there he is up on the computer doing something so and i am on there you know just i look up baby stuff get coupons and stuff um

Recording: (1708/ 2140) 
to stop without it um and and that is too bad you know that things things are have been that bad in some like oh world war two i mean we did not really have any choice there not that but uh some of the some of our wars have been unnecessary and uh so but you know you can get you can get a philosophy but 

Recording: (1709/ 2140) 
because they f always dress up and everything when they go to the bars 

Recording: (1710/ 2140) 
or been around you know but um more i think doctors should more look on that avenue you know that possibly it is something else like that i have never had a doc well now with the forms you fill out with your physicians and they ask you if you know about allergies and usually it is um prescriptions and things you know i mean that you have taken but they i do not know i think a lot of things have to do with food allergies anymore i really do

Recording: (1726/ 2140) 
and he is real because people give him that 

Recording: (1727/ 2140) 
i think more what they need to do is in strict or uh just make stiffer penalties to people that carry the guns or that are involved in shootings and things like that um because i mean for the most part i mean people really do not get too badly punished for things i mean if you look in other countries i mean like people like the asian countries places like that i mean they have really strict laws i mean if you even get caught for like 

Recording: (1728/ 2140) 
you know because then what does he have to hide and then like the fact that he did not know like i think in international policy he will be struggling if he becomes president he did not know the three leaders of the world thing and then on top of it like texas is a fairly big economy but still like to manage an entire you know an entire economy

Recording: (1738/ 2140) 
they are ready to move on again you just do not get as close to people as you used to 

Recording: (1739/ 2140)

umhum 

Recording: (1752/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (1753/ 2140) 
where they are almost segregating themselves by having these organizations because they are geared specifically towards black people and i think in a way that is almost segregating themselves from the rest of the community because they are not giving out equal opportunity to the people that need em um it is sort of like the same thing white people were doing you know thirty forty years ago where that they had they are white organizations or what not um and i think it is sort of going along the same lines 

Recording: (1754/ 2140) 
that would be neat that would be real neat <LAUGH> but that is dream world so 

Recording: (1755/ 2140) 
you can not especially with kids it is just too overwhelming 

Recording: (1756/ 2140) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (1757/ 2140) 
i do not know uh maybe i think maybe if teachers just their status in society is not real high when it should be um it is more like i you know i have heard that like garbage men get paid more than teachers you know and how but it um so it is just like people always talk about you know education for the you know we gotta like think about our child is future or whatever but really teachers are paid crap AND like do not really get a lot of respect from anybody like professors and stuff get 

Recording: (1758/ 2140) 
yeah if they want if they you know choose i am i am sure there is you know women that are lesbians that have been with men also you know they have been with a man and then they have been with the woman now now they got a girlfriend so obviously you know and i feel like that was because they have they had a attraction towards a woman so now they think they are lesbian i do not see i do not that is why i think so i do not think that but if that is their choice that is their choice so i do think they could change <LAUGH> 

Recording: (1759/ 2140) 
um i would say it does not REALLY MATTER either way honestly i mean fact of the matter is they are so deal with it i mean get over it i mean 

Recording: (1760/ 2140) 
um i think i think through education that is it is just gonna only help 

Recording: (1761/ 2140)

Recording: (1820/ 2140) 
saying that if you have a fourth or a half

Recording: (1831/ 2140) 
well i believe it is quality not quantity uh ideally you know um one parent would be there be it male or female well you know man or man or or lady but uh but you know your quality time is more important you know maybe go come home and you and all you wanna do is sit down and start watching tv or drinking beer or whatever you know and not spend any time with your child it does not matter whether you are there all day or whether you are there for two hours 

Recording: (1832/ 2140)

did not want the world war two vision anymore uh and i thought that was was was kind of interesting because by and large most young people also supported reagan and i thought do they really understand the difference in issues and what the two stand for but it was that reagan appeared young and charismatic and so did clinton so i think for the average voter that does have a a lot of sway 

Recording: (1842/ 2140) 
you do not you do not use coupons 

Recording: (1843/ 2140)

Recording: (1899/ 2140) 
yeah i mean it is like it is known but it is in a different way it is like a different type of fame than like traditional style so it is like more of like a respect as opposed to like an admiration type thing like like it is more of like a it is not like an m t v type thing you know 

Recording: (1900/ 2140) 
and you know i just really think they need to make that and not uh an option for a young girl i really do because there is just you know there is just too many unwanted children there just is and that really bothers me that we do not have another option like another country um we are a lot more right wing here in america but i just feel that is got to be an option you know for these young girls it just really does 

Recording: (1901/ 2140)

Recording: (1907/ 2140) 
and your display might be different but it is it is basic information and i and we developed the system that people started doing that on is sharing the data um actually it started here on o s u campus and now we are independent 

Recording: (1908/ 2140) 
and that is essentially what the supreme court said in their last decision on this two three years ago what they said was whether we think it is right or wrong whether we think the previous supreme court was right or wrong it is been a part of this fabric of this country for more than ten years and to reverse it would create too much too many problems for people you know which i thought was a nice way of saying sorry folks but you know it is too late 

Recording: (1909/ 2140) 
that is exactly what it IS <LAUGH> 

Recording: (1910/ 2140) 
um i think i think that there should be a mandatory because you have it in big companies you have mandatory um sexual harassment tapes and and you learn you teach the girls that it is not what they do it is how they make you feel is is constituted as your uh yeah harassment there and they are too afraid and then besides that they you know there is crushes on you know you can not fault the girls for having crushes and things like that they are going through enough things as it is

well uh the first THE the first thing is CLINTONVILLE 

Recording: (1914/ 2140)

yeah right can not take it with you or something yeah 

Recording: (1920/ 2140) 
well no she sort of knows this is what she has to say at school if she is asked on a test because she needs the points for a grade 

Recording: (1921/ 2140) 
the bad place is the television things that they have on the programs they have on and i think that that is had a lot to do with changing our younger generation and the way they think the way they act what their morals are and i think that is why they are having more shootings in schools and uh i uh the programs are terrible i think that they need to really redo them there is too much profanity there is too much sex there is too much just do what i want i gotta do my own thing that is where the when i want to do my own thing started he says with the women is feminist MOVEMENT <LAUGH>

Recording: (1933/ 2140)

Recording: (1953/ 2140)

Recording: (2011/ 2140) 
neither side is gonna do anything about it somebody should have did something about that because then you know they would have been doing what they were supposed to do to make him you know get in line and uh so he knew he could get by with it

Recording: (2019/ 2140)

so we DID IT it is well he is always had some problems it is um his problem is staying focused on things unless it is something he is extremely interested in then you can not get him away from it um if it is something he it is the just an example in school he would sit there and he would be rolling around on the floor and stuff while they are trying to teach something in class or working on a writing assignment or something and half hour to work on it 

Recording: (2021/ 2140)

Recording: (2022/ 2140) 
you know they all get uh side lined and side tracked by special private interests and that is that is the bottom line and it is sad but there is so i choose not to involve myself in that as much as possible we ended up settling for 

Recording: (2023/ 2140) 
what i have liked so much about it is they tell you everything and then you find out that it is not right and that it is wrong i mean there was the episode 

Recording: (2024/ 2140)

Recording: (2029/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (2030/ 2140) 
i think the one of the things that we when when you are baptized is that you are really supposed to help other people to like if if somebody gives you a gift you wanna give it to someone else but it is easy a lot of times just to fall into the you know like mold of not letting anyone know what you believe and just so that they think well what are those weirdos you know they do not wear makeup or whatever but we we can wear makeup if 

Recording: (2031/ 2140)

Recording: (2056/ 2140)

Recording: (2057/ 2140) 
not really <LAUGH> oh i i feel a huge difference for me personally um just in the um closeness and being able to pick up on his cues a lot better and just knowing his needs

Recording: (2061/ 2140)

Recording: (2069/ 2140) 
umhum yeah yeah it is been glamorized and they do not they do not value human life either i do not think because there is so much violence you know you can not watch tv and not seeing somebody get shot or something and it is just like it is not really real because it is you know you turn the channel and you see the same actor doing something else and you are like see it was not real and i do not think they i think

Recording: (2075/ 2140) 
nuns or anything there i mean um you know i think they were sort of more concerned with you know it it actually it might have been later than the first um sex education we had that young i mean it might have been more like a like eight grade that they talked about condoms i doubt that they would have done that that early now that i think about it but i know that there was at one point you know some sort of 

Recording: (2076/ 2140) 
right right 

Recording: (2077/ 2140)

Recording: (2086/ 2140) 
everybody is living longer everybody is uh there is more medical things where people get uh can be healed from things that they could not be healed from uh so everybody today is living uh basically as today as their future where back thirty years ago i mean when i was a kid you know i mean i was not really thinking about today i mean i was thinking about tomorrow 

Recording: (2087/ 2140) 
that is the thing but the thing is some people some people say some people say well watch this the thing is why do not you talk to those people and say hey why not do what i am doing best in other words compliment the team 

Recording: (2088/ 2140) 
yeah 

Recording: (2089/ 2140) 
um i think it is probably some of both i think it is probably more but i mean obviously they are gonna have different views on how things work um but i mean for the most part i can not see that as being too big of a problem um obviously there are more like violent guys out there and things like that then there are women but at the same time i would not say there is anything too over 

Recording: (2090/ 2140) 
i no i never i never looked into that but that is a good suggestion they yeah like like being the the they are gonna be like like spanish instructors no i i never thought about that not until you just just uh just just said it so yeah or like teaching english as a second language i know they teach those classes here so i was thinking well you know maybe i should start looking into like teaching classes i was like well i did not know if that was like true or not that you can actually teach around

Recording: (2093/ 2140) 
YEAH 

Recording: (2094/ 2140) 
right 

Recording: (2095/ 2140) 
um i think i think through education that is it is just gonna only help kids because a lot times maybe they do not get that at home so they are really looking to choose the right thing to do 

Recording: (2096/ 2140) 
a lot of exciting stuff going on now at the libraries it is not not the old you know old lady in the bun yeah yeah and the web has really changed that 

Recording: (2097/ 2140)

i always wished somebody would redo a survey on that and say you know back in sixty five or whatever what is the difference between what they are teaching them then and what they teach them now is it really that or is it just our imagination just do not remember enough yeah it seems more to me and computers really have helped it 

Recording: (2108/ 2140) 
umhum 

Recording: (2109/ 2140) 
yeah it it might and you know good teachers do that i i i still get upset when i was teaching school i did activity based teaching um and i was doing some volunteer work at dublin schools it was supposed be one of the better schools in the area and i thought there would be all sorts of creative things going on and there was not it was still read the chapter write the answers to the questions at the end of the book and i thought how boring i mean there are different ways to get kids turned on to things um i am not sure there is so much influence
